<h2><u>What is BRIDGES? 
</u></h2> <p><a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io/index.html"> BRIDGES</a> 
is an API/Toolkit for providing
easy-to-use interfaces to real-world data and internet-based 
information systems, that are exciting and engaging, such as social 
network data (Reddit), entertainment (actors, movies, songs),  encyclopaedia type 
systems (Wikipedia, Gutenberg books), scientific/engineering (USGIS 
Earthquakes) or geographic (city, county, countries, OpenStreet Map, Elevation),
entertainment repositories (IMDB, GeniusAPI, Wikidata) data. The BRIDGES toolkit 
provides a set of classes in C++, Java and Python, to support early CS courses,
such CS1/CS2 and Data Structures/Algorithm Analysis. See the 
</u></h2> <a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io/index.html"> BRIDGES</a>
home page for examples and a short video on an introduction to
BRIDGES.

<h2><u>What does BRIDGES mean to you and your students? </u></h2>
BRIDGES makes it easy to (1) import, use and manipulate real-world data 
sets as part of routine student programming projects, and 
(2) provides visualizations of the data structures, plots of complexity 
measures, 2D, 3D game grids, all constructed/used by the student as part of 
his/her class assignments.</p>

<p>Over 2500 students across 20+ universities, colleges and high schools
have been impacted by the project.  Course appropriate to use BRIDGES include
CS1, CS2, Data Structures, Algorithm Analysis, Object Oriented Programming, Software
Engineering. Materials that are appropriate for high schools are also under development 
See the  </u></h2> <a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io/bridges-hs"> BRIDGES
High School</a> link for more information.  Surveys of students and 
instructors using BRIDGES have been quite positive, and pre/post knowledge 
tests have shown significant gains.</p> 


<h2><u>What does BRIDGES Provide? </u></h2>
<ol>
<li> <b>CS1/CS2: </b>  BRIDGES provides capabilities such as a <b>Game Grid</b> 
for implementing game-based assignments that can be highly engaging, as well
as those focusing on typical learning goals in these courses (arrays, control
structures, indexing, search), with many assignments adapted from the
<a href = "http://nifty.stanford.edu/">Nifty assignments</a> collection.</li>
<p>
<li>  <b>Data Structures/Algorithms:</b> BRIDGES provides 
infrastructure (benchmarking tools and scaffolds) to run algorithms 
of varying data sizes  and generate plots of complexity; this will be 
useful to give students a 
stronger foundation in CS, and serve to compare different algorithms or 
data structures to solve the same problem. Data structures 
(trees, graphs, lists) constructed using BRIDGES can be visualized with
real-world data used as part of the project. See for example a 
<a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io/assignments/data//29-SortingBenchmark/README.html"> Sorting example </a>,
<a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io/assignments/data//9-ShortestPathOSM/README.html"> Shortest Path </a> example using Open Street Map data.
<a href = "https://github.com/BridgesUNCC/bridges-assignments/tree/master/assignmentdb/60-Quadtree-CityData">Spatial Data Structures (Quadtrees)</a>
example for spatial search.
</li>
<p>
<li> <b> 
<a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io/newassignments.html">
BRIDGES Assignment Repository:</a></b>  A repository of BRIDGES assignments
is now maintained that will help incorporate assignments in existing courses. 
Descriptions, scaffolded code, sample images of expected output, and 
solutions (upon request by instructor) are part of each assignment.
<p>
</li>
<li> <b>Datasets:</b> Earthquake data, Open Street Map, Reddit data,
Wikidata, Audio data (song, 1D signals), Gutenberg book collection, 
IMDB actor/movies,  can now be accessed via BRIDGES; Elevation data for 
any region of the world.
<p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2><u> Call for Participation </u></h2> <p>
We are  interested in adopters and partners  who are willing to  
collect student  feedback (typically 3 BRIDGES projects, each followed by an
online Qualtrics survey, managed by the BRIDGES evaluator), to measure the 
impact of BRIDGES on student performance and engagement</b>. 
Instructors from colleges teaching any of the introductory
CS courses listed above  are welcome to participate.  
We have <b>instructor stipends</b> available to support this effort as 
follows: 
<ul> <li> <b>Data Structures/Algorithms Courses:</b> 
	<ul> 
		<li> We are particularly interested in <b>instructors teaching 
		data structures/algorithms courses with a diverse set of students, as our 
		current goals are aimed at understanding the 
		impact of BRIDGES by demographics (race, ethnicity, gender)</b>
	<li> Additionally, in an effort to increase student engagement, our 
		goal is to <b>provide instructors with a small pool of BRIDGES 
		assignments with equivalent learning outcomes</b> for use in their course 
		for each assignment, whereby students <b>get to choose an assignment</b> 
		based on their interest or preference.
	<li> BRIDGES investigators will work with the instructors to look at samples of
			assignments they  are planning to use in their course, prior to
			building a pool of BRIDGES assignments.
	</ul>
	<li> <b> CS1/CS2 Courses:</b> We will continue supporting instructors using 
			BRIDDGES in CS1/CS2 courses; we are currently investigating using similar ideas
			and introducing more flexibility in assignments in these courses.
	
</p>

<h3><u> BRIDGES Support, Activities, Community Building:</u></h3>

<p>The BRIDGES team will provide full technical support to instructors 
and students who are  utilizing BRIDGES as part of their courses. Depending on the level of support needed, this can include stipends for data collection 
and/or TA support/training In addition, we will have the following support/activites for BRIDGES users:</p>
<ol> 
<li> <b>BRIDGES Monthly Meetings:</b> BRIDGES adopters will be invited to monthly meetings to meet with other
BRIDGES users, raise issues of concern, and suggestions towards future BRIDGES
features/development. This would also serve as  a forum for updating users with
new features, assignments and datasets in BRIDGES. <p>
<li> <b>BRIDGES Training:</b>The BRIDGES PIs can provide additional training 
to new BRIDGES users, working with them on a regular basis to improve their courses by leveraging BRIDGES. Additional stipends will be provided for long-term 
commitment to adopt BRIDGES.<p>
<li> <b>BRIDGES Summit:</b> A 1-day event  at the end of the year, that 
will bring all BRIDGES  users and any new potential users interested in 
using BRIDGES, for discussions on experiences using BRIDGES, future plans, etc.. <p>
</ol>

<p>Please contact us if you are interested:</p>
