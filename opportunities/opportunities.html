<h2><u>What is BRIDGES? 
</u></h2> <p><a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io/index.html"> BRIDGES</a> 
is an API/Toolkit for providing
easy-to-use interfaces to real-world data and internet-based 
information systems, that are exciting and engaging, such as social 
network data, entertainment (movies, songs),  encyclopaedia type 
systems (Wikipedia, literature), scientific/engineering or geographic
(OpenStreet Map, Elevation) data. The BRIDGES toolkit provides a 
set of classes in C++, Java or  Python, to support early CS courses,
such CS1/CS2 and Data Structures/Algorithm Analysis. See the 
</u></h2> <a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io/index.html"> BRIDGES</a>
website home page for examples and a short video on an introduction to
BRIDGES.

<h2><u>What does BRIDGES mean to you and your students? </u></h2>
BRIDGES makes it easy to (1) import, use and manipulate real-world data 
sets as part of routine student programming projects, and 
(2) provides visualizations of the data structures, plots of complexity 
measures, game grids,  all constructed/used by the student as part of 
his/her class assignments.</p>

<h2><u>What does BRIDGES Provide? </u></h2>
<ol>
<li>  <b>Data Structures/Algorithms:</b> BRIDGES provides 
infrastructure (benchmarking tools and scaffolds) to run algorithms 
of varying data sizes  and generate plots of complexity; this will be 
useful to give students a 
stronger foundation in CS, and serve to compare different algorithms or 
data structures to solve the same problem. Data structures 
(trees, graphs, lists) constructed using BRIDGES can be visualized with
real-world data used as part of the project. See for example a 
<a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io/assignments/data//29-SortingBenchmark/README.html"> Sorting example </a> and 
<a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io/assignments/data//9-ShortestPathOSM/README.html"> Shortest Path </a> example using Open Street Map data.
<p>
<li> <b>CS1/CS2: </b>  BRIDGES provides capabilities such as a <b>Game Grid</b> 
for implementing game-based assignments that can be highly engaging, as well
as those focusing on typical learning goals in these courses (arrays, control
structures, indexing, search), with many assignments adapted from the
<a href = "http://nifty.stanford.edu/">Nifty assignments</a> collection.
<p>
<li> <b> 
<a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io/newassignments.html"></b>
BRIDGES Assignment Repository:</a>  A repository of BRIDGES assignments
is now maintained that will help incorporate assignments in existing courses. 
Descriptions, scaffolded code, sample images of expected output, and 
solutions (upon request by instructor) are part of each assignment.
</li>
<p>
<li> <b>Datasets:</b> Earthquake data, Open Street Map, Wikidata, Audio 
data (song, 1D signals) can now be accessed via BRIDGES; Elevation 
data for any region of the world.
</li>
</ol>

<h2><u>Impact:</u></h2> 

<p>Close to 2000 students across 10+ universities and colleges
have been impacted by the project.  Surveys of students and pre/post 
knowledge tests have been quite positive.</p> 

<h2><u> Call for Participation </u></h2> <p>
We are  interested in adopters and partners who are willing to  
collect student  feedback (typically 3 BRIDGES projects, each followed by an
online Qualtrics survey, managed by the BRIDGES evaluator), to measure the impact of BRIDGES 
on student performance and engagement</b>. We have <b>instructor stipends</b>
available to support this effort. 
</p>

<h3><u> BRIDGES Support, Activities, Community Building:</u></h3>

<p>The BRIDGES team will provide full technical support to instructors 
and students who are  utilizing BRIDGES as part of their courses.  
In addition, we will have the following support/activites for BRIDGES users:</p>
<ol> 
<li> <b>BRIDGES Monthly Meetings:</b> BRIDGES adopters will be invited to monthly meetings to meet with other
BRIDGES users, raise issues of concern, and suggestions towards future BRIDGES
features/development. This would also serve as  a forum for updating users with
new features, assignments and datasets in BRIDGES. <p>
<li> <b>BRIDGES Training:</b>The BRIDGES PIs can provide additional training 
to new BRIDGES users, working with them on a regular basis to improve their courses by leveraging BRIDGES. Additional stipends will be provided for long-term 
commitment to adopt BRIDGES.<p>
<li> <b>BRIDGES Summit:</b> A 1-day event  at the end of the year, that 
will bring all BRIDGES  users and any new potential users interested in 
using BRIDGES, for discussions on experiences using BRIDGES, future plans, etc.. <p>
</ol>

<p>Please contact us if you are interested:</p>
