	<b>Step 2: Create BRIDGES Account</b> 
	 	Visit the Bridges 
	 	<a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io"> main page</a> 
	    	and create yourself an account by clicking the login button
	    	on the top navigation bar.  Click "Sign Up!" near the bottom of the page. Please ensure that

            used as part of the web link for your projects.
	    	After creating your account, click 
	    	on the profile tab in the upper right corner to 
	    	view your profile. Here will see your account details and
	    	<b>API Key</b>; you will need this API key later
	    	in the tutorial (as well as in every BRIDGES program 
	    	you write). <b>NOTE:Make sure to remember 
	    	your password</b>.

	<b>Step 3: Get Installation template to install BRIDGES and its Dependencies</b> 
	Repl.it allows Repls (programs) to be installed via a template mechanism;
	You will import a BRIDGES C++ Replit template from a git repository, and 
	create an example BRIDGES program. This involves the following steps.
	<ul> 
		<li> Once you are logged in, look for the <b> + Create</b> button on the top
		of the <b>left side bar</b>; click on the button (see adjacent image)
		<li> Click on the <b> Import from Github </b>  button on the top right of the
			popup window. Click on <i>from URL</i> at the top of the window and enter the following URL: <b>https://github.com/BridgesUNCC/bridges-cpp-replit-template</b>. Finally, click on the <b>Import  from Github</b> button. 
		<li> The BRIDGES program will load (takes a few seconds!) and you you will see the
			IDE popup wih an editor on the left and a console on the right 
			(see adjacent image). Click on the file CxxTest.cpp and you will 
			see the trivial BRIDGES Hello World  program.
	</ul>

        <li> Set an assignment number, and your credentials (assignment number, BRIDGES 
			user name and API key) in the line that creates the Bridges object  at the 
			beginning of the program.
        <li> Run the program by hitting the <b> Run </b>  button 
        <li> You will see a link printed on the console. Use that to visualize the
            output.

	<b> Please Note:</b> 
	<ul> 
	<li> <b> For Instructors:</b> The easiest way to get students set up with
		replit is as follows:
		<ul> 
			<li> Create a C++ Replit template as detailed above (Steps 1,2, 3). </li>
			<li> Decide on the scaffold C++ program you want to create 
				for your students to get started on your assignment and 
				make that part of the Repl; if this has more than 1 source
				file, then these can be added to the Makefile in the SRCS line.
			<li> Save the repl and go back to your list of repls.</li>
			<li> Publish your repl (blue button on the top right); follow the
				steps and you will see a link that can be transmitted to the
				students </li>
			<li> Students can use the link to clone the repl and get started
				on their assignment; they will need no additional setup, unless
				they add new source files, or change their source file 
				names, etc (Makefile will need editing). </li>
		</ul>
	<li> Each new repl (BRIDGES program) will require the above steps to access
		the BRIDGES API. </li>
	<li> Note that a specific BRIDGES program might require additional
		include files. Refer to the <a href = "https://bridgesuncc.github.io/doc/cxx-api/current/html/index.html"> BRIDGES C++ documentation</a> and  <a href = "https://bridgesuncc.github.io/tutorials/Overview.html"> BRIDGES Tutorials</a> for additional help.
	<li> A typical C++ program will have multiple source and include files. 
		The additional source files must be specified in the Makefile that is 
		part of each project. Additional source files will be added to the
		<b> SRCS </b> line in the Makefile. The example illustrated above shows a program 
		with a single source file, <i> CxxTest.cpp</i>
