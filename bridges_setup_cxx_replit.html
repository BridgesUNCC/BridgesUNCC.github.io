	 	Visit the Bridges

	    	on the top navigation bar.  Please ensure that

            used as part of the web link for your projects.
	    	After creating your account, click 
	    	on your profile name in the upper right corner to 
	    	view your profile. Once in your profile, you will see your
	    	<b>API Key</b>; you will need this API key later
	    	in the tutorial (as well as in every BRIDGES program 
	    	you write). <b>NOTE:Make sure to remember 
	    	your password</b>.

	<b>Step 3: Get Installation template to install BRIDGES and its Dependencies</b> 
	Repl.it allows Repls (programs) to be installed via a template mechanism;
	You will import a BRIDGES C++ Replit template from a git repository, that will
	create an example BRIDGES program. This involves the following steps.
	<ul> 
		<li> Once you are logged in, look for the blue <b> + Create</b> button on the top
		of the <b>left side bar</b>; click on the button (see adjacent image)
		<li> Click on the <b> Import from Github </b>  button on the top right of the
			popup window and enter <b>https://github.com/BridgesUNCC/bridges-cpp-replit-template</b> , and click on the <b>Import  from Github</b> button. 
		<li> The BRIDGES program will load (takes a few seconds!) and you you will see
			IDE popup wih an editor on the left and a console on the right 
			(see adjacent image). Click on the file CxxTest.cpp and you will 
			see the trivial BRIDGES Hello World  program.
	</ul>

l"> 
            BRIDGES Tutorial</a> site and copy/paste a C++ tutorial program into 
            the main window.
        <li> Set an assignment number, and your credentials (assignment number, BRIDGES 
			user name and API key) in the line that creates the Bridges object  at the 
			beginning of the program.
        <li> Run the program by hitting the <b> Run </b>  button 
        <li> You will see a link printed on the console. Use that to visualize the
            output.

	<b> Please Note:</b> 
	<ul> 
	<li> Each new repl (BRIDGES program) will require the above steps to access
		the BRIDGES API. 
	<li> Note that a specific BRIDGES program might require additional
		include files. Refer to the <a href = "https://bridgesuncc.github.io/doc/cxx-api/current/html/index.html"> BRIDGES C++ documentation</a> and  <a href = "https://bridgesuncc.github.io/tutorials/Overview.html"> BRIDGES Tutorials</a> for additional help.
	<li> A typical C++ program will have multiple source and include files. 
		The additional source files must be specified in the Makefile that is 
		part of each project. Additional source files will be added to the
		<b> SRCS </b> line in the Makefile. The example illustrated above shows a program 
		with a single source file, <i> CxxTest.cpp</i>
	<li> <b>We have noticed that the .replit file is not getting imported correctly as there is already a .replit file in the newly created repl; in this case, you can delete the existing .replit file (needs to be done manually for now on the console or shell). Then copy the .replit file contents (its just 3 lines) into a a new .replit file). We are working on a better solution.</b>
