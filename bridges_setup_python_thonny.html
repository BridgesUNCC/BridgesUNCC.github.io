	  <b>Step 2: Create Bridges Account</b>
	  <ul> <li> Visit the Bridges
	      <a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io">
		main page</a> and create yourself an account
	      by clicking the login button
	      on the top navigation bar. Then, click 'Sign Up!' near the bottom of the window. <b>Please ensure that
		  your user id is devoid of spaces, as it will be
		  used as part of the web link for your projects.</b>
	      After creating your account, click on the profile tab
	      in the upper right corner to view your
	      account details. Once in your profile, you will see your
	      API Key; you will need this API key later in the tutorial (as well as in every BRIDGES program
	      you write).

				bring up a pop up window to show the packages currently installed on
				the system (see adjacent window); the window shows BRIDGES already 
				installed. If you dont see it (very likely!) type <i>bridges</i> in the
				search bar and once it shows up, click on it and install the Bridges 
				package.  You should see a package list as shown in the adjacent image.
				Go back to the main IDE.

		<li> Thonny saves programs on the local drive; Save your program by clicking on
			<i> File-->Save</i> and pick a convenient location in your file system.
		<li> Set an assignment number, and your credentials in the line that creates 
			the Bridges object  at the beginning of the program.
		<li> Run the program by hitting the <b> play </b>  
		<li> You will see a link printed on the console. Use that to visualize the

	<li><b> Using  a different Python Interpreter. </b>
		To use a more recent Python version, you must first install it on your computer; then you go through Step 3b to switch to the new 
interpreter; you will likely  need to install Bridges again for the new interpreter. The <i>Tools-->Options</i> button provides the option to choose a different python interpreter.
