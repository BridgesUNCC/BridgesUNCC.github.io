Upgrading your Bridges client is very simple.

On many systems, all you have to do is open your project on the left pane, and press `Alt-F5`.
But in case you want to take the pictoral route, simply:

- Right click your project and select `Maven > Update Project`.
- In the dialog, tick the option to `Force Update of Snapshots/Releases`.
