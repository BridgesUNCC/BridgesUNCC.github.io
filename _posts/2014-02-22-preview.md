![Diagram of a large dataset visualized](/huge_followers.png)

This is an example of an assignment. While still very rough in appearance it shows how a large dataset of followers could be visualized. The links represent connections between followers.

This example shows the server requesting data on the client's behalf. This data was manipulated into a graph data structure in Eclipse via a plugin to the client. After being manipulated it was sent to the server where it was visualized. The image shows a screenshot of the browser display.
