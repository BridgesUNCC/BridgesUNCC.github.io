# What is Bridges?

Bridges is a set of libraries that allow the user to build data structures using the building blocks from the Bridges Elements class.

Bridges currently supports the following types of Elements:

*   Single Linked Elements - elements that only point to one other element
*   Double Linked Elements - elements that point to two other element
*   Tree Elements - elements that only point to a left and right child element
*   BST Elements - a tree element with a "key", to be used in binary search implementations
*   Array Elements - elements designed to be used in array structures
*   GraphAdjMatrix - containers designed to be used as graphs
*   GraphListMatrix - containers designed to be used as graphs

Bridges also contains a visualization server that allows the user to send their code and see the data structure that they have built. The user can change the size, shape, color, and opacity of the elements in the visualization.


## What is an Element<E>?

`Element<E>` is the superclass of `SLelement<E>`, `DLelement<E>`, `TreeElement<E>`, and `ArrayElement<E>`.

![](/img/posts/faq/ClassStructure.png)

You will normally be using these classes to build data structures. Since they are subclasses of `Element<E>`, they inherit a common set of methods and instance variables, so to a certain extent they will share a common set of behavior. However, since they are all different classes, they will have methods and instance variables that are unique to their particular class.

## What about Graphs and Arrays?

Bridges also contains classes for `ArrayOfElements`, `GraphAdjacencyList`, and `GraphAdjacencyMatrix`, however, these do not subclass from the `Element` class. This is because Graphs and Arrays themselves are containers that hold Bridges classes. Internally, Bridges graphs and arrays will hold subclasses of Element. When you interact with the graphs and arrays, you will typically be adding an Element to them or retrieving an Element from them.

## What is the `<E>`?

`<E>` is the Java generic parameter. It represents any class, so you can have an `SLelement<String>` or an `SLelement<Integer>` or any other class. You may be wondering, if `<E>` can be any class, then how does Element know how to behave since a Boolean does not have the same methods available as a String? Since we didn’t put any restrictions on `<E>` inside the Element class signature, we can only call methods of `<E>` that are common to ALL java objects. We will not be allowed to call a method on E that is particular to any one class. In this way, we can allow the `Element<E>` class to function as a container. The container doesn't care what it's holding, and whatever the container is holding doesn't influence the behavior of the container.

## How does the `SLelement<E>` work?

`SLelement<E>` stands for Singly Linked Element and is a type of container that only has one pointer which points to another `SLelement<E>`. So an `SLelement<E>` "knows" who it's pointing at but it does not know who pointed at it.

![](/img/posts/faq/SLelement.png)

In this case `SLelement1` points to `SLelement2`. Calling `getNext()` on `SLelement1` will return `SLelement2`, and calling `getNext()` on `SLelement2` will return `SLelement3`. In this example, `SLelement3` is not pointing to another SLelement so calling `getNext()` on `SLelement3` will return Null. This is desirable since you will know that you’ve reached the end of all of the linked SLelements when one of them returns Null. Notice that there is no `getPrev()`. `SLelement2` has no idea what element came before it. So, you CANNOT go backwards.

### Example

```java
// create the Bridges object
// note, you need to replace "yourAPIKey" and "yourUserID"
// with the information you received from the Bridges website when you created an account

Bridges bridges = new Bridges(1, "yourAPIKey", "yourUserID");

// create a linked list stack
SLelement el0 = new SLelement("0", new Tweet("0"));
SLelement el1 = new SLelement("1", new Tweet("1"));
SLelement el2 = new SLelement("2", new Tweet("2"));
SLelement el3 = new SLelement("3", new Tweet("3"));

// set the "next" pointer to link
the elements together into a list
el0.setNext(el1);
el1.setNext(el2);
el2.setNext(el3);

// change the color of the edge from el0 to edge el1
el0.getLinkVisualizer(el1).setColor("red");

// change the color of the edge from el1 to edge el2
el1.getLinkVisualizer(el2).setColor("blue");

// change the color of the edge from el2 to edge el3
el2.getLinkVisualizer(el3).setColor("cyan");

// change the color of the el0 vertex
el0.getVisualizer().setColor("red");

// pass the head of list to bridges
to set the visualization
bridges.setDataStructure(el0);

// this command sends your list to the bridges server to visualize
// after it's accepted, you should see the web address in the console

bridges.visualize();
```

#### Results

When you run your code, you should see a similar message output to the console:

```
Check out your visuals at http:// bridges-cs.herokuapp.com/assignments/1.00/yourUserID?apikey=yourAPIKey
```

So, now you can go to the website and see the following visualization:

If you mouse over the vertices, you can see the labels.

## How does the `DLelement<E>` work?

`DLelement<E>` stands for Doubly Linked Element, and is a type of container that has two pointers that point to other `DLelement<E>`. So a `DLelement<E>` “knows” who it’s pointing at, AND it knows who pointed at it.

![](/img/posts/faq/DLelement.png)

In this example, calling `getNext()` on `DLelement2` will return `DLelement3`. Calling getPrev() on `DLelement2` will return DLelement1. `DLelement3` does not have a next pointer pointing to another DLelement so calling `getNext()` on `DLelement3` will return `null`, indicating the end of the linked elements. Since `DLelement<E>` have a `getPrev()` method, they can move forwards AND backwards through the linked elements.

### Example
```java
// create the Bridges object
// note, you need to replace "yourAPIKey" and "yourUserID"
// with the information you received from the Bridges website when you created an account

Bridges bridges = new Bridges(1, "yourAPIKey", "yourUserID");

// create a linked list stack
DLelement el0 = new DLelement("0", new Tweet("0"));
DLelement el1 = new DLelement("1", new Tweet("1"));
DLelement el2 = new DLelement("2", new Tweet("2"));
DLelement el3 = new DLelement("3", new Tweet("3"));

// set the "next" and previous pointers
// to link the elements together into a list
el0.setNext(el1);
el1.setNext(el2);
el2.setNext(el3);
el1.setPrev(el0);
el2.setPrev(el1);
el3.setPrev(el2);

// change the color and opacity of the el0 vertex
el0.getVisualizer().setColor("red");
el0.getVisualizer().setOpacity(0.5);

// change the color and thickness of the various edges
el0.getLinkVisualizer(el1).setColor("green");
el1.getLinkVisualizer(el2).setColor("red");
el2.getLinkVisualizer(el3).setColor("turquoise");
el3.getLinkVisualizer(el2).setColor("magenta");
el3.getLinkVisualizer(el2).setThickness(10.0);
el2.getLinkVisualizer(el1).setColor("blue");
el2.getLinkVisualizer(el1).setThickness(10.0);
el1.getLinkVisualizer(el0).setColor("red");
el1.getLinkVisualizer(el0).setThickness(10.0);

// pass the head of list to bridges to set the visualization
bridges.setDataStructure(el0);

// this command sends your list to the bridges server to visualize
// after it's accepted, you should see the web address in the console
bridges.visualize();
```

```

If you mouse over the vertices, you can see the labels.

## How does the `TreeElement<E>` work?

`TreeElement<E>` is another type of container that has two pointers that point to two child `TreeElement<E>`. By convention, these two pointers are called "left" and "right and the top of the tree is referred to as the "root".

![](/img/posts/faq/TreeElement.png)

By convention, the “top” of the tree is called the root. Root has two pointers, so calling `Root.getLeft()` will return the `TreeElement` `T1` and calling `Root.getRight()` will return the `TreeElement` `T2`. Note that there is no pointer from `T1` or any other element back to its root.

### Example

```java
// create the Bridges object
// note, you need to replace "yourAPIKey" and "yourUserID"
// with the information you received from the Bridges website when you created an account

Bridges bridges = new Bridges(1, "yourAPIKey", "yourUserID");

// create tree elements
TreeElement root = new TreeElement("root", "root");
TreeElement t1 = new TreeElement("t1", "t1");

// assign left/right children
root.setLeft(t1);
root.setRight(new TreeElement("t2", "t2"));
t1.setLeft(new TreeElement("t3", "t3"));
t1.setRight(new TreeElement("t4", "t4"));

// pass the root of the tree to bridges
to set the visualization
bridges.setDataStructure(root);

// this command sends your list to the
bridges server to visualize

after it's accepted, you should see the web address in
the console
bridges.visualize();
```

#### Results

When you run your code, you should see a similar message output to the console:

```
Check out your visuals at http:// bridges-cs.herokuapp.com/assignments/1.00/yourUserID?apikey=yourAPIKey
```

So, now you can go to the website and see the following visualization:

If you mouse over the vertices, you can see the labels.

## How does a `TreeElement<E>` differ from a `DLelement<E>`?

`DLelement<E>` also has two pointers, but one points to the previous element. `TreeElement<E>` does not point to the previous element, but points at two different children. `DLelement<E>` has a next and previous element, by convention, a `TreeElement<E>` has a right and left element. Generally a `TreeElement<E>` will be used in a recursive data structure and that data structure that will specify a particular relationship that all of the right elements have relative to it’s root and a different relationship that all left elements have relative to it’s root (a binary search tree, for example).

## How does the `BSTElement<E>` work?

`BSTElement<E>` is another type of container that has two pointers that point to two child `BSTElement<E>`. By convention, these two pointers are called "left" and "right", and the top of the tree is called the "root". At this point, you may be wondering how a `BSTElement<E>` differs from a regular `TreeElement<E>`. The fundamental difference between the two classes is that the `BSTElement<E>` holds an additional piece of data called the "key". The key is used to enforce a logical ordering on the tree structure independent of the element that is being held. A typical example would be a binary search tree where all of the keys of the left child are smaller than the keys of the right child.

![](/img/posts/faq/BSTElement.png)

Notice that the key for `BST1` is smaller than the key for the root so it's to the left of the root. Also notice that the key for `BST3` is smaller than the key for BST2, but larger than the key for the root. So `BST3` sits on the left child of `BST2`, but in the right child of the root.

## How does the ArrayElement<E> work?

`ArrayElement<E>` is a building block for an array of elements. It has NO POINTERS to other objects. Unlike all of the other elements, it is designed to enable direct access to a particular element at a particular index.

![](/img/posts/faq/ArrayElement.png)

In this case once you’ve made an array of ArrayElements, you get access to the element by using the index, just like a normal Java array. For example `myArray[2]` would return `ArrayElement2`

### Example

```java
// create the Bridges object
// note, you need to replace "yourAPIKey" and "yourUserID"
// with the information you received from the Bridges website when you created an account
Bridges bridges = new Bridges(1, "yourAPIKey", "yourUserID");

// create an array of 10 objects
Element[] myArray = (Element[]) new Element[10];

// use a loop to make 10 new elements and put them in thearray
for (int k = 0; k < 10; k++)

myArray[k] = new Element(String.valueOf(k), k*k);

// pass the head of list to bridges to set the
visualization
bridges.setDataStructure(el0);

// this command sends your list to the bridges
server to visualize

// after it's accepted, you should see the web address in the console
bridges.visualize();
```

#### Results

When you run your code, you should see a similar message output to the console:

```

```

## How do the `GraphAdjList<K, E>` and `GraphAdjMatrix work<K, E>`?

A graph is a set of vertices connected by edges. Unlike tree structures, a graph can have any number of vertices with any number of edges connecting them. In fact, a tree structure is just a special case of a graph.

![](/img/posts/faq/Graph.png)

Bridges represents graph structures in one of two ways: either using an adjacency list representation or an adjacency matrix representation. In the adjacency list representation, the GraphAdjList is holding a HashMap of vertices associated with a linked list of the adjoining vertices. In the adjacency matrix representation, the GraphAdjMatrix is mimicing a 2 dimensional array to describe which vertices are connected (due to limitations with using generics and arrays in Java, Bridges actually uses nested HashMaps). Typically, the reason to use one version over the other revolve around space versus time trade offs. Since the GraphAdjList representation uses a linked list to track neighboring nodes, searching for a particular neighbor is an O(n) operation. The GraphAdjMatrix has O(1) access to any particular neighbor, but it is essentially holding a two dimensional array. On sparse graphs, this can waste a considerable amount of space.

### GraphAdjacencyList Example

```java
// create the Bridges object
// note, you need to replace "yourAPIKey" and "yourUserID"
// with the information you received from the Bridges website when you created an account
Bridges bridges = new Bridges(1, "yourAPIKey", "yourUserID");

// create the GraphAdjMatrix object
GraphAdjList gr = new GraphAdjList<>();

// create the vertices and put them in the graph
gr.addVertex("John", "John");
gr.addVertex("Becky", "Becky");
gr.addVertex("Sam", "Sam");

// create the edges between the vertices
gr.addEdge("John", "Becky", 5);
gr.addEdge("John","Sam", 1);
gr.addEdge("Becky", "John", 1);
gr.addEdge("Becky", "Sam", 1);

// pass the graph to bridges to set the visualization
bridges.setDataStructure(gr);

// this command sends your list to the bridges server to visualize
// after it's accepted, you should see the web address in the console
bridges.visualize();
```

#### Results

When you run your code, you should see a similar message output to the console:

```

```

### GraphAdjacencyMatrix Example

// create the Bridges object
// note, you need to replace "yourAPIKey" and "yourUserID"
// with the information you received from the Bridges website when you created an account
Bridges bridges = new Bridges(1, "yourAPIKey", "yourUserID");

// create the GraphAdjMatrix object
GraphAdjMatrixString, String> gr =
new GraphAdjMatrix(10);

// create the vertices and put them in the graph
gr.addVertex("John", "John");
gr.addVertex("Becky", "Becky");
gr.addVertex("Sam", "Sam");

// create the edges between the vertices
gr.addEdge("John", "Becky", 5);
gr.addEdge("John","Sam", 1);
gr.addEdge("Becky", "John", 1);
gr.addEdge("Becky", "Sam", 1);

// pass the graph to bridges to set the visualization
bridges.setDataStructure(gr);
// this command sends your list to the bridges server to visualize

bridges.visualize();

## Changing Element visualization properties

Each Element class has an ElementVisualizer that controls how the visualization looks. You can change how an Element is visualized by interacting with that Element's ElementVisualizer. You can use the ElementVisualizer to change the size, shape, color, and opacity. See the following code examples:

```java
// create an SLelement
SLelement sle = new SLelement("A", "A");

// change the color
sle.getVisualizer().setColor("magenta");

// change the shape
sle.getVisualizer().setShape("diamond");

// change the size
sle.getVisualizer().setSize(50);

// change the opacity
sle.getVisualizer().setOpacity(.25);
```

The end result should have been to transform your Element visualization from the green circle on the left to the big pink diamond on the right.

![](/img/posts/faq/changedVertex.png)

## Changing Edge visualization properties

Each Element class has an LinkVisualizer that controls how the edges between the nodes appear.. You can change how an edge is visualized by interacting with that Element's LinkVisualizer. You can use the ElementVisualizer to change the thickness, color, and opacity. See the following code examples:

```java
// create two SLelement
SLelement sle0 = new SLelement("A", "A");
SLelement sle1 = new SLelement("B", "B");

// change the color
sle0.getLinkVisualizer(sle1).setColor("green");

// change the size
sle0.getLinkVisualizer(sle1).setThickness(5);

// change the opacity
sle0.getLinkVisualizer(sle1).setOpacity(.25);
```

The end result should have been to transform your the edge connecting the two nodes from the original black line on the left to the faint green line on the right.
