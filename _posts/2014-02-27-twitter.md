## Setting up twitter
---

To use the server you must have a twitter application. This allows students to connect via oauth and allows us to manage their tokens.   

**You can set up a twitter application at [http://dev.twitter.com](http://dev.twitter.com)**  
[Detailed instructions](http://http://iag.me/socialmedia/how-to-create-a-twitter-app-in-8-easy-steps/)

## Setting up your callback
---

In this step we are setting up the location to which twitter will return after authenticating users. This address should be
    webpage/auth/twitter/callback

*An important point to note is that localhost is not a valid address. When testing locally use 127.0.0.1*

## Setting up your twitter keys
---

In the final step we need to get our twitter keys so that our node instance is authenticated with twitter.  

In the image below, api-key coresponds to consumer_key's in your twitterKeys.json file.
