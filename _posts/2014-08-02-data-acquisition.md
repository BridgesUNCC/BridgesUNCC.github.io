# Overview

Since data structures filled with random or consecutive integers can be boring
and in some cases insufficiently general, Bridges gives you access to a few data
sources you might find thought provoking. Currently, you can choose from:

* Twitter followers
* Actors' filmography
* Movies' cast

Many others are planned as well.

* Latest Earthquakes [from USGS](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/)
* Current Weather [from Wunderground](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/)
* Wildlife Strike Database [from the FAA] http://wildlife.faa.gov/
* General Transit Feed Specification [from Google](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference)
* Airline On-Time Statistics [from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/ot_delay/ot_delaycause1.asp)
