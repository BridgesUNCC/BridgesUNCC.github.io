	    Visit the Bridges 
	    <a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io"> main page</a> 
	    and create yourself an account by clicking the login button
	    on the top navigation bar.  Please ensure that 
            your user id is devoid of spaces, as it will be 
            used as part of the web link for your projects.
	    After creating your account, click 
	    on your profile name in the upper right corner to 
	    view your profile. Once in your profile, you will see your
	    API Key; you will need this API key later
	    in the tutorial(as well as in every BRIDGES program 
	    you write). <b>NOTE:</b> Make sure to remember 
	    your password.

	    <ul> 
		<li> At this point, you have an Ubuntu linux system on your Windows machine and you can directly work on it like any other Linux machine and run BRIDGES programs. The compiler 
is g++ and any additional needed tools can be installed using the <i>apt </i> tool. 
		<li> To use the VSCode IDE and Debugger, you will need to set up
			a project and add files to it and set up its configuration in a
			file called <i>tasks.json</i>
		<li> Use VSCode's menus to create a new project and then create
			 a file for your BRIDGES program.
		<li> Go to the <a href = "https://bridgesuncc.github.io/tutorials/SinglyLinkedList.html"> BRIDGES Tutorial Page</a> and copy  a C++ tutorial program
	into a file, for instance a singly linked list example.
		<li> Copy paste this program into your source code file.
		<li> Create a folder called <i>.vscode</i> in your project (alternately,
		the first time you hit the <i>Play</i> button, this will be created).
		<li> Add this <a href = "img/vs_code/tasks.json"> tasks.json</a> file
			in the .vscode directory
		</ul>

	<td class = "col-md-2"> <b>Step 5: Configuring VS Code</b>
	<ul> 
	<li> Your <i>tasks.json</i>, which is a JSON file, is used to build 
		the compile command that will
		be used by VS code to execute your project. You will
		need to make the following changes to run BRIDGES programs without errors
	<li> Take a look at that file using a text editor. Make sure your compile 
	command is set to <i>/usr/bin/g++</i>
	<li> Next look at the <i>args</i> variable, containing a number of 
		options. It is a sequence of option flags and its corresponding values.
		You will need to modify two of the arguments that pertains to your
		BRIDGES installation:
	<li> <i> -I </i> argument is the path to your BRIDGES include files;
		modify this path to where you placed your BRIDGES source files and
		point to its <i>include</i> folder
	<li> <i> -L </i> argument is the path to your BRIDGES library;
		modify this path to where you placed your BRIDGES source files and
		point to its <i>lib</i> folder
	</ul>
	<li> You should not  have to change any other option.
