	<h2>Binary Search Tree Tutorial</h2>

	
	<p>
      This tutorial will illustrate the use of Binary Search Trees in BRIDGES.
	  BRIDGES supports hierarchy of tree elements, such general trees with
	  arbitrary number of children, binary trees, AVL and K-D trees.
	  Check the TreeElement class to see the full hierarchy. The BSTElement
	  which denotes a node of the binary search tree is inherited from 
	  Element and has two generic parameters, one for the 
	<strong>Key</strong>, which must be an orderable type and a second 
	parameter, E,  to  hold application specific data.
	</p>
	<p>
      BSTElement&lt;K,E&gt; is a container that has two links that point
      to two child BSTElements. It uses the same conventions as the
      TreeElement&ltE&gt;.
	</p>
	<p>
      You might wonder how a BSTElement&lt;K,E&gt; differs from a
      regular Binary Tree Element. The fundamental difference between the 
	  two classes
      is that the BSTElement&lt;K,E&gt; is used to build <i>search trees</i>,
      and holds an additional piece of data, the generic parameter K,
      called the "key".  The key is used to enforce an ordering on the tree
      structure independent of the element that is being held.
      <br><br>
      A typical example would be a binary search tree where all of the keys of
      the left child are smaller than the keys of the right child.
      <br/><br/><img width="600em" src="./images/BSTElement.png"/><br/><br/>
      Notice that the key for BST1 is smaller than the key for the root so it's to
      the left of the root. Also notice that the key for BST3 is smaller than
      the key for BST2, but larger than the key for the root. So BST3 sits on
      the left subtree of BST2, but in the right subtree of the Root.
    </p>


	<p>
	This tutorial consists of 3 parts:
	  <ol>
	    <li> A basic tutorial on how to create manually a small binary search
			tree and  visualize it</li>
	    <li> How to style the binary search tree with visual attributes </li>
	    <li> Advanced: how to build a binary search tree automatically using
				an insertion function</li>
	  </ol>

	<h2>1. Getting Started: Build a Barebones Binary Search Tree</h2>
	
	<p> In the first part of the tutorial, we will create a set of BSTElement
		nodes with some labels, , provide BRIDGES a handle to the
		data structure and visualize the array.

	  Here is the code for this part.
	</p>
	
	<div class="tabs">
	  <div onclick="displayCode('Java1',this)">Java</div>
	  <div onclick="displayCode('C++1',this)">C++</div>
	  <div onclick="displayCode('Python1',this)">Python</div>
	</div>

	<div class="tabContents">
	  <div id="Java1" w3-include-html="./Java_BST_Basic.html"></div>
	  <div id="C++1"  w3-include-html="./Cpp_BST_Basic.html"></div>
	  <div id="Python1"  w3-include-html="./Python_BST_Basic.html"></div>
	</div>

	<p>Make sure that you can run the basic tutorial.</p>
	
	<p>
	If you follow the URL given to you when the application runs, it
	will get to to the Bridges webpage that shows your output. 
	You do not need to be logged into your BRIDGES account to see the 
	output. If you are logged into your account, the output will show 
	up in your gallery.
	</p> 

	<h2>2. What Visual Attributes are supported for Binary Search Trees?</h2>

	<p> The binary search tree  you created in the first part of the 
		tutorial uses
		default attributes and is pretty boring, but it gives you the
		basic structure of a BRIDGES program.</p>

	<p> Next, we will style the binary search tree  we just created. For
		trees,  , you can
		set the <strong>shape, color, opacity and label</strong> of the tree 
		nodes, and <strong> color, thickness,  opacity and label</strong> for 
		the links.  Check out the Bridges 'Element' and 'Color' 
		classes that supports these attributes and also details the possible
		colors you can use and how to specify them. 
	</p>

	<p>The following code styles the binary search tree we created in part 1 
		and adds visual attributes.
	</p>

	<div class="tabs">
	  <div onclick="displayCode('Java2',this)">Java</div>
	  <div onclick="displayCode('C++2',this)" >C++</div>
	  <div onclick="displayCode('Python2',this)" >Python</div>
	</div>
	<div class="tabContents">
	  <div id="Java2" w3-include-html="./Java_BST_Styling.html"></div>
	  <div id="C++2"  w3-include-html="./Cpp_BST_Styling.html"></div>
	  <div id="Python2"  w3-include-html="./Python_BST_Styling.html"></div>
	</div>

	<h2>3. Advanced Features.</h2>

	<p> In the last part of this tutorial, we illustrate a search algorithm
		to find a specific value in the binary search tree. We also 
		illustrate how the tree can be styled to show the nodes visited
		and the path taken by the search algorithm

	</p>
	<p>The following code illustrates the search algorithm in a binary search tree
	</p>

	<div class="tabs">
	  <div onclick="displayCode('Java3',this)">Java</div>
	  <div onclick="displayCode('C++3',this)" >C++</div>
	  <div onclick="displayCode('Python3',this)" >Python</div>
	</div>
	<div class="tabContents">
	  <div id="Java3" w3-include-html="./Java_BST_Advanced.html"></div>
	  <div id="C++3"  w3-include-html="./Cpp_BST_Advanced.html"></div>
	  <div id="Python3"  w3-include-html="./Python_BST_Advanced.html"></div>
	</div>

        <h3>Bridges Visualization</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Once all your code is in order, run your program.</li>
          <li>Assuming all your code is correct and it compiles correctly, a link to the Bridges website will be generated.</li>
          <li>Copy/paste this link into your favorite browser to view a visualization of the data structure you’ve just created.</li>
          <li>It should look something like this:</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="iframe-wrapper">
          <iframe src="https://bridges-cs.herokuapp.com/assignments/9220/bridges_public" scrolling="no">
        <p>Sorry, your browser doesn't seem to support iframes -
          <a href="https://bridges-cs.herokuapp.com/assignments/9220/bridges_public">Frame Link</a>
        </p>
          </iframe>
        </div>

        <p>Well done! You’ve just created your Bridges Binary Search Tree project!</p>
