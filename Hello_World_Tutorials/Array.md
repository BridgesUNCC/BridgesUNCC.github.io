Array<E> implements an _arrays_ in BRIDGES, and it can be used to create arrays of any generic type; Bridges Arrays support uptto 3 dimensions. The setDimensions() method is used to set the array dimensions, which also allocates storage. Bridges creates arrays of Element<E>, which can be used to set visual properties.

  ## Bridges Visualization

  -   Once all your code is in order, run your file.
  -   Assuming all your code is correct and it compiles correctly, a link to the Bridges website will be generated on the console.
  -   Copy/paste this link into your favorite browser to view a visualization of the data structure you just created.
  -   It should look something like this:

  <p>Sorry, your browser doesn't seem to support iframes - <a href="/assignments/100/bridges_public" scrolling="no">Frame0 Link</a> </p>

  <p>Sorry, your browser doesn't seem to support iframes - <a href="/assignments/1/bridges_public" scrolling="no">Frame1 Link</a> </p>

  <p>Sorry, your browser doesn't seem to support iframes - <a href="/assignments/102/bridges_public" scrolling="no">Frame1 Link</a> </p>

  Well done! Youâ€™ve just created your Bridges Singly Linked List project!
