<h2> Example Details</h2>
<ul>
<li> We will illustrate a kd tree tree example that builds a 3 level tree.
	The partitioners are the keys in the tree. Click on the label button to
	see the partitioning dimension (X or Y).
<li> With the ColorGrid structure, we can represent the the spatial regions of the KD-tree as an 
	image (2D tree); this can be used to represent shapes using a tree representaion.
</ul>
