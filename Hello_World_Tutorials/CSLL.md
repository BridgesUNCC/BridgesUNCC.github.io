CircSLelement<E> implements a _circular singly linked list_ element in BRIDGES and is inherited from SElement<E>

  ## How does the CircSLelement<E> work?

  CircSLelement<E> stands for Circular Singly Linked Element and is a type of container that has one link, pointing to another SLelement<E>. So an CircSLelement<E> "knows" who it is pointing at but it does not know who is pointing at it(if any).

  In the above example, CircSLelement1 points to CircSLelement2. Calling getNext() on CircSLelement1 will return a link to CircSLelement2, and calling getNext() on CircSLelement2 will return a link to SLelement3. CircSLelement3 points to CircSLelement1. Calling getNext() on CircSLelement3 will return a link to CircSLelement1.

  Also notice that there is no getPrev(). CircSLelement2 has no idea what element came before it. So, you CANNOT go backwards.

  ### Bridges Visualization

  -   Once all your code is in order, run your file.
  -   Assuming all your code is correct and it compiles correctly, a link to the Bridges website will be generated on the console.
  -   Copy/paste this link into your favorite browser to view a visualization of the data structure you just created.
  -   It should look something like this:

  <p>Sorry, your browser doesn't seem to support iframes - <a href="/assignments/105/bridges_public">Frame Link</a> </p>

  Well done! Youâ€™ve just created your Bridges Circular Singly Linked List project!
