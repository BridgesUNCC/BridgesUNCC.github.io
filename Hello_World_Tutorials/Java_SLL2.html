<h2>Elements of a BRIDGES Program</h2>
<ul>
  <li> <b> Imports:</b>  This will usually include the BRIDGES data structure
		specific header files, classes related to the example, and other
		utility classes.
  <li> <b> BRIDGES Initialization, Credentials:</b>  This is typically done
		<b>once</b> at the beginning of the application. Credentials include
		your user id and application authentication id (available via your 
		BRIDGES login).
	<li> <b> Populating the Data Structure:</b> This involves building
		the data structure, as well as including application specific information
		(handled by generic variables that is part of each BRIDGES data 
		structure).
	<li> <b> Adding Visual Attributes. </b> This is done through the 
		<it>ElementVisualizer</it> (for nodes) and <it>LinkVisualizer</it> 
		(for links) classes and supports attributes such size, shape, 
		thickness, color and opacity.
	<li> <b> Specifying data structure to BRIDGES, visualization.</b> 
		The calls bridges.setDataStructure() and bridges.visualize() specifies 
		the data structure handle to BRIDGES for visualization. Multiple calls
		to visualize() will result in multiple visualizations (stacked one below
		the other). Multiple calls to setDataStructure() make sense when the 
		the data structure is changing during an application and the user wants
		to visualize its state (for instance sorting application to see the 
		state of the list after each insertion or exchange, stack pops/pushes, 
		etc).
</ul>
<h2> Example Details</h2>
</ul>
<li> In this example, we will build and visualize a singly linked list with 
student information data, specified through the StudentInfo class, which will
be part of the SLelement object through its generic variable (SLelement&lt;StudentInfo&gt;. 
<li>The elements are linked, visual attributes assigned through application data
and visualized.
</ul>
We need to include these Bridges files to give access to all the classes/methods needed to interact with Bridges</li>
  <li>In your .java file, enter the following code snippets:</li>
	<pre class="prettyprint">
      import bridges.connect.Bridges;
      import bridges.base.SLelement;
	</pre>
</ul>
<h2>Here's the final code:</h2>

<div class="panel-heading">
        <ul class="nav nav-tabs">
            <li class="active"><a href="#java_tab1" data-toggle="tab">sllist.java</a></li>
            <li><a href="#java_tab2" data-toggle="tab">StudentInfo.java</a></li> </a> </li>
        </ul>
