TreeElement<E> implements a generalized _tree element_ in BRIDGES and is inherited from Element<E>

## How does the TreeElement<E> work?

TreeElement<E> is a superclass for tree structures and can represent tree structures with arbitrary number of children at each node. The top node of the tree is referred to as the "root".

In the example above, root node has 3 children, while its children has 2, 1 and 0 children respectively. The childrent of a node is accessed by by set/getChild() methods, with an index k, referring to its k'th child.

### Bridges Visualization

-   Once all your code is in order, run your program.
-   Assuming all your code is correct and it compiles correctly, a link to the Bridges website will be generated.
-   Copy/paste this link into your favorite browser to view a visualization of the data structure you’ve just created.
-   It should look something like this:

<p>Sorry, your browser doesn't seem to support iframes - <a href="/assignments/108/bridges_public">Frame Link</a> </p>

Well done! You’ve just created your Bridges Tree project!
