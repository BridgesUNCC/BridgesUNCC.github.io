<h2>What is Bridges?</h2>
<p>
The <strong>BRIDGES</strong>(<i>Bridging Real-world Infrastructure 
Designed to Goal-align, Engage, and Stimulate</i>), an NSF TUES project, 
is focused on providing 
easy-to-use interfaces to real-world internet-based information systems, 
that are exciting, engaging and commonly used by undergraduate students, 
such as social network data, scientific or engineering data.  
BRIDGES toolkit provides a set of classes(C++  and Java are supported) 
that serve as building blocks
to the common data structures (lists, tree structures, graphs) used in 
freshmen/sohpomore level computer science. BRIDGES makes it easy to (1) 
import, use and manipulate real-world data sets as part of routine student 
projects,  and (2) provides visualizations of the data structures 
constructed by the student as part of his/her project.

BRIDGES currently supports the following types of Elements:
<ul>
<li><strong>Element</strong>
	- the basic element(abstract) that just holds application specific data and supports some basic operations</li>
<li><strong>Singly Linked List Element</strong> 
	- element that points to one following element</li>
<li><strong>Doubly Linked List Element</strong> 
	- element that points to the following and previous  elements</li>
<li><strong>Circular Singly Linked List Element</strong> 
	- singly linked element that points to itself </li>
<li><strong>Circular Doubly Linked List Element</strong> 
	- doubly  linked element that points to itself </li>
<li><strong>Multilist Element</strong> 
	- Generalization of singly linked list element, that permits any element
		to be a sublist (recursively)</li>
<li><strong>Tree Element</strong> 
	- a general tree element with some number of children defined by 
	the user</li>
<li><strong>Binary Tree Element</strong> 
	- element that has 2 children, pointing to a left and right child 
	element</li>
<li><strong>Binary Search Tree Element</strong> 
	- a binary tree element with an orderable "key" value, to be used in 
		binary search tree implementations</li>
<li><strong>AVL Tree Element</strong> 
	- a binary search tree element that also maintains balance factor  and
		tree height values. </li>
<li><strong>Graph(Adjacency List) </strong> 
	- graph container that holds vertices in an array type list and 
		element connections with singly linked lists</li>
<li><strong>Graph(Adjcacency Matrix)</strong> 
	- graph container whose representation is an adjacency matrix, with 
		vertex ids	for the two dimensions, and matrix elements containing 
		a boolean(presence/absence of edge) or edge weight.</li>
</ul>
Bridges also contains a visualization component that allows the user to send 
a representation of their data structure to a server, to see the data 
structure that they have built. The user can also change various 
visualization features such as size, shape, or color of the elements and 
their links.

<h2>What is an Element&lt;E&gt;?</h2>
<p>
Element&lt;E&gt; is the abstract superclass of all BRIDGES elements, as shown
below:
<br/><br/><img width="600em" src="./images/bridges-elements-hier.png"/><br/><br/>
You will normally be using these classes to build data structures. Since 
they are subclasses of Element&lt;E&gt;, they inherit a common set of 
methods and instance variables, so to a certain extent they will 
share a common set of behaviors. However, since they are all different 
classes, they will have methods and instance variables 
that are unique to their type.
<p>

<h2>What is the &lt;E&gt;?</h2>
<p>
BRIDGES uses generic parameters(consistent with most data structures textbooks
today); &lt;E&gt; is a generic parameter. It represents any basic type or 
object(class), so you can have an SLelement&lt;string&gt; or an 
SLelement&lt;int&gt; or any other type. In particular, this facilitates 
Element to contain application specific type, for example, a record containing
a (Twittter) Tweet, Earthquake, hospital, airport  or a movie record.
<p>
You may be wondering, if &lt;E&gt; can be any type, then how does Element 
know how to behave since a boolean does not have the same methods available 
as a string?
<p>
Since we did not put any restrictions on &lt;E&gt; inside the Element 
definition, 
we can only call methods of &lt;E&gt; that are common to ALL classes. We will 
not be allowed to call a method on E that is particular to any one class. Also,
as Element&lt;E&gt; is an abstract class, users only access it indirectly 
via its subclasses.
<p>
In this way, we can allow the Element&lt;E&gt; class to function as a container. 
The container doesn't care what it's holding and whatever the container is holding 
doesn't influence the behavior of the container.

<h2>What about Graphs?</h2>
<p>
Bridges also contains the GraphAdjacencyList and GraphAdjacencyMatrix classes, 
however, these do not subclass from Element.
<br>
This is because Graphs themselves are containers, possibly holding Bridges 
elements.  When you interact with the graphs you will typically be 
adding an Element to them or retrieving an Element from them.
