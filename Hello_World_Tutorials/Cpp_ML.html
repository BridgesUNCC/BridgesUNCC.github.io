<h2> Example Details</h2>
<ul>
<li> This example illustrates construction of a simple multilist, i.e., a list
of lists
<li>  This structure can be confusing given the forced directed rendering; use
	the mouse to move nodes around to make it more legible.
<li> In the example, the multilist is built, visual attributes assigned 
and visualized.
</ul>

<h2>Here is the final code:</h2>
<pre class = "prettyprint">

<div 
<pre w3-include-html="./tutorial-source-code/Multilist/mllist.cpp" class="prettyprint"></pre>
</div>

</pre>
<script>
  w3IncludeHTML();
