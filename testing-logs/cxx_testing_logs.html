Text: Specialized cells have telomers which protect their DNA from damaging, but when cell divides, some telomer is lost and daughter cells have it less than parent cell. After some time, DNA is complitly un protected and so, cell dies. Why then stem cells can divide endlessly ?

My clinical work focuses on thrombosis and haemostasis with a special interest in women's health. I see all kinds of patients with thrombotic disorders including obstetric and cancer patients. I am passionate about women's health and helping my patients to overcome barriers to health care here in Nigeria, many of which are due to cost and/or lack of resources. I am here to answer your questions about what it is like to work as a female clinician in Nigeria. I will be here at 12 p.m. noon US ET (16 UT), AMA!

Text: If I take a big strong spring and compress it between my arms, it takes a continuous amount of energy for me to hold it there.

However if I put that same spring in a vice and use some of my energy to close the vice, it'll happily sit there closed without me needing to add extra energy to the vice.

What's the difference here? Why do I seemingly need an infinite amount of energy to hold the spring closed but the vice doesn't? Where is that energy from me going?

Text: I thought that was exclusive to mammals and maybe birds, that the [Ancient Reptilian Brains](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Triune_brain) literally had not developed the “layers” responsible for what we'd call “emotions” (allegedly, the [Limbic System](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/lymbic%20system)?). Yet, I'm finding out many anecdotal examples of reptiles being loyal or physically affectionate. I'm very confused by this.

EDIT: a poster has brought up that we may be confusing “affection,” which only mammals can do, with “imprinting,” which “simpler” brains can manage. What are the differences between the two, in practice? Can one design tests to distinguish one process from the other, on a behavioral, empirical, tangible, objective level?

Text: I've had this question stuck in my brain for a few days. We know that light pollution affects a lot of animals in myriad ways, and that artificial blue lights really screw with our time clocks and sleep, and spending time in green space has both physical and mental health benefits. 

So, if spending time in green space is something we seem to need to thrive, what about the stars themselves? A big percentage of people have never seen the Milky Way at night because it's too bright at night now. I know people who didn't know it was something you could see with the naked eye, and had almost spiritual experiences seeing a proper night sky. Maybe it's a silly question, or maybe impossible to really study separately from the impact of artificial light in general. But I am curious if anyone has looked into whether the lack of stars at night has any effects on our health?

Text: Is there some kind of concept of evolutionary permanence that I can read about?

Like, of course there's DNA: no creature will ever evolve on Earth that is not based in DNA. Right? And probably something similar, if weaker, applies to all the various crazy proteins and other stuff that makes a cell work. Like, look at how conserved photopigments are across the animal kingdom (even beyond, you can find photopigments in non-animals that might be evolutionarily related to the opsins in human and fly retinas, etc etc).

Then you can get up to bigger scales, to things like cell types. Like, will there ever be a descendant of animals that has no neurons? It seems like, since neurons first evolved, they are *stuck*. I read a paper a while back on similarities between invertebrate and vertebrate neurons, and was amazed. They even use more-or-less the same neurotransmitters (if in different roles).

Then bigger: since insects invented wings, virtually none of them have lost them (ants, sort of - and a few other very weird examples). And insects always have that exoskeleton and always will - no insect will ever evolve with an endoskeleton, right?

And how tetrapods all have this 1-arm-bone then 2-arm-bone then lots-of-bones plan for their arms and legs (since they all started as fins-on-pegs). It seems like that just will never go away (though you might lose your arms and legs, like a snake, if you have them they always follow that plan).

What do we call this phenomenon?

Text: I need to settle a debate with someone. To be clear, we are talking about your average, everyday pendulum like you'd find in a clock or by tying a washer to the end of a string, standing on earth. 

From what I've always learned, the equation T = 2π√(L/g) defines the period of a pendulum. Neither the mass of the bob nor the amplitude have any affect on the period of the pendulum, only the length of said pendulum can change the amplitude.

This person whom I'm debating is stating that with a &quot;huge change in amplitude&quot; (but didn't specify what &quot;huge change&quot; meant) the period will change. As I understand it, acceleration increases proportionally with amplitude and therefore the two cancel each other out.

When I brought that up, they said, &quot;an elliptic integral usually approximated with a series far too long for me to get into.&quot; and gave no other explanation. I have never studied this. I've asked for an explanation, but he's gone dark other than to say, &quot;it's too complicated to get into.&quot; 

So, can a &quot;huge&quot; change in amplitude change the period, and what exactly did he mean by the elliptical integral comment?

Text: I don't know a huge amount about testosterone supplementation or hyperandrogenism, but I do know that hyperandrogenism in females is usually associated with an increased risk of diabetes, obesity, and insulin resistance. 

However, as far as I can tell, those risks are not increased in the case of people, female or otherwise, taking testosterone intentionally. (For example, transgender men who use HRT, or bodybuilders who use steroids that increase testosterone.)

Why is that? Does it have something to do with the conditions that naturally cause hyperandrogenism?

Text: Something I've been thinking about. Generally, if we picture extreme heat wiping out life - we imagine the heat causing evaporation and creating a dry, lifeless desert. 

But hypothetically, if a climate was hot enough - but was still wet/humid/receiving large quantities of rainfall, could you get a &quot;desert&quot; (as in, dead/lifeless) that is still quite wet - but can't support life because of the extreme heat?

In other words, **how hot does it have to get** before plant/animal life can no longer survive **even** in the presence of large quantities of water?

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for 'X' were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;.

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field.

Text: I understand how the redox reaction works, but I can’t understand why electrons seemingly spontaneously decide to move across the wire to the cathode from the anode.

In the example of zinc and copper in an aqueous solution, it’s obvious why copper oxidizes zinc: they’re in physical contact. However in a galvanic cell they are separated by considerable distance. 

How is it that the cathode just *knows* the anode is there and current starts flowing when there’s no direct interaction between the oxidant and reductant?

Text: In this case, I am concerned only about charge rate, not data transfer rates; but I understand just enough to grasp that this also depends on USB standard level.

[ELI70:] So, consider the case where there are -four- pieces in the chain: Host, &quot;adapter&quot;, cable, device.  Example: in my (old) car, I have a little adapter that plugs into the cig lighter socket; the cable plugs into that; and my phone then charges.  (Until recently, I naïvely thought it was nothing more than a voltage converter.)

* Does EVERY piece need to be at the same level of USB standard in order to get the higher charge rate?  IOW, if the little 12V adapter is 10+ years old, it's probably USB 1.0 and can't possibly deliver 100W even if the cable and device would like it, right?
 * (If that's the case, how does one address this issue?)
* What about these household [combination wall outlets](https://www.acehardware.com/departments/lighting-and-electrical/switches-outlets-and-plugs/outlets/3496551) : What USB version / charge rate will I likely get -- even WITH a USB-C cable?

Many thanks.  Apologies if this has been asked before; I -did- search but didn't recognise anything I could understand 😉 .

Text: I mean to ask this question both in total with all factors as well as if you disregarded humans transporting earth between different areas and the rising water levels due to climate change (which I guess answers the total, but I am not sure).

What I do know is that volcanoes erupting and the lava cooling down can create new islands, so I wondered whether more earth, sand and mass eroded into the sea or more surfaced due to lava.

When disregarding the continents and only looking at all islands (including new ones) it would also be a very interesting statistic. I have for example heard that the tallest volcano of spain on Tenerife was once a lot taller, but collapsed due to not being stable enough. I would guess that this made the total area over water bigger but reduced the mass over water.

According to Wikipedia, the Quetzalcoatlus was well adapted for the ground as well as the air. It says that the Quetzalcoatlus's main diet was smaller dinosaurs that it could pluck from the ground, akin to today's stork. However, there is one sentence that really caught my eye:

&quot;Though Quetzalcoatlus, like other pterosaurs, was a quadruped when on the ground, Quetzalcoatlus and other azhdarchids have fore and hind limb proportions more similar to modern running ungulate mammals than to their smaller cousins, implying that they were uniquely suited to a terrestrial lifestyle&quot;

The mention of Quetzalcoatlus's limb structures being similar to known running animals is really fascinating to me. Could a Quetzalcoatlus give chase to a small animal on foot if it had to, galloping after it's prey like a horse?

Text: Beekeepers remove the honey from hives and bees must keep working and keep on pollinating flowers.

But I've read in another thread that wild bee hives don't slack, and once the hive is full of honey, they swarm and start a new hive with a new queen somewhere else.

Which of the two methods is better for the ecosystem? I would dare to guess that beekeept hives are better for orchards and fruit trees, as they keep a hive always nearby at full work, while wild hives are better for the wilderness as the colonies are more spread and and reach a larger area?

Also, aren't bees basically almost clones? Don't wild hives promote genetic diversity and are better posed for survival? (if not for a given hive, at least for a number of hives in the area)

This region seems to really stand out in this graph from UNAIDS. Over the last decade, the only other region with a rise in incidence was Middle East And North Africa, but it was only a 7% increase, vs +43% in Eastern Europe And Central Asia.     



[https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media\_asset/2021-global-aids-update\_en.pdf](https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/2021-global-aids-update_en.pdf)

I gathered from this document by UNAIDS that the major disease burden in this region is on IV drug users, and the main hurdles to controlling the disease are punitive laws and social stigma (p.336, 338). But why is this region handling the disease so much worse than other regions, specifically Middle East And North Africa?           

It seems that these 2 regions have similarly oppressive political climate and legislature (Table 18.2 &amp; 19.2). The minorities also appears to be similarly marginalized. And according to the document, Eastern Europe And Central Asia had more resources available than Middle East And North Africa did (\~40% vs 20% of the resource needed for achieving 2025 goals) (Fig. 18.10 &amp; 19.6).      



I understand that this is probably a complicated issue with a myriad of factors at play. And I must admit that I do not know much about the political and cultural situation of these regions. To sum up, my question is: 

&gt;What are the major impetus to the remarkably worse HIV control in Eastern Europe And Central Asia, as compared to Middle East And North Africa, despite having a seemingly similar socio-political environment and higher resource availability?

Text:  

As I understand it, rhizomous plants look like separate plants but are often more like parts of the same plant, or at least clones. And from what I understand about genetics, historically when groups of people interbreed within a small group it can exacerbate the effects of negative genetic traits.

If I were trying to create and sustain a community of plants, and they happened to be rhizomous--like a yarrow plant--would it be enough to transplant several yarrow from one area (which are probably clones) to the target area? Or would it be necessary to go to separate locations to get &quot;different&quot; yarrow plants to seed an area?

If I just plant several of the clone plants would I have &quot;Habsburg lipped&quot; plants in a few years?

And then, the seeds.   There are usually fewer than one per segment.   And when that's the case, you just have 1 in one segment, another in another, and they jut off in seemingly random angles.

Text: I just watched the new Jurassic World movie and while I understand it wasn't scientifically accurate, it made me wonder if dinosaurs actually lived in current times and reproduced, how fast would it take them?

Generally, most things on Earth have lifespans seemingly corresponding to their size.  Some flies live for days while larger animals live for years.  Of course there are exceptions, but its kind of a general rule.  Do scientists know, or can estimate, how long would, for example, a T-Rex take from egg to hatching, and from hatchling to natural end of life?  Are we talking a few decades, a hundred years, more than a hundred?  Something like the Brachiosaurus must take many decades to reach full maturity right?  If someone told me it took them 200 years to grow to that size I would not question it.

Text: The technology/strategy behind mRNA vaccines is truly remarkable, but many explanations I've read seem to skip over a crucial logical step that is the basis of my question.

Once the mRNA enters a cell and the cell begins producing the protein that the mRNA encodes for, what are the processes between this stage and the stage of the immune system interacting with it? The state of affairs at this stage is a foreign protein inside the cell and it needs to end up in the &quot;hands off the immune system&quot;. If the protein in question is say the so-called &quot;spike protein&quot; of COVID-19, how does it get outside of the cell or to the surface of the cell? 

Cells are complicated^citation ^needed and usually have many interconnected parts like proteins helping other proteins get where they need to go or to fold in a particular way. Does the inherent shape/structure of the spike protein in this case make it thermodynamically favorable to embed itself in the cell's membrane and express itself outward? Proteins don't generally just leak out of cells so my current best guess is that it's presented by the cell in some way. Assuming this is the case, does that immune system now recognize that cell as foreign and destroy it (and thus 'read' the spike protein)?

Thanks for anyone's time.

Text: I am teaching myself about the processes by which penile tumescence occurs and is maintained.  I have found that part of the process of Ca^2+ sensitization that occurs in cavernosal smooth muscle cells is by the action of Src tyrosine kinases acting on BK(Ca) receptors by phosphorylating the alpha subunits.

However, what I don't understand is how exactly that phosphorylation winds up affecting the calcium levels?  Does it activate the ion gate?  Does it hyperpolarize the surrounding membrane?  Are other chemicals like cAMP or DAG involved? I am not a biochemist and I am but a humble physicist.  The publications on the matter seem to overlook this little detail as prerequisite material, so I'm at a bit of a loss.  I see how this works in Na ion channels as well as in vascular smooth muscle cells, but those seem to be operating by a different mechanism.

Text: So I've been trying to investigate these New Age claims that say our heart is basically an EMF transmitter but didn't find any convincing proof that this is actually true.

Obviously the heart operates through all sorts of phenomena, electricity being involved as well. Where there is current, there are electromagnetic fields. So it's obvious that SOME field could be detected if we would have a sensitive enough device.

But the problem is their claims seem especially outlandish. The research linked below argues that this EMF can even be detected several feet away, which sounds a bit crazy. If the heart would've had such a strong EMF, it would've been more common knowledge in our society. I mean, maybe they are kind of right. After all, they aren't mentioning any concrete values, they just say it's 100 times stronger than the brain's field (which I also doubt).

[https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-hearts-magnetic-field-which-is-the-strongest-rhythmic-field-produced-by-the-human\_fig11\_293944391](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-hearts-magnetic-field-which-is-the-strongest-rhythmic-field-produced-by-the-human_fig11_293944391)

I first heard about this claim here: [https://youtu.be/ta4w28IlzPE?t=1410](https://youtu.be/ta4w28IlzPE?t=1410)

This man named Joe Dispenza was making a lot of sense up to the timestamp I've selected.  
When he said the heart produces something similar to a WiFi signal, 3 meters wide, that's when my &quot;quack alarm&quot; started going off.

What's your opinion? Is all of this pseudoscience or is there any truth to it?  
Do you have any research to back up these claims?

Text: Last ice age in Norhern Europe ended some ~10 000 years ago. Agriculture was developed around the same time, and the area of Fertice Crescent in Middle East is often pointed out here. In present day this area is rather dry, except the areas in Turkey and the river banks in Iran, Iraq and Egypt.

What are the estimates what kind of climate there was in those areas 10 000 years ago? They were probably much more fertile due to lower temperature. I would also guess that a large ice cap in Norhern Europe would have lowered the temperature even more, and also affected on the precipitation in the area.

How is it actually detected?

As in, the amount of virus must be  infinitesimally  small compared to the volume of sewerage. Does the virus grow/replicate to a point where it is detected easily?

So back when the space program was just starting, what was the technology they used to talk to people in space. Was it a series of broadcasting antennas around the globe? Something that has a strong enough broadcast range to pass through planetary bodies? Some kind of aimed technology like a satellite dish that could track the ship in orbit? What was the communication infrastructure they had to build and how has it changed to today?

Text: I just got done watching a video about Parting of the Waters in Moran, WY. There is a unique feature here in which a creek running along the continental divide splits and half runs to the Pacific while the other half runs to the Atlantic. The title of the video is &quot;The Creek that Flows to Two Different Oceans&quot; if anyone wants to check it out for more context.

Anyway, it got me thinking: Assuming no evaporation, absorption into the soil, or any other means of exiting the continuous flow, how long would it take a drop of water to flow from that location all the way to the Atlantic Ocean?

There are overlapping issues like estimating actual path lengths of the creeks and rivers, different flow rates that depend on precipitation and water levels, fluid dynamics, and I'm sure a bunch other stuff I'm not even thinking of. Seems like such a cool multi-disciplinary problem. Is it possible to simplify it enough to get a rough answer? I'd love to hear everyone's take!

1. Does temperature measure translational, rotational, and vibrational motion?

2. If temperature measures average kinetic energy, couldn’t it just be expressed in terms of joules?

3. Is there a strict linear relationship between energy input and change in temperature? If not, why?

4. Does particle mass affect specific heat? If not why do particles have different specific heats?

5. What is the relationship between specific heat and specific entropy? Why do they have the same units?

6. If joules and kelvin both measure energy, then is entropy dimensionless?

Text: I had heard that lemon juice makes your body alkaline, which made no sense to me, so I did some googling. I found that it was not true, as I anticipated (since your body regulates your blood's pH level), but what I couldn't find a solid conclusion for in either direction was whether or not lemon juice creates alkaline byproducts in digestion. 

I found many semi-reputable sources (https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/lemon-juice-acidic-or-alkaline for example) that seemed to agree with that, and say that while it doesn't affect your body or blood's pH level, it can make your urine more alkaline. Most of the people I'd seen refuting it where simply saying that lemon juice can't turn your body alkaline and that it's pseudoscience hogwash, rather than specifically talking to the point that it does or doesn't make alkaline byproducts during digestion.

So my question is: Does lemon juice produce alkaline byproducts during digestion and make your urine more alkaline, and if it does, what's the process that occurs to make this happen and what is happening to all the acid? Where are the extra Hydrogen ions going?

EDIT: Thanks for all the replies! Got some really good ones that answered my question with academic sources! Just wanted to note that as I mentioned, I know that your body regulates pH and that trying to turn your body or urine &quot;more alkaline&quot; doesn't have any health benefits, was just curious on this specific point of urine/alkaline byproducts because I couldn't find an explanation but saw relatively reputable sources suggest it's true.

Still, always good to include that as part of the explanation for others who may not know that it gives no health benefits.

Text: Note that I'm not talking about &quot;growing the *most*&quot; (i.e. smallest baby size to adult size ratio). I'm talking about &quot;growing the *fastest*&quot;.

As of right now, I think it's the red kangaroo.

[This](https://www.nwf.org/Magazines/National-Wildlife/2010/Worlds-Fastest-Growing-Animal) and [this](https://www.ferris.edu/card-riley-center/Kids_Corner/marsupials.htm) say a red kangaroo is 1 gram at birth, and [the red kangaroo's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_kangaroo) [states that female red kangaroos can be of reproductive age (i.e. &quot;adulthood&quot;) as soon as 18 months](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_kangaroo#Reproduction) (but [that they weigh, at most, 88 pounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_kangaroo#Description)).

Using this information, let's say the following:

1. 1 year = 12 months = 365 days
2. 18 months = 365 \* 1.5 days = 547.5 days
3. 88 pounds / 1 gram = 39,916.1286

Plugging these values into [this exponent calculator](https://www.omnicalculator.com/math/exponent) tells me that, for a female red kangaroo to grow from its birth weight to its weight at adulthood in 547.5 days, it must multiply its body weight by 1.01954x (101.954%) per day.

Alternative, reversing this, and assuming the upper bound of red kangaroo reproductive age (5 years/1825 days), and the lower bound of female red kangaroo body weight (40 pounds), that means said female red kangaroo must multiply its body weight by 1.005387x per day (100.5387%) in order to grow from 1 gram to 40 pounds in 1825 days.

**Are there any mammals** **^((not animals,)** [***^(mammals)***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal)***)*** **that grow faster than this?** Right now, I think the red kangaroo takes the cake, seemingly growing 7.1x to *\~1,170x* its body weight within a year.

Text: This question is specifically aimed at showing how asking high quantities of a population to take the vaccine stops the spread at a population level.

I would assume the following things to be relevant

1. chance of people who get infected that are vaccinated
2. chance of then infecting others, modulated by length of illness, viral load and symptoms (coughing)
3. how good the immunity is from infection + vaccine, i.e. how often vaccinated people get reinfected vs unvaccinated

Im asking this because its pretty frustrating that people always pull a specific country with high vaccination rates and high cases and then say young people getting the vaccine doesnt help others at all. I have the suspicion that their view is limited, but I would like to see evidence or more professional perspectives on the matter :)

Text: So I was reading this news article: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/15/age-of-obesity-shaming-overweight-people. 

The author seems to suggest that between 1970 and today, sugar consumption in the USA has increased 39 times, and attributes this as a major cause the obesity epidemic. He pointed out that in 1970 people consumed slightly more calories but yet were thin.

I completely cut out all sweet tasting products from my life. I still eat around the same number of calories and yet in 6 months I've lost 40lbs of weight. Even when I was dieting and in calorie deficit but still consuming sugar, I struggled to lose weight. So I think there could be something true about this, as I don't even think about dieting nowadays and yet the weight just comes off anyway.

Does anyone here know why or how added sugar specifically would lead to rapid weight gain?

Text: I was hearing people the other day claim that the accumulation of mutations caused by lower mortality rates (thus causing a wider variety of individuals with mutations to survive and reproduce) would result in an overall reduction of average human intelligence, over time.

Just wanted to get feedback from actual geneticists on that claim, as it is expounded more or less in this paper: [https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00361](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00361). I think this sounds like a load of eugenic bullshit (and that the idea of a co-ocurrence of a dysgenic trend with the Flynn effect is methodologically unsound), but I don't think I have enough knowledge of the subject to actually assert so. 

Is this a fringe theory, or is there any support for it in current genetic studies?

Text: As a Yemeni-American, I've noticed trends in how other first-gens from (loosely) similar regions and genetic backgrounds show greater susceptibility to certain diseases. 

I understand that we know, for example, that certain populations don't react well to alcohol on a genetic level, and have a greater propensity for addiction. Then, after enough generations of that, that population's gene pool has a greater physical tolerance or resistance to some of the negative effects of alcoholism. Yemen is an interesting case because many parts of it are inhabited by people who've resided there for such a long time and with so little mixing, relative to many other places.

Then of course there are the stark differences in lifestyles, and certain morphological or physiological advantages or disadvantages can become the opposite.

Do we understand more than this? I've read that genetics will require a quantum leap before we can more accurately analyze and predict disease susceptibility based on genetic markers, so I guess I'm just trying to get a read on how well we *actually* understand these topics, or even how we come to the conclusions we *can* draw.

Text: Solar panel sun tracking is why I ask. There are active trackers which use light sensors to change the angle of solar panels in order to maximize their efficiency. As an alternative if setting up a panel at a particular location, that locations position variables could be set statically and using date and time point the solar panel toward the predicted location of the sun in the sky.

I'm wondering if those functions/equations already exist.

Text: Looking at [the Wikipedia page for absorption bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_band), it seems to me that there's a sizable window - i.e. a [local minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima) \- in the graph for [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation) absorption, as per [this image](https://i.stack.imgur.com/jOhUm.png).

[Water vapor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor), [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen), [ozone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone), and [methane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane) appear to be entirely transparent to radiation of 4 μm wavelength, [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) only appears to start absorbing it *after* that point, and even [nitrous oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide) has a window there. Moreover, [Rayleigh scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering) is also minimal there.

On top of *that*, [this Earth Science Stack Exchange answer](https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/13620/does-anyone-have-absorption-coefficients-at-different-wavelengths-for-sulfur-dio/13621#13621) and [its source](https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/13620/does-anyone-have-absorption-coefficients-at-different-wavelengths-for-sulfur-dio/13621#13621) show minimal (sub-0.5%) absorbance of [sulfur dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide) at that wavelength. Why is this? It seems like a rather odd coincidence for so many things to be transparent to 4 μm (a specific wavelength of mid-wavelength infrared) EM radiation.

As a coincidence, this is one of many parts why global warming is a thing, IIRC: mid-range infrared comes in through the 4 μm gap, gets soaked up by the Earth, and later gets re-radiated at different wavelengths that *do* get soaked up by the atmosphere.

I just don't know *why* there's a 4 μm gap there.

Text: I was driving past an equestrian place the other day while there was a show happening. I drove past again the next day and all the horses were back in their fields quietly munching grass, and it got me wondering whether they had any memory of the previous day's events.

We know that animals are able to remember which plants or other animals are good to eat, and which ones are dangerous, but I wouldn't call this episodic memory. We also know that many animals can be trained to perform a certain action which they associate with a reward, but I doubt a dog is remembering what happened in training when told to sit - it's become an instinct. Conversely we know that abused dogs will exhibit fear of humans, of men, or of particular objects because of negative experiences associated with these things, but are the dogs remembering specific times that they were hurt by these things, or is it again just a learned instinct?

When we as humans recall a memory, we are to all intents and purposes experiencing a dulled down abbreviated version of the original sensory inputs that created it (although obviously the sensory neurons from the body aren't involved this time). We know that it's only a memory, but I'm wondering whether an animal would be able to make this distinction. Perhaps the horses in my introduction would become really confused as to why they were eating grass but at the same time being ridden around, hearing a crowd but at the same time not seeing one, then suddenly seeing a crowd but not hearing any noise, then chewing on grass again but at the same time feeling a bit in their mouths. Do animals possess the intelligence to distinguish memories from live experiences, or is this a reason why they can't possess episodic memory, because it would mess with their heads too much?

When we see a planet, we are seeing light reflected back at us after scattering on the planet's surface.

But I've never understood how we 'see' the CMB. If it represents the early universe before any luminous structures existed (i.e. &quot;background&quot;), and that early universe is expanding away from us, what surface sent those photons toward us? Are they just flying in every random direction? 

I suspect I am just thinking about universal expansion incorrectly, but would love some clarification. Thanks!

I'm not going to quote any sources but correct me if I get anything wrong. I did some googling and reading on Reddit, and heard that when you grow up obese, your body makes more fat cells to store fat and that number gets locked in after adolescence, or they won't be made except under extreme circumstances afterwards. Also that generally childhood obesity makes the body have a tendency / more &quot;biologically wired&quot; to store fat or more fat.

Let's say I have person A and person B. A had childhood obesity while B didn't, and both have the same stats that would be put in a TDEE calculator like [this one](https://www.freedieting.com/calorie-calculator) (sex, age, physical activity, etc.) except for weight, but if they enter in the same weight, both would get the same TDEE Result. If they both ate, let's say 2000 calories a day, would person A weight noticeably more, or they weigh about the same (and any difference would just be the result of being 2 different people)?

I am not an environmental scientist, a climate scientist, nor a resource scientist, but I do have a fairly robust understanding of our current predicament in regards to climate change. The video I’ve linked presents Russ George, who claims that based upon his research, a planet wide bloom of phytoplankton could absorb a significant percentage of the world’s carbon. I have several questions about this.

Based on what I’ve seen, his message is backed by research. However, I’m unaware whether or not it is peer reviewed, or even seriously considered by others within his field. If it were to be true, then I would imagine climate scientists would be talking about this nonstop, but I’ve only just heard about it. I can’t tell, and any clarity on whether or not his work and claims are credible would be helpful.

If it is credible, then I have several further questions. What would be the ecological ramifications of having a phytoplankton bloom on a global scale? Beyond that, how much time would it buy humanity to switch over to carbon neutral methods of energy production?

Thank you in advance for any insight into this issue.

What happened when it encountered mountains? Did the ice move like glaciers or did the sheet just add and lose ice at the edges? 

How did weather work over the ice sheet if for thousands of miles in any direction, the “ground” was a over 5,000 feet higher than the rest of the continent and surrounding oceans? Did clouds run into it and get stuck? Did they exist over it?

Text: I am a medical student and I am currently going through pulmonary physiology. I understand the concepts of diffusion and perfusion-limited gases, but there is one point in my physiology textbook which I cannot seem to understand.

When discussing DLCO, the textbook states that CO is a diffusion-limited gas. It then goes on to discuss the effects of changes in flow (Q) on DLCO and how doubling or halving flow does not impact DLCO, supporting that it is a diffusion not perfusion-limited gas. But I do not get why changing Q would not affect DLCO. Here is my take on it: Arterial CO pressure does not equilibrate with alveolar CO pressure by the end of the pulmonary capillary (i.e., diffusion-limited), but it still does rise slightly to some value lower than that of the alveoli. So wouldn’t increasing flow decrease contact time and thus cause an even lower arterial CO pressure throughout the pulmonary capillary and thus the gradient for CO diffusion would be greater than at lower flow rates? And therefore, a higher DLCO?

In support of my understanding, increased DLCO can be observed in obesity and is attributed to increased pulmonary blood flow in these patients.

Noteworthy to mention, the textbook does assume that pulmonary capillary dimensions are constant with changing flow. But still, I do not believe this would make the above reasoning false.

Thank you in advance!

Text: Urine drug tests that rely on dipsticks seem really counterintuitive. There, the presence of two bands (test + control), no matter how faint, means that the sample is **negative** for the drug tested. On the other hand, the absence of a band in the test area means the sample is **positive**. 

This is of course the 'opposite' of how COVID-antigen tests work. Moreover, if the test is detecting the drug (or a secondary metabolite) through immunocolorimetry, the way these tests work make little sense.

Could anybody explain? It'd be greatly appreciated.

Nature published this article which basically takes a look at the change in # of snips within various genetic pathways between Neolithic/Bronze Age Europeans and modern Europeans.

Certain pathways clearly lost associated SNPs while others gained some. What does this mean for these genetic pathways to have more or less associated SNPs?

Does each pathway correspond to a singular trait or set of traits?

Does having more SNPs mean these traits are expressed to a higher degree / magnitude?

For example, hsa04114 	Oocyte meiosis

Or 

hsa04740 	Olfactory transduction

And 

hsa05204 	Chemical carcinogenesis

Today, June 30, is International Asteroid Day-but at NASA, every day is asteroid day!

Asteroids are rocky, airless remnants left over from the early formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago and NASA and our partners are always looking to the skies to study these ancient time capsules. From our missions [to explore the Trojan asteroids in Jupiter's orbit](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/lucy/in-depth/) and [bring a piece of an asteroid back to Earth](https://www.nasa.gov/osiris-rex), to our [efforts to find, track and monitor asteroids](https://www.nasa.gov/specials/pdco/index.html) and other near-Earth objects to protect our planet from potential impact hazards, we're uncovering the history of our solar system while working to keep our future safe.

Ask our experts anything about what we're learning from asteroids, how we're protecting the Earth, and much more!

La NASA y sus socios miran constantemente al cielo para estudiar estas antiguas cápsulas del tiempo. Desde nuestras misiones para explorar los asteroides troyanos en la órbita de Júpiter y traer un trozo de asteroide de vuelta a la Tierra, hasta nuestros esfuerzos para encontrar, rastrear y monitorear asteroides y otros objetos cercanos a la Tierra para proteger nuestro planeta de posibles peligros de impacto, estamos descubriendo la historia de nuestro sistema solar mientras trabajamos para mantener nuestro futuro seguro.

Text: How would we know the difference? 

It seems a very important point to understand how to prevent and treat depression. The extend to which depression is being talked about almost as a purely physical ailment like a broken leg or a weak heart in modern culture has helped destigmatize it but it just makes me wonder if this is really the right way to think about it. 

Thinking about it as a syndrome seems to put the problem on the shoulders of the individual rather than their enviroment (and vice versa).

Any input would be appreciated. Maybe some neurobiological insight?

Edit: arguably this is a psychology or even philosophy question but I'm specifically interested to know if any neurobiological research has been done on this.

Text: So I read that your body generates on average 50mL of blood every day. So what happens to the old blood? Where does it go? 

So blood cells die and deteriorate just like any other type of cell, but what happens to the blood then? Do your other cells absorb the collapsed blood cells? 

I guess I'm also meaning to ask, if your circulatory system is, for the most part, a closed loop system, what happens to blood cells when they die? Where do they go? 

And, this may be the weirdest question of all, what are the long term effects of blood doping? 

So your body has roughly 10 pints of blood in it. You take out a pint and refrigerate it, then wait for your body to regenerate 1 pint worth of blood, bringing your total back up to 10. 

Then you put that first pint *back* into your body. Does your body just permanently have more blood now? Does it sense that there's more than usual and stop producing new blood until the amount returns to normal? What happens there?

Text: I'm doing some research on the effects of UV radiation on skin and found that there is not much literature on exactly how tanning oils help the skin to darken faster/better. After reading around, the common phrase I come across is that it &quot;lowers the refractive index of the skin&quot; to permit greater penetration of radiation, but what does that phrase mean??

My thought is more inclined to the tanning oil refracting light like how immersion oil in light microscopy would refract light, but what does that have to do with the refractive index of skin?

The other explanation is in the moisturizing property of the oil sustaining the substrate accumulation for the melanocytes.

\*correct me if I'm wrong\*

Text: I've read from several different sources that when a fresh injection of basaltic magma intrudes into a more silica-rich magma chamber under a volcano, some sort of reaction happens that ultimately leads to a large explosive eruption. I've specifically heard this implicated for the 19th century Krakatoa eruption, where people point to volcanic rock of varying color bands indicating partially mixed magmas that cooled preserving the different rock types. 

However, these sources don't mention a mechanism for this. Is there some sort of chemical reaction between the different magmas? Is it a physical reaction relating to different temperature/density/viscosity/gas content/something else?

What leads two bodies of relatively stable magma to generate immense pressure and explode when mixed together?

Text: I was trimming bushes when I noticed a small thorn stuck itself into my knuckle. My finger looked normal and didn't hurt, so I removed the small thorn and continued trimming. 30 seconds or so later I raise the same hand up again and noticed I had blood all over the finger, and some had dripped onto my pants. By the time I noticed this it had already stopped bleeding.

Did the thorn hit a vein or something, and removing it caused the area to bleed so much until it clotted? The area now has a bruise around a half inch in diameter.

This thorn was incredibly small, and the puncture isn't even noticeable. It's really hard for me to believe such a small &quot;injury&quot; could cause so much blood. How could that much blood escape an invisible little puncture in only 30 seconds?

I'm disappointed I didn't get to witness it.

Text: I am currently reading [The Selfish Gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene), and during one chapter he lightly touched on crossover during meiosis. I started thinking about crossover and I have a lot of questions that I can't really find the answer to. It seems like most places just touch on crossover as a step during meiosis, but don't really elaborate much. Anyway, here are my questions I hope someone can help me wrap my head around this:

* First of all: does crossover only happen (at most) once per chromosome? All diagrams look somewhat like [this](https://ib.bioninja.com.au/_Media/crossing-over_med.jpeg), which indicate that they swap only the ends. Is that the case, or are those diagrams an oversimplification and more than one &quot;pieces&quot; that are crossed over?

* If the answer to the above is yes, then I want to move onto this [meiosis diagram](https://cdn.lecturio.com/assets/Overview-of-meiosis-I-and-II-1200x1034.png). Is it true to assume then that we all likely possess entire chromosomes that came directly from our grandparents? In the diagram, each of the 4 cells has 2 chromosomes, one that's intact, and one that's crossed over. So for example, if my dad passed an &quot;intact&quot; chromosome 1 to me, there's a 1/4 chance that I'll pass that intact chromosome 1 to my son. Is that correct?

* How does crossing over work with the sex chromosomes? In the case of eggs, there's always two Xs, do those crossover? In the case of sperm, there's one X and one Y, do those crossover in anyway, or are they left alone?

* If the answer to question 1 is yes, then is there a pre-determined (approximate or accurate) length that's exchanged? If so, how is it determined? If it's random, what determines it? 

* Is the number of base pairs in an exchange the same on each side? Also, this question and the above assume it's done by number of base pairs. Is it &quot;calculated&quot; differently perhaps? Number of genes? Something else?

* Now, the question in the title: how does the process ensure that no really bad errors are introduced? If I understand correctly, it's not necessary that the two homologous chromosomes are the same length. One may have mutations the other doesn't, and vice versa. It's also likely those mutations are fine independently. But when mixed together, they could break things... so why doesn't it?

* And lastly: if question 1 is yes, has the existence of the crossover process lead to &quot;less important&quot; (or &quot;more ok to mutate) genes to be at the tips, and &quot;more important&quot; genes to be towards the middle? For example, per the question above, I imagine that eye color genes or genes that contribute to my face shape or skin color or traits like that are more &quot;ok&quot; to be mutated, where as for example, the gene for hemoglobin... you don't want to mess with that one.


Thanks for looking at my wall of text. I'm happy to restate questions if they don't make sense. Hope someone or many of you can help me with this.

Thanks again!

How do we discover what the new strand of the flu is?

How long does it take to develop a vaccine for it?

Why is this faster than other vaccines?

How do we verify that it works and is safe for patients in less than a year?

How effective is the vaccine, and if it's really effective, how is it made to be so effective year after year?

I feel like there's a &quot;How to Make a Flu Shot This Year&quot; handbook out there.

Are there any other viruses out there that we update our vaccines for so regularly? Thanks in advance!

Text: What I know is that the Poincaire group is characterised by, like, 9-10 commutation relations. And every field, before quantisation, is a vector space on which there must be representations of the Poincaire group defined as operators.

For instance, the operator e^(xd/dy-y/d/dx) is a representation of a member belonging to this group, and this operator acts on the vector space of fields, causing to rotate them. e^(d/dx) is another member of this group. Another member would be the exponentiation of Pauli matrices. Those don't operate on infinite dimensional fields, but rather on 2- component objects. Another member of this group could be 4x4 Lorentz transformations, which operate on 4 vectors. Bottom line : **every field that we quantise must have operators of this group defined on them.**

About SU1xSU2xSU3, I know that these are used as gauge groups. But idk much more than that. 

Have I understood them right? And **is there any connection between what these two groups have to do with physics?** Or are just important but independent ideas?

While when i am studying mineralogy and crystallography i see that many mineral's higher temperature polymorphs are more ordered than the low temperature. For example Akali feldspars high temperature polymorphs (Sanidine and Orthoclase) are Monoclinic in symmetry and the lower temperature polymorph (microcline) is in Triclinic symmetry.

As far as i understand monoclinic is supposed to be more ordered than triclinic. So what am i misunderstanding here? Why are these two things counter intuitive?

Text: Hey there

In general, stars are moving away from us and, in combination with the doppler effect, this gives us redshift. When we look at stars with our eyes, they look more red than they actually are. When a picture is taken, the star looks more red than it actually is. This leads to two ways to represent a star in a picture (like [this one](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NXmL6bbh7QMA3xxfuu56uZ.png)):

1. The way a star looks for a human on earth (non-colour corrected for redshift)
2. The way a star *actually* looks (colour corrected for redshift). It would display the colour of a star like the star actually sends out.

And so rises my question: are pictures of stars colour-corrected for redshift? Do the pictures display a star like a human would see it, or how it looks in reality (as if you were right next to it)?

For example, in the picture linked above, the star at the centre is just a white spot. But let's take the orange star to the left bottom of the middle. Is it actually that red (colour-corrected)? Or does it look that red because of red shift (not colour-corrected)?

In school, in dutch, I learned the term &quot;Emission spectrum&quot; of a star (almost always hydrogen is used). I think the official english term is RVS? You can use that and the default (&quot;recorded&quot; on earth) to calculate the amount of redshift. If you know how much redshift there is, you can colour-correct a picture for redshift. So if you supply a picture of a star and it's RVS, you can do some calculations and color-correct a picture. However, when searching the web, I didn't find a single &quot;tool&quot; that could do this. Why isn't there any?

I just had this topic in physics class at school and I came up with these questions after his lesson and my teacher didn't know the answer, so here I am, asking it to you people. I hope you can shed some light!

Text: I have messed around quite a bit electrolyzing materials in order to generate hydrogen, oxygen and chlorine. I had very limited means and it was just a hobby project, but a consistent problem I had and I saw others having on the internet is the corrosion of the anode. Even stainless steel or graphite could not stand the test of time and I can imagine platinum electrodes are prohibitively expensive for industrial scale. Other options such as Mixed-metal-oxide seems too expensive for gigawatt scale production as well. Most hydrogen manufacturing websites only mention marketing buzzwords (&quot;ultra high density&quot; / &quot;innovative corrosion resistance&quot;) and no technical details. Perhaps it's all a bit of a trade secret, but I am quite curious!  


Sidenote, I can imagine it getting messed up when messing with NaCl electrolysis with chlorine and carbon steel electrodes. But if I recall correctly even NaOH solutions with stainless corroded after some time. So my question focusses specifically on hydrogen production.

Text: Say some bacteria became 100% resistant to antibiotic A 20 years ago, is now 50% resistant to antibiotic B and 10% resistant to antibiotic C. Since antibiotic A is no longer effective, B and C are being administered instead. Fast-forward to 2050, the same bacteria has become resistant to B and C, and new antibiotics are being used instead. Since antibiotic A has been deprecated a while ago and the bacteria has evolved multiple times because of other antibiotics, would antibiotic A ever become a viable treatment again?

Text: Hello everyone hope you have a great day. So I just began studying the immune system and I have some questions. 
So if I understand it correctly so far, when pathogens enter the body they have to get recognized somehow, so the body can destroy them. So pathogens have these pamp (pathogen associated molecular patterns) that get recognized by the phagocytes with the help of &quot;toll like receptors&quot;. Also my textbook says something about opsonins, chemical compounds that &quot; mark&quot; the pathogens so phagocytes can recognize and destroy them. 

My questions are:
1) How did the cell evolve those toll receptors? Was it randomly but they stayed bc they are useful? Let's say you have a cell that no pathogen has ever interacted with it. So logically, the cell hasn't any receptor for it (or it has but it was a random generation-im not sure how it works). 
2) From my understanding, opsonins bind to the pathogen somehow and help the phagocyte recognize it. So opsonins have a lock-key relationship with phagocytes? It would make sense for the cell to recognize molecules that are part of the cell. But how do opsonins bind to the pathogens? My textbook isn't going on detail. 

Thank you for reading so far and sorry if my questions are stupid. Also sorry for any grammar or spelling mistakes, English isn't my first language.

Text: Recently there was a heavy downpour and I was told that the nearby library had to freeze dry books/papers in their magazine. Apparently, there had been a small water leak and parts of their inventory got wet.

I have then been searching online, how the process of freeze drying actually works and found several sources. However, while reading I began wondering: These processes usually create ice crystal inside the material they want to dry. How does paper survive this process?

I can imagine, that the paper isn't too rigid, it can bend and deform given pressure unlike cell walls. Cell walls seem to be rather fragile as ice crystals can break them. However, if paper had been completely drenched/soaked in water, I would expect at least some damage to the paper. But apparently, freeze drying seems to be a very safe method, why is that?

Text: I was reading earlier today about the kinds of ailments that bone marrow transplants are used to treat (as I am thinking about signing up on the registry to donate), and I noted that in the case of leukaemia, chemotherapy or radiotherapy is used to completely destroy the recipient's immune system first.

However, whilst relatively good, there are still figures that suggest that survivability over the years following treatment is not always that high, some still slip through the gaps.

But what causes these deaths after transplants over a long time since the procedure? Do the recipients somehow reject and attack the donated marrow? Does the new marrow eventually fail? But the recipient's immune system was destroyed, why can't the received marrow/immune system exist indefinitely, or a repeat/follow-up transplant procedure performed further down the line?

A follow-up question I have is are there grounds for marrow transplants to be used to treat immunodeficiency disorders such as CVID? I also read that some investigation has been performed into treating MS with bone marrow transplantation.

This is a long one, thanks in advance!

But that doesn't make the intensities at other wavelengths zero... They are there, non zero but small... I suspect they appear due to scattering from no so tightly bounded electrons. 

But my question is why should they be so low? Like why is the concentration of free electron scattering and tight electron scattering so high compared to the rest(the no so tight electron scattering)...?

Text: The way I understand it, vaccines use a dead, or weakened, virus. Some vaccines use only parts of a virus (or bacteria). And in the case of the Covid vaccines, they use mRNA technology. 

Now, the way I understand it, once this is introduced into the body, the immune system reacts and neutralizes the antigen. So, when the antigen enters the body a second time, the immune system reacts much quicker. I also understand that microbes can mutate, which has an effect on the vaccine's potency. This is why we have to get a flu shot every year, because the virus mutates. 

However, in the cases of Smallpox and Polio, we have managed to eradicate these diseases by way of vaccines. So, my question is it possible that, with vaccines, we were able to eliminate some diseases with vaccines, but not others? Did these other viruses just not have a chance to mutate? How would we get to the point where we don't let the flu or Covid to mutate? 

Please no &quot;Big Pharma&quot; conspiracies. I just want to know people's thoughts from a scientific standpoint. Thanks.

I've recently become aware of the dangers of BPA (Bisphenol A), as well as BPS (Bisphenol S) (which is not flagged equally but considered just as dangerous) as endocrine disruptors and carcinogens. I've learned that it is strongly recommended to replace plastic when it comes to food containers. However, I have a few questions about the use of plastics in every day life that I have found opposing answers for when searching and I'd appreciate your take on:

1. Are plastic containers relatively safe (with or without BPA) as long as they're not used to heat up food? Is not using them for storing food in the fridge or at room temperature still highly recommended or are the risks exaggerated?
2. Do plastic containers/trays/storage bins (with or without BPA) for clothes, personal items, and paper pose similar risks? Should plastic be avoided to store and organize items in desks, closets, shelfs, etc, too?
3. Do the risks of doing 1 and 2 increase for a person with actual hormone problems?

Or does it perhaps get absorbed directly through the skin?

Text: My brother is training to be a fighter pilot and his training requires him to go through simulations that expose him to upwards of +7.5 Gs. My questions regards the risk of RV/LV hypertrophy due to the alterations in cardiac preload and afterlife from being under these Gs. 

I currently work as a scribe in pediatric cardiomyopathy and see a lot of HCM, and knowing the pathology of ventricular hypertrophy got me wondering if there was a risk on RV or LV hypertrophy in fighter pilots due to chronic exposure due intense +Gs

I read one study from Israeli fighter pilots that found no difference in cardiac dimensions by echocardiography when comparing pilots exposed to +Gs vs. -Gs (compared over a 5 year period). However are there studies that compare cardiac dimensions and functions of pilots to the baseline population not exposed to these type of G forces?

Text: Hopefully my question is alright! I hope I can get some answers. Lately I've been finding dead baby birds all over my backyard, and I hadn't a clue what was killing them. This morning I heard a terrible commotion and found five squirrels circling an adult collared dove like a pack of wolves. They took turns jumping on her back and attacking her. Then, later, the same squirrels started attacking one another! One seemingly nearly killed the other one - By the end of the fight it was hanging off of a tree branch, mouth open, clearly exhausted. It wasn't even holding onto the branch. Is this normal behavior for squirrels? What's the science behind this behavior? I've never seen it before!

Text: I've been watching prof. Michael Levin's work in regenerative biology and morphology, where he is working on how cells build bodies. He states that DNA contains no information related to a multicellular organism's three dimensional anatomy. 

Timestamped explanation.

[https://youtu.be/ZmRaIQOlxTY?t=654](https://youtu.be/ZmRaIQOlxTY?t=654)

&amp;#x200B;

But everything I see online, and everyone I ask online explicitly states that DNA tells cells how to build bodies. 

&amp;#x200B;

If Levin is wrong, and DNA does contain anatomical information, are we able to learn the anatomy of an animal, or even a simple plant *just* by reading the genome? Obviously without comparing it to a related organism.

Does it have something to do with the lack of proper oxygenated blood?

Edit: For clarity, by &quot;animal in every-day talk&quot; I just mean no single celled organisms, bacteria, etc. Things that are just so obviously far from us because they're so simple. Things like insects, sponges, etc all count. I eliminate them simply because while most likely correct, it's just not an interesting answer, and most people not in the scientific field wouldn't consider a bacteria to even be an animal in any way.

Text: Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I have been learning about Piaget recently through the Introduction to Psychology Yale course ([https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6A08EB4EEFF3E91F](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6A08EB4EEFF3E91F)) and I was wondering if it would be possible, maybe through a set of tailored puzzles, to accelerate a child's advancement through Piaget's developmental stages.

 

\- Is there a physical limit for this (possibly that children gain these abilities not only through assimilation with their environment but also the physical growth of brain, therefore such puzzles/toys would not be effective as the child does not have the physical brain capacity to advance in their developmental stage yet?)

&amp;#x200B;

Any studies/videos regarding this topic would be greatly appreciated, let me know what you all think.

Text: *Observations:

Every time I trim my body hair, it grows back.

Now there can be two possible explanations for this:

*Explanation 1:

Body hair growth is continuous and hair grows indefinitely long if left ungroomed.

But I know this is not true, because for the first 18 years of my ife I never trimmed any hair, but they still didn't grow further after reaching a certain size.

*Explation 2:

There is some sort of feedback mechanism that let's the hair root cells know that the hair has been trimmed and they grow enough to compensate for the exact length that has been lost.

*Question:

But if hair is made of dead cells, how exactly can the body tell if that particular strand of hair has been cut

(I tried cutting out a patch of hair for this purpose and it grew to the same length as well after a few weeks)

And the exact length to which it has been cut?

....

I specifically put body hair in my question because I've never tested our the full limit of head hair, so I assumed it grows indefinitely.

Original Antigenic sin is a concern for me.

So my question is, of all the other available surface epitopes of the virus, how much mutation has been going on there? I would wager that the Spike protein faces the most evolutionary pressure right now with the amount of vaccinated people. Are other surface antigens as variable?

Text: How does our immune system transfer genetic information about identified viruses and bacteria to future generations of white blood cells and other immune system functions? Does it get transferred, and if so, how can we develop a persistent immunity to something like polio?

How are white blood cells recycled by the body? Does the genetic data coded by these WBCs get lost? 

It is my understanding that WBCs encode some of the genetic material it breaks down to help identify future threats, but WBCs don't live forever, so what happens to this captured genetic material?

Text: So I know in a camera that there's a bayer filter that makes color out of a black and white photograph, but for the JWST, it works in near infrared. Some news articles seem to say that it is able to un-red shift images from near infrared, but I assume, since it requires interpolation, that the JWST works in black and white and doesn't have a near infrared bayer filter equivalent. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is by what process is a color image generated from near infrared light? If it requires multiple types of wavelengths, how is that collected because I thought that it was a &quot;black and white&quot; camera sensitive to all unfiltered wavelengths equally

Text: A friend and I were arguing about the color of a car. I said it was pink. He said it was purple. I'm not a native speaker of English, so I wondered if that had perhaps something to do with it - perhaps my mother tongue delimited pink and purple differently than English. But asking some Americans, I found out that actually the jury was split. This got me thinking...  


\- Are some color boundaries fuzzier / more ambiguous than others? For instance, yellow might not be as contentious a color as others, but that is just my impression. 

  
\- If some color boundaries are fuzzier than others, is that consistent across languages? For instance, is the boundary between green and blue always fuzzy?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Are there any biological bases for color definitions, anchored perhaps in color perception and processing?  


I realize that this question straddles many disciplines, so I flaired it with Psychology but it could as well have been linguistic, anthropological etc.

However, I can't help but feel like some galaxies are (sometimes heavily) distorted - just like a long exposure shot that was taken with my DSLR. Meanwhile, other galaxies (that seem to be close to the distorted ones) look crisp. 

Am I seeing it wrong? Are these galaxies distorted by gravitational (or other?) effects?

Text: There are multiple arcs of light spreading from many of the galaxies shown in the deep field image from the James Webb Telescope. From googling I'm understanding that these arcs are generally the result of gravitational lensing caused by a mass outside the focus of the image. My specific question stems from the multiple arcs that aren't concentric.

I've worked to the perhaps invalid understanding that each non-concentric arc must represent a different lense (gravitational mass) How is a single perspective (the telescope) able to focus the light from multiple lenses at once?

Text: Assuming there is a frontal collision of 2 cars, are there any differences in safety between heavy trucks and lighter cars?

 I mean, there are some claims that due to how rigid the reinforced frame in heavy vehicles is, one is more susceptible to organ damage due to how kinetic energy is transferred. 

In case of lighter ones, they are intentionally made in a way that makes the body and chassis &quot;absorb&quot; the energy in order to reduce the damage the crash inflicts on the passengers. 

I guess the outcome of a collision could rely on the differences in weight between the participants.

TLDR: would a heavy vehicle be a better option safety wise? Or are there other factors in play?

Text: &gt; &quot;The mass, size, and shape of the object are not a factor in describing the motion of the object. So all objects, regardless of size or shape or weight, free fall with the same acceleration.&quot; Nasa

&gt; &quot;As such, all objects free fall at the same rate regardless of their mass.&quot;

So all objects fall at the same speed regardless of their mass. Therefore, an object's **mass doesn't matter**. Okay.

&gt; &quot;Terminal velocity will depend on the mass, cross sectional area, and drag coefficient of the object as well as the density of the fluid through which the object is falling and gravitational accelleration.&quot;

But now I'm told that **mass do matter**, and that an object with more mass will fall faster?

So do they or do they not fall at different speed...?

I've heard of direct mechanisms for this that are below the Chandrasekhar Limit using carbon or hydrogen black dwarfs and brown dwarfs and some using neutron star collisions releasing &quot;degenerate gas&quot; (I assume this is a form of degenerate matter?). My questions are, How common are these interactions expected to be? Is it likely to happen anywhere in the universe multiple times in sequence? And What are these stars expected to be like?

Text: The James Webb Space Telescope famously records infrared wavelengths to get better images because infrared light can penetrate dust and molecular clouds. The recent images that are released are stunning, but as with many space telescope images, they are false color. This is not a problem; it's still the real image, real data, and really beautiful, but while looking up how they do the false coloring [this article](https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/07/06/webbs-fine-guidance-sensor-provides-a-preview/) references &quot;color filters&quot; that are required for the telescopes operation. [Another article](https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2022-07-12/james-webb-space-telescope-a-guide-to-the-first-full-color-image.html) mentions blue, green, and red filters (this one is not from NASA, so I cannot verify it's validity). Blue, green, and red are visible wavelengths, so how do these filters work with an infrared camera? Thank you!

If what we’re doing is looking into the early universe, and the universe has been expanding since the Big Bang, then aren’t we just seeing those first galaxies as they were closer together than they would be today? 

And if what we’re seeing is the very beginning of the universe then wouldn’t pointing the telescope anywhere else for a long enough time reveal a similar picture? In fact, wouldn’t we technically be seeing even the same early galaxies no matter where you point it at?

Text: My understanding of math/physics is formally at an undergraduate level, so I apologize in advance if my questions are confusing or not very well formulated.

I've watched some videos about the holographic principle and how it was the attempts to solve the so-called black hole information paradox that lead to the development of string theories and the holographic principle. Ultimately this culminates in the correspondence between Anti-de Sitter spaces (a model of the universe under general relativity) and conformal field theories (i.e., quantum field theories). In the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klpDHn8viX8), the presenter tells us two things: 1.) That this correspondence leads to a &quot;natural&quot; theory of quantum gravity, and 2.) that interactions (between quantum particles?) on the boundary of the mathematical object's surface correspond to the emergence of gravity within the volume. However, he tells us that this isn't applicable to *our* universe, because anti-de Sitter spaces assume a negative curvature on the space-time metric, while as far as I understand, in reality it is zero (i.e., a Minkowski space-time).

So my questions are twofold: what quantum information is the problem here, and in need of conservation; are they things like spins and energies, and why does this lead to the holographic principle? Secondly, what is being said about the actual physics going on between quantum field theories and gravity with regards to this strange mathematical object?

Text: In a James Webb photo thread, someone posted that the Carina Nebula has a density of a few atoms per cubic meter. This seems off to me, as this is close to the average density of the intergalactic medium of one atom per cubic meter, which is much less than the interstellar medium average density of one atom per cubic centimeter, which is much less than the average density of a planetary nebular (100-10,000 atoms per cubic centimeter). But I can't find any information on the web to help me understand this better.

This is often stated to be too difficult to build/maintain or not economically feasible. Yet a US aircraft carrier is able to purify roughly 250,000 gallons of seawater a day. How is this not seen as proof of concept? Why can we not purify the water by building nuclear reactors that recapture the steam used to generate power as clean water on a large scale?

Text: Two reasons actually, first, how do we know they are still entangled from just one end? And does the knowing disrupt the entanglement?

So if we have two entangled particles and we send one out to orbit Jupiter (or anywhere far away) on a spaceship, can the people on the ship know if the particle is still entangled without disrupting the entanglement and without communicating at all with the people holding the other particle on Earth?

What if we had the tech to send sets of 26 entangles particle pairs on the ship, for simple example we send 3 sets of 26 entangled particles, and designate each pair in each 26 set a letter of the alphabet, then the people on earth interrupted the pair, in the first set of 26, with the designation of the letter Y causing it to disentangle so the people on the ship would know that we disentangled the letter Y pair. Then the second set the people on Earth caused the pair designated letter E to disentangle, and then the third set they disentangle the pair designated letter S, have we not just communicated FTL?

I'm a stupid monkey so just tell me why.

+ Large-Scale Structure: Matter in the Universe forms a &quot;cosmic web&quot; with clusters, filaments and voids. The positions of galaxies in the sky shows imprints of the physics in the early universe
+ Dark Matter: Most matter in the universe seems to be &quot;Dark Matter&quot;, i.e. not noticeable through any means except for its effect on light and other matter via gravity
+ Dark Energy: The unknown force causing the universe's expansion to accelerate today

* I have not been as “safe” as one could be, and have been in largely unmasked crowds on occasion. I have been to stores, out with friends, on vacation, etc. — always following Covid guidelines, but when given the option not to mask up, I have chosen not to. 
* Luckily, to my knowledge, I have not been infected by Covid-19 a second time. 

If your body produces antibodies after infection, is it possible that continued exposure to Covid would ensure your body continues to produce antibodies?

Why would continual exposure to Covid *not* act similarly to a booster?

And what do the sperm whales do when they sleep in this strange buoyant way ? how do they stay buoyant while sleeping ?

Or do they just &quot;overpower&quot; the density change with muscle power ?

Could there be planets where potential lifeforms might have to evolv to see x-rays or microwaves in order to observe their world?

If some planets received a different composition of light waves than ours I suspect it might be possible but I don't know if that is physically accurate. 

I know there are different types of stars and I know that the consensus is that a planet needs to be in the 'goldilocks zone' of a star to support life.

Almost every cactus is capable of producing fertile, hybrids within its genus. Beyond that, it's been found that many cacti are even capable of intergeneric hybridization. Desert cacti are supposed to have diverged and evolved during a worldwide drying event roughly 10-25 mya (I'm assuming the rainforest/vining species evolved at a similar time) This is relatively recent on the scale of plant evolution, is this why they're able to graft and breed so freely? They haven't had enough time to diverge to the point of incompatibility?

Text: Summary: Large solid chunk of steel submerged in a solution of copper(ii) sulfate and tin(ii) sulfate (estimated ration of 10-1). Left to sit for 24 hours. Reaction expected to produce precipitates of metallic copper and tin and a solution of iron(ii) sulfate.

Question: Would the copper and tin precipitate out as a metallic alloy, or would they come out as separate layers, crystals, etc.. ?

So... I've been messing around with copper(ii) sulfate for the past few days. One of my ongoing experiments started with putting scrap electronics solder in a solution of the stuff. My idea was the tin and lead would replace the copper and leave a solution of pure tin(ii) sulfate and insoluble lead(ii) sulfate and copper metal. The results were promising as I was left with a beautiful turquoise blue solution along with white precipitate of lead(ii) sulfate and copper collecting on the old solder. My only mistake was that I did not have enough solder, and so the resulting solution was still mostly copper(ii) sulfate.

It was this mixture of tin(ii) sulfate and copper(ii) sulfate that I added a slightly rusted steel hammer head to. I honestly didn't have a plan at this point other then a quick google search to see where iron was in terms of reactivity. Success on that: I now have an almost pure solution of iron(ii) sulfate. I will likely continue using sulfate to juggle metal ions with reckless abandon.

It's the hammer head I sacrificed that I'm really curios about. It's completely covered in copper crystals and I'm pretty certain the tin is mixed in as well. I'll link a picture in the comments. I really want to know if I just accidentally made a copper-tin alloy.

Text: So searching for radio telescopes I found that there are almost none currently operating in space and historically very few as well. Most of the big radio dishes in space are turned Earthwards for spying purposes.

As a layperson this strikes me as strange because it seems like a radio telescope would be significantly easier to build and launch than an optical telescope. 

A few possible guesses come to mind based on my small amount of astronomy knowledge:

Fewer advantages over land-based observation, relative to an optical scope?

Interferometry using huge numbers of smaller ground based dishes simply more useful?

Some engineering challenge I'm not considering?

Text: In trying to research potential treatments for glioblastoma, I came across cannabinoids.  It seems like they all fight cancer (glioblastoma specifically) and could inevitably some day cure people's cancers.  There have been hundreds of studies, but as near as I can tell there has never once been a single study that tested these in live humans, without being administered in combination with chemo and radiation.  I heard a long time ago that they will never ever do that because if a person dies then someone gets blamed for not using chemo and radiation.  That kind of logic seems designed to forever prevent there from being any kind of cure or alternative to chemo and radiation, ever.

Do they ever do any in vivo studies on any (new or existing) cancer drugs that are not designed to see if the drug can &quot;assist&quot; chemo and radiation?  If not, is there any &quot;path forward&quot; for anyone to ever develop a drug that actually cures cancer?

Text: Say there's a cloud of plasma floating in space, and there's a uniform magnetic field around/permeating it. If there is also an electric field present, the plasma will move in the direction of E x B, from what I understand.

Now say there is a beam of laser light shooting through the plasma. Light is made of photons, which are electromagnetic oscillations.

So how does a photon end up affecting the plasma?

One option I could see is that the electric field from the laser and the background magnetic field means the plasma moves in the E_laser x B_background direction.

Another option is that it moves in the E_laser x B_laser direction.

Another option is that it doesn't move but oscillates back and forth along one of those directions, because light is oscillating.

Another option is that it moves in the direction the light was going, because light has momentum and its pushing the plasma. Which is just the 2nd option, but with a different reason.

Another option is that it doesn't move at all and I don't understand photons.

Text: Genetic testing for Tay-Sachs begin in the 70s.

Since then [the incidence of Tay-Sachs has fallen by more than 90 percent among Jews, thanks to a combination of scientific advances and volunteer community activism that brought screening for the disease into synagogues, Jewish community centers and, eventually, routine medical care.](https://www.timesofisrael.com/how-jewish-activism-has-wiped-out-tay-sachs/#:~:text=Since%20the%20'70s%2C%20the%20incidence,%2C%20eventually%2C%20routine%20medical%20care.)

[Until 1969, when doctors discovered the enzyme that made testing possible to determine whether parents were carriers of Tay-Sachs, 50 to 60 affected Jewish children were born each year in the United States and Canada. After mass screenings began in 1971, the numbers declined to two to five Jewish births a year, said Karen Zeiger, whose first child died of Tay-Sachs.](https://www.timesofisrael.com/how-jewish-activism-has-wiped-out-tay-sachs/#:~:text=Since%20the%20'70s%2C%20the%20incidence,%2C%20eventually%2C%20routine%20medical%20care.)

[Tay–Sachs disease is a genetic disorder that results in the destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.[1] The most common form is infantile Tay–Sachs disease, which becomes apparent around three to six months of age, with the baby losing the ability to turn over, sit, or crawl.[1] This is then followed by seizures, hearing loss, and inability to move, with death usually occurring by the age of three to five.[3][1] Less commonly, the disease may occur in later childhood or adulthood (juvenile or late-onset).[1] These forms tend to be less severe,[1] but the juvenile form typically results in death by age 15.](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease)

[Tay–Sachs disease is caused by a genetic mutation in the HEXA gene on chromosome 15, which codes for a subunit of the hexosaminidase enzyme known as hexosaminidase A. It is inherited from a person's parents in an autosomal recessive manner.](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease)

[Three main approaches have been used to prevent or reduce the incidence of Tay–Sachs:](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease&amp;section=8)

+ [Prenatal diagnosis. If both parents are identified as carriers, prenatal genetic testing can determine whether the fetus has inherited a defective gene copy from both parents.[30] Chorionic villus sampling (CVS), the most common form of prenatal diagnosis, can be performed between 10 and 14 weeks of gestation. Amniocentesis is usually performed at 15–18 weeks. These procedures have risks of miscarriage of 1% or less.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease&amp;section=8)
+ [Preimplantation genetic diagnosis. By retrieving the mother's eggs for in vitro fertilization, it is possible to test the embryo for the disorder prior to implantation. Healthy embryos are then selected and transferred into the mother's womb, while unhealthy embryos are discarded. In addition to Tay–Sachs disease, preimplantation genetic diagnosis has been used to prevent cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia among other genetic disorders.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease&amp;section=8)
+ [Mate selection. In Orthodox Jewish circles, the organization Dor Yeshorim carries out an anonymous screening program so that carriers for Tay–Sachs and other genetic disorders can avoid marrying each other.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease&amp;section=8)

Each of the mechanisms above would work to eliminate embryos with two Tay-Sachs genes, and preimplantation genetic diagnoses could be used to eliminate embryos with one Tay-Sachs gene, though I have no reason to think it is used that way.

By eliminating embryos with two Tay-Sachs genes, adults (who could reproduce) with Tay-Sachs are also eliminated and so I would think that over time, the genetic frequency of the Tay-Sachs disorder would decline.

Is there any evidence of this for Tay-Sachs?

Has the gene frequency of any recessive genetic disorder been reduced through screening mechanisms?

However eggs are living cells that are still attached to the host body and are being fed/wasted carried away from. Is this the same action that happens inside a queens body's when they store sperm for up to 25 years? Or is there a different mechanism of action?

If you have info related to other animals besides queen ants I'd be interested in hearing it as well.

Is it all about mixing - or are there other effects at play?

Text: Forgive the weird question, but I was curious. From what I understand bicephaly in reptiles is typically caused by either genetic or environmental factors, the most common being abnormal incubation temperatures. I was wondering if there is any sort of physical trauma that could result in bicephaly, such as an egg being dropped or slightly damaged? If so, would it be possible for scientists to make a notch in a developing embryo and encourage bicephaly? I know it's kind of morbid, but I was really curious as to whether or not physical environmental factors have an impact on this since I couldn't find many sources surrounding it!

Text: Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Physics, Astronomy, Earth and Planetary Science**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for 'X' were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;.

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

If you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/about/sticky).

Text: **Please read this entire post carefully and format your application appropriately.**

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/s93rpe/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxvi/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).
* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)
* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)
* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?
* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

\-------------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

`Username: /u/foretopsail`

`General field: Anthropology`

`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`

`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`

`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`

`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

You can submit your application by replying to this post.

Text: A friend and I were looking at some news stories and wiki articles about solar storms, and we were really confused by how many of the news articles seem to be making a big deal of the upcoming solar cycle maximum, but other resources say that we're expected to have a quieter-than-average solar cycle.

We're aware of the risks and big events that are possible with solar cycle maximums, but since a lot of news stories sound like they're trying to convince us that the sun is about to kill us all, we're looking for something a little bit more nuanced to give us some perspective. My friend is interested in astronomy but *also has astrophobia* so has been looking for something a little more reassuring than articles constantly popping up on his social media recommendations that exaggerate for clicks.

What should we actually expect, and what should we look for in news articles to tell us what we actually need to know?

During my time finding graphene online, I also found out that it can be manufactured into fibers. And an idea went up in my head: *&quot;What if I use graphene fiber, instead of carbon fiber?&quot;*. After all, it's more better in a lot ways than carbon fiber, especially in cost. Like, you can make your own graphene at home-type cheap. 

BAC motors made a sports car that has graphene body panels, probably using graphene in its' fiber form, that's what I think is most likely how they used it. I read an article about it, but the article didn't say how the graphene became as applicable as carbon fiber, like how BAC used carbon fiber. 

Does graphene fiber need to be impregnated with resin, like carbon fiber? Or no, it doesn't need to be impregnated with resin?

Text: Here's a hypothetical scenario I'm trying to figure out:

Say I have a basket of 250 apples, and one of them is poisoned. So if I eat one apple out of the basket, I have a 1:250 chance of dying.

Now, say I was given the opportunity to instead eat an apple from another basket that holds 2,175 apples (one being poisoned), but to get that opportunity, I first have to eat one from a basket of 30,000 apples.

My question is: How do I calculate the combined probability of me dying when first having eaten from the 30,000 basket, then the 2,175 basket? How much safer is that option than just eating from the original 250 apple basket?

I think the size of both sets are the same? For Cantor's diagonal argument, if you match up every integer with a real number (btw is it even possible to do so since the size is infinite) and create a new real number by changing a digit from each real number, can't you do the same thing with integers?  


Edit: For irrational numbers or real numbers with infinite digits (ex. 1/3), can't we reverse their digits over the decimal point and get the same number? Like &quot;0.333...&quot; would correspond to &quot;...333&quot;?

Arguments for yes: we (humans) are very invasive, and pesticides are powerful.

Arguments for no: the houses' area are insignificant compared to the wooded/grassy area. More over, we are creating a nutrition-rich environment for these insects and that's why they are around us. So we are killing as many as we produce.

Text: Hello! First post here so bear with me.
So, ever since I recovered from covid in May 2021, I've had this long covid wheezing and coughing it's not extreme just a little bit don't worry, anyway I was thinking, I just woke up from a night's sleep and I was coughing last night and now this morning. Why do we not cough in our sleep? Does coughing require consciousness? Or is it something else, maybe it could be related to our breathing patterns? Like when you try taking deep breaths to stop wheezing but cough bad while you exhale? Idk, I don't have anything near a biology background. 
Thank you in advance!
Ps:This may or may not be a stupid question so again, bear with me.

I know neutral is the return for the hot wire in 120v outlets in the USA. But in the USA, 120v is half of the 240v coming to the house. The other half is a grounding bus. Could someone explain it to me why we, USA homes need both, a neutral and a ground wire?  


I can't seem to google why both are needed... just that they are. And I thought I was a googlefu master. :(

If this is true, then can we assume it also applies to non humid areas?

Text: It seems as if the [Toba Catastrophe Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toba_catastrophe_theory) is on the way out. From my understanding of the theory itself, a genetic bottleneck that occurred ~75,000 years ago was linked to the Toba VEI-8 eruption. However, evidence showing that societies and cultures away from Southeast Asia continued to develop after the eruption, which has seemed to debunk the Toba Catastrophe Theory.

However, that still doesn't explain the genetic bottleneck found in humans around this time. So, my question is, are there any theories out there that suggest what may have caused this bottleneck? Or has the bottleneck's validity itself been brought into question?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;***This is the first time that detection of MPXV (DNA and virus by isolation) in environmental air samples from healthcare settings has been reported,.***  
&gt;  
&gt;***Detection of MPXV DNA in air samples collected at distances of greater than 1•5m from the patient and at a height of nearly 2m supports the theory that MPXV can be present in either aerosols, suspended skin particles or dust containing virus, and not only in large respiratory droplets that fall to the ground within 1 to 1-5m of an infected individual.***  
&gt;  
&gt;***Five out of fifteen air samples taken were positive. Significantly, three of four air samples collected during a bed linen change in one patient's room were positive (Ct 32-7-35-8). Interpretation: These data demonstrate significant contamination in isolation facilities and potential for aerosolisation of MPXV during specific activities.***  
&gt;  
&gt;***We identified widespread MPXV DNA contamination of the environment in respiratory isolation rooms occupied by infected symptomatic individuals.***

&amp;#x200B;

Trying to parse the implications of this study. 2m (6.5 feet) above the patient sounds like it's airborne right?

Maybe we shouldn't be sending potentially contagious patients to STI clinics like we currently are?

Text: I read that Si and GaAs, which are both used as semiconductors in computer chips, develop a very thin oxidation layer in air. I also read that the one that Si develops is insoluble in water, so it is a good passivation layer, while the one that GaAs develps contains water soluble oxides, so it is not a good passivation.

On the other hand in the industry, the GaAs oxidation layer is etched off with acid, when GaAs wafers are used - why is this done, and not just water used, if the oxides are water soluble? And how can I imagine the oxide layer itself, is it something that is firmly &quot;bonded&quot; to the GaAs or Si underneath, or is it something more &quot;volatile&quot; that is easily removed? As in: is it really part of the surface, or just &quot;lying on top of it&quot;?

I'm not a chemist, I just read a lot about semiconductor materials recently and am curious.

Text:  

If we have a population of normal and cancer cells, and we give a drug to this population. And lets say this drug induces apoptosis. Usually, the drug would have a detrimental effects on the cancerous cells, but would pretty much cause the normal cells to be unaffected. How is that? If the drug can induce cell death in both normal and cancerous cells, why do the cancerous cells tend to die first? Is it because cancerous cells are way better at metabolism than non-cancerous cells, and so they suck everything from their environment; Therefore the normal cells get a small quantity of the drug, while the cancerous cells consume most of it and hence die?

(I know that some drugs might target  molecules that are unique to cancerous cells. However for the ones that are non-specific, how do these drugs manage to destroy our cancerous cells pretty well, while sort of not over-harming our normal cells)

Let's say you have a donut-shaped pool with jets that keep the water moving clockwise with negligible turbulence and a spherical object floating in that pool. Without bumping into the sides, would the ball begin spinning relative to the ground or stay facing relatively the same direction? 

Thinking about the forces involved, my intuition tells me that the force of the water acting on the ball should always be tangential to the donut. Also, would the stream of water keep the ball in the center, or would it be flung to the outside perimeter of the pool? How would the situation change if it were a neutrally buoyant sphere in a cylindrical pipe?

Text: The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease says that the accumulation of the peptide amyloid-β in the brain is the main cause of the disease. However, after decades of research and clinical trials there has been little to no success in treating Alzheimer's patients based on this hypothesis, and it has been questioned, see for example:

&gt;[The amyloid hypothesis on trial. As the development of treatments for Alzheimer’s disease continues to stumble, is it time for researchers to broaden their list of the condition’s potential causes?
](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05719-4)

It was recently reported that some western blot images which claim to show a sub-type of amyloid beta, Aβ\*56, may have been manipulated. The report was the result of an investigation by *Science*:

&gt;[Blots on a field? A neuroscience image sleuth finds signs of fabrication in scores of Alzheimer’s articles, threatening a reigning theory of the disease](https://www.science.org/content/article/potential-fabrication-research-images-threatens-key-theory-alzheimers-disease)

Such manipulations the report claims go back to the original 2006 paper describing Aβ\*56 in *Nature*  written by Sylvain Lesné and Karen Ashe:

&gt;[A specific amyloid-β protein assembly in the brain impairs memory](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04533)

From the report in *Science* one may get the impression that the vast majority of Aβ plaque-related research and drug development since then has been focused on the Aβ\*56 subtype, in which case the alleged fraud would be an enormous setback to the field, with billions of dollars and decades of research time wasted. However, there are many types of Aβ and I'm unclear on just how important Aβ\*56 is to the field of Alzheimer's research and drug development. My initial thought was that there's no way all this time, effort, and money has been invested in something that only one lab has published (even if they've published on it many times) and no independent researchers have validated. The *Science* report says that some others have detected Aβ\*56 but I don't know in what context, or if this other work validates the work from Lesné and Ashe:

&gt;In the 16 years following the landmark paper, Lesné and Ashe—separately or jointly—published many articles on their stellar oligomer. Yet only a handful of other groups have reported detecting Aβ\*56.

An article on Alzforum has comments from some of the scientists involved in the controversy:

&gt;[Sylvain Lesné, Who Found Aβ*56, Accused of Image Manipulation](https://www.alzforum.org/news/community-news/sylvain-lesne-who-found-av56-accused-image-manipulation)

In particular, the top comment which is from Karen Ashe, the senior author on the original 2006 paper:

&gt;...it is clear that there are two general forms of Aβ, type 1 and type 2. One particular form of type 1 (referred to in our papers as Aβ\*56 and in the Science article as “toxic oligomers”) was shown by my lab and others to impair memory function in mice. The type 2 form of Aβ is the one found in amyloid plaques. It is this latter form that drug developers have repeatedly but unsuccessfully targeted. There have been no clinical trials targeting the type 1 form of Aβ...

Scientific misconduct or fraud is of course terrible, and if true I'm sure this has set back at least some progress in the field. But just how significant is this fraud if it's true?

Text: I know psychology has not had the best reputation when it comes to the results of studies being replicated, but my question stems around direct replication and the results pulled from those. I understand that if you are going to directly replicate a study, you would use all the same materials from the original study, but would you try and use the same amount of participants or try and get close to it? So, let's say that I try and directly replicate a study from 1992 on Adolescent aggression and video game usage, I would use all the same materials, so in this case, Street Fighter from 1992 on an arcade machine and then measure aggression using the same surveys from the original study.  But let's say the original study had 51 eleven year olds, would you try and get exactly 51 eleven year olds for your replication? or would you try and get close? or does it even matter?

Text: Do stars simply put out enough light that the angle between two adjacent photons are sufficiently narrow, ie &lt;1mm separation at 1000 light years? Or does this have to do with the wave nature of photons so a single photon is detectable over a wide area? How small would a light detector need to be for a standard star 1000 LY away to disappear and reappear as the detector is moved around?

Text: I've read that Monkey Pox isn't an STD. So why is MSM, allegedly, the most afflicted group according to the WHO?

Edit: Unfortunately, I feel that the answers aren't clear enough and I still have doubts.

I understand that Monkeypox isn't strictly an STD, and it's mainly transmitted by skin-to-skin contact and respiratory secretions during prolonged face-to-face contact. So, I still don't understand why are the media and health organizations focusing specifically on the MSM demographic.

Even if the spread, allegedly, began in some sort of gay event, any person, regardless of sexual orientation,  could eventually get infected with Monkeypox. It's not as if MSM only had contact with other MSM. They might also spread the disease to their heterosexual friends, coworkers, acquaintances, and relatives.

In the worst-case scenario in which we aren't able to contain Monkeypox, LGBT people who don't even participate in random sexual encounters or social gatherings might get infected by heterosexual carriers.

Shouldn't the narrative be changed to &quot;people who partake in hook-up culture and large social events&quot;? What does sexual orientation have to do with the spread of the disease?

Edit2: I'm reading an alarming number of baseless assumptions and stereotypes about MSM or gay men in general, I honestly thought this subreddit was much better.

Text: For context I am a student in second semester college general chemistry, my upcoming lab we are using tartaric acid for analysis using acid-base titration, and in the lab introduction it mentions that tartaric acid is a diprotic acid and gives the molecular structure.  I am just confused how tartaric acid is diprotic since it contains four hydroxides in its molecular structure; does this mean that only two of its hydroxides are reactive?  Maybe it means that after two protons have been donated, the structure changes to where it is no longer able to donate protons?  Any insight is appreciated, thank you.

As we know, bacteria have begun to 'learn' how to overcome these antibiotics and we now have some types of infectious bacterial diseases that are immune to virtually all known antibiotics.

Would these 'super bacteria' also be dangerous to fungi, including molds and mushrooms? If so, what would that mean for the ecosystem and humans?

To paint a hypothetical situation for an example, let's consider a child who starts out liking its teddy bear, but because that teddy bear was often present along with another (negative) stimulus, it began fearing or even hating the teddy bear. How can you determine which of the stimuli will be conditioned? 

And can you somehow &quot;force&quot; a particular one of them to be conditioned? Could you perhaps use that teddy bear to condition a negative stimulus (like fear of the dark) into a positive stimulus (eg. an apathy/ambivalence towards the dark, or perhaps even fascination with the dark)?

I was told recently that if your flame burns blue, it doesn't produce carbon monoxide (or not nearly as much as yellow). I don't see how that would work. The color of a flame (in a commercial gas combustion) is dependent on its temperature, I can imagine maybe, if your flame's yellow it partially burns the gas supplied, leading to more gas in the air, but certainly not carbon monoxide, no?

If this is the case (please let me know if my assumptions are wrong), why does it seem like hybrid power trains of cars and boats have their combustion engines linked to the power train through a drive shaft rather than just producing more electricity to drive the electric motors? I get the sometimes they might be doing this to get more power and avoid having to install more powerful electric motors to accept the power from the generator rather than just the batteries, but it seems just having more range would a huge advantage. Is there something I'm missing?

However this got me thinking, is there any strong evidence that the reflective nature of white paint used on airliners helps combat exposure to UV-A, B or ionizing radiation for the occupants?

Text: Consider the potential due to a pure dipole... It's 
V=k(p.r)/|r|^3 ... where r is position vector of the point at which the potential is considered and p is dipole moment of the charge distribution... 

Because the net charge Q=0, p remains the same even if we shift the origin... Now consider shifting the origin such that |r| remains the same but r doesn't so that p.r has a different value now... Therefore V has a different value in this frame...

Why? Isn't the potential at a point just the potential difference between this point and a chosen reference point(which happens to be infinity in this case) which shouldn't change unless you change the reference point itself? 

Any explanation???

Text: This may sound really silly but for example, if there were covid particles in my throat or any virus in general, would something like hot tea 'destroy' the virus or even the cells that they have entered before they get a chance to spread?

I'm not talking about those that get stopped in the first line of defence, but rather the ones that make someone infected.

Thanks in advance!

Text: So I live in an area where people tend to pee outside a lot.

Tonight I saw someone pee outside - turned away of course while they went - and they left a puddle. Maybe an hour after, a rat came by and sat right in the puddle for a few seconds before scurrying off again.

Curious how long virus (COVID or anything else) stays active in urine once it hits the air.

Thanks in advance.

Update: a lot of discussion here about whether it's possible to transmit viruses through urine - the answer is yes, it's possible. I'm asking how long it stays active outside of the body, usually on the ground (may be different for different viruses/conditions).

Also, whether we should all be worried about the rat.

See CDC page on CMV for one example: [https://www.cdc.gov/cmv/overview.html](https://www.cdc.gov/cmv/overview.html)

Is a space rock constantly losing molecules on its surface as time goes on, and eventually there’s no rock left and the molecules also break down? How would the bonds holding the surface molecules to the interior break apart in a vacuum? A rock in a vacuum seems so permanent from my perspective but I know surprising things happen over huge timeframes.

Text: Hi reddit,

after my last question I read a bit more about materials in tech, and it's absolutely fascinating. I thought it was all just plastic and silicon, but there is a whole world of strange stuff out there.

I wanted to know what you can find in a phone and found those two cool papers:

    https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11664-014-3310-3
    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5940856/

They both ground down phones and analyzed their content. One thing was strange: Most things are somehow consistent over different phones (with some like lead becoming way less after RoHS in 2006, makes sense), but one is really strange: thallium.

In the second paper, it is found in some phones in the range of 20-300 mg/kg phone, but in most phones it does not appear at all. Same for the first paper: It is found in only 4 of the over 80 phones, with contents between 4-80 mg/kg phone. I could assume that they just did not find it even if it was there in the second case, but it does not sound correct to assume that if in the first paper they only found it very few of thos over 80 phones. I found many speicalized applications, but solar panels and medical equipment don't sound like phones. I also found a combination where it was used for wireless communications, but I can't find info on this in phones, so maybe that is more some kind base station material? Also if it is used as a dopant in semiconductors its concentration would be much much lower than it is in the phones where it was found. Since on this subreddit there seems to be someone knowledgable for every topic:

Where and how is thallium used in phones and in tech general? Is it in some chip on the PCB, in the display or somewhere else, which function does it have and why is it only found in some of them?

PS: The flair is hard, others could also fit...

Text: So I've been trying to understand plant taxonomy and to say it's been confusing would be an understatement. Different sources use different terms and models to describe it and no websites I've searched have really yielded me the answers I'm looking for. Right now I'm trying to figure out what clade vascular aquatic plants are in because from my understanding, they can't be in Tracheophyta, because those are specifically land plants. Is there a larger clade that forms *all* vascular plants, or am I thinking about this too hard and that's not how it works? From my studies I've also found that some websites just use clades to substitute other taxonomic ranks such as phylum and class. Is that appropriate or should they be in a proper rank, not just a clade?

Text: The patellar tendon goes from behind your kneecap to the front of your tibia (shinbone) and can get painfully inflamed or partially torn, sometimes referred to as Jumper's Knee. One method of dealing with that pain is to wear a tight strap around the leg across that tendon just below the knee - the straps usually have a hard lump that presses down on the tendon.

Anecdotally (and personally), this seems to really reduce the pain. But why? Usually, pressing on an injury would hurt more, not less. Here, the strap's functionality seems to be purely mechanical - it's not some &quot;copper infused fabric&quot; or anything like that - cinching it tighter seems to improve the result (until it's so tight it's cutting off blood flow), and removing the strap immediately removes the benefit. Why does this apparently help, and why does pressure on the patellar tendon seem to make it more stable? Is it applicable to any other tendonitis injuries?

Text: We all know that using a lithium ion battery causes it's capacity to decrease over the years. But I am interested in better understanding how different usage patterns impact the speed of this degradation. I've read some about the chemical mechanisms that cause this problem, and I've read several articles on &quot;best practices&quot; for battery health, but I still do not feel like I have a good understanding of everything.

For example, suppose we need to use 20% of the energy of a battery. Is it best for the long term health to only charge the battery up to 20%, and then drain it to 0%, and then back to 20%? Or is it better to go from 100%-80%-100%? Or is the optimal thing to split the middle and go from 60%-40%-60%?

I have also seen it mentioned that charging batteries more slowly improves their lifespan. Is this solely because of reduced heat, or is that still true even if temperature is removed from the equation? I have also seen many mentions of &quot;deep cycles&quot; being bad for the battery, meaning that multiple smaller discharges/recharges in a row are better than a longer discharge. Does this mean that, in the previous example, using the battery from 100%-80%-100% every day is worse for long term battery health than doing four sets of 100%-95%-100% every day?

While I would certainly appreciate any well-informed answer to the above questions, what I am ultimately searching for is a better understanding of the subject that would allow me to answer such questions myself.

Text: Griffths says that in the case of an orthonormal basis, the inner product of two vectors can be written very neatly in terms of their components...

&lt;a|b&gt;=a1\*b1+a2\*b2+....+an*bn 

But in order to know if a set is orthonormal or not we need to be able to calculate the dot product &lt;e_i|e_j&gt; and check if it is equal to del(ij) without actually being able to represent them (basis vectors) by some n-tuple of &quot;components with respect to another prescribed basis&quot;..., right? Otherwise we just get stuck in a never ending infinite staircase, isn't it?

So how do we do that? How do we know if the basis is orthonormal? In 3d real vector space we can just talk about projections(we can just visualise the thing) I know.... but how does this projection idea generalise to higher dimensional and also complex vector spaces without having to talk about an inner product?

And, additional question: Do particles of different materials get filtered with different probabilities - since they differ in mass and probably in their suface - , or is the particle material irrelevant and it's only about the size?

Apparently, their parents had taught them that if you pour hot liquid into a glass, it will explode, and to always use appropriate kitchen equipment (ceramic cups in this case). I had never heard of this before. We discussed this notion and did some googling and it seems that if you pour liquid with a large temperature difference to the glass into it, it can indeed make it fracture. So now we're wondering: 

1. Why does a rapid temperature change make glass fracture?

2. Can glass actually explode if the temperature difference is large enough? (e.g. taking a glass out of the freezer and pouring boiling hot liquid into it)

&quot; Also in 2014, Waldinger et al. offered the first evidence that the genital anesthesia in PSSD may involve a peripheral component \[[33](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6004927/#ref033)\]. A 43-year-old male developed penile anesthesia and scrotum hypesthesia on paroxetine which persisted after stopping the drug. He had attempted to assess the level of insensitivity by applying Tiger Balm to his penis, but felt nothing except a vague sensation over his scrotum. A small degree of tactile sensitivity was regained following treatment with low-power laser irradiation, though there was no improvement in sexual responsiveness. It was hypothesized that SSRIs may disrupt the normal functioning of transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels. &quot;

&amp;#x200B;

By what mechanisms can this happen? Penile anasthesia seems to be a disruption in the ionic channels, but how can this persist even when one is not taking the drug.

Text: How do biological tubes, eg intestines, blood vessels, form in-utero? Seems to me that it's actually quite a complicated structure for cells to try and coordinate across some distance, and it would be really easy for a barrier or a hole to form in the tube (which does happen - hernias - but not frequently). 

So how on earth can a complete tube form, both large and small, without holes or blockages?

Is this true, or is there a dating method that's accurate even when considering different conditions like that?

Text:  

Hi All,

If Climate Change were fake, then it should be easy to prove it by showing that CO2 does not, in fact, convert more light to heat energy as it passes through. They've known about the concept of a &quot;greenhouse gas&quot; for a century, though.

My question is, what is this property of a gas called?

It will be more complicated that just a constant value, because it will be dependent on the particular light wavelengths involved, but it must have a name.

Thanks!

Text:  From Newsweek

&quot;NASA has spotted a bright solar flare erupting from the side of the sun, suggesting a particularly active solar region could be rotating this way.

The flare can be seen in the [video](https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/latest48.php?q=0304) above that was captured by [NASA](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nasa)'s Solar Dynamics Observatory on Sunday. In it, a contorted plasma structure can be seen moving on the left-hand side of the sun shortly before it erupts into space.

Solar flares are eruptions of electromagnetic radiation from the sun that travel at the speed of light. The increased levels of X-ray and extreme ultraviolet radiation carried by flares can have an effect on Earth's ionosphere—a region of the atmosphere containing electrically-charged particles.&quot;

[https://www.newsweek.com/nasa-solar-flare-erupts-sun-source-sunspot-1729706](https://www.newsweek.com/nasa-solar-flare-erupts-sun-source-sunspot-1729706)

Some articles are more sensationalist, suggesting that it could knock out radios and electrical devices.

What exactly does this mean from a scientific perspective, and what are the risks associated with it?

Are there any papers that compare traits to dog breed, ideally controlling for how the dogs are trained?

Text: Yes, I'm aware that there have been semi-recent breakthroughs to suggest that the T-Rex had lips that covered its teeth. I'd like to take that one step further by postulating that the T-Rex had gums that fully concealed its teeth.

One thing that made me think about this was that I remembered hearing that the T-Rex likely had a pseudo-venom from the bacteria in its mouth, just like the Komodo dragon. Some sources I found state that the Komodo dragon's mouth bacteria can in large part be attributed to meat and guts that build up in its thick gums.

On the other hand, the Komodo dragon eats its prey whole, while the T-Rex (I presume) tore large chunks at a time, like a crocodile does. 

Anyway, I haven't found any sources that may hint toward the Komodo theory, only ones that reinforce the whole lip thing. Does anyone know if there's any merit to this? Why or why would it not be possible?

My question is; when litmus paper is left (away from acid, but exposed) should it stay the same colour? I only ask this as when we tear a piece off the roll a bit of it still sticks out of the container and guaranteed everytime that little bit turns dark red. We have asked our health and safety and one just ignored the question whilst the other said it was just what happens to it when exposed. By it turning red just sat away from acid does that mean ventilation is shit and we're all just breathing in acid? For example, out of curiosity I took a strip home in the car with me and that's still the same colour it was yesterday when I took it (orangey, yellow)

Text: When I see maps of the land and ice coverage during the Ice Age,  I keep noticing large sections of today's Eastern Russia free of glaciers. Does anyone want to take a stab at that? Is there an agreed upon reason? 

It can't be the ocean currents blowing warm water up around Japan, the same happens on the East Coast of the USA and they still had massive glaciers.

Text: If I were to cook in my house and produce water vapor, that vapor would spread out since gas expands to fill its container. Even when dirt gets kicked off the ground it either settles or becomes blown away and loses its visibility. How is it then that clouds can retain their form outside of a closed environment and still be able to be seen. I’ve never really understood clouds and the way they are visible despite being small individual vapor and dust particles in the atmosphere, and it is counter intuitive to me that clouds don’t disappear.

Text: First and foremost, apologies for the rudimentary question and with that, here is my question:

&amp;#x200B;

Embarrassingly, I've done this on more than one occasion and today got a bit of scalded.   Was heating up some oat milk (sometimes cows milk or plain water will also do this) in the microwave and when I put the frother in, the liquid starts to well up.   Is this due to the properties in the wand and or the temperature change?  The reaction is quite violent depending on how hot the liquid is.    


My palm is likely going to blister and require some time to heal.   I mentioned that it happened before so why haven't I learned my lesson?  Because it doesn't happen all the time which I'll put it to the temperature of the liquid.   9/10 times it has little to no reaction.   I think this time superheated it because due to the confluence of less liquid volume and the temperature of the wand which may have been colder than usual since the AC was on.

Text: I’ve always heard the explanation “because the planet curves away from the moon as fast as it falls towards the planet” but this doesn’t make sense to me. The moon is not falling “down” relative to a universal plane, it is falling straight towards the center of the planet.

Why does the moon not fall towards the planet in a spiral pattern? How does the moon’s momentum “counteract” the constant force of gravity?

If we compare it to a tennis ball on a rope, the tennis ball also does not fall towards the center despite the rope pulling on it, even if the rope is being flexed strongly outwards. But this is because the person is swinging the ball on the rope, providing a constant force tangential to its “orbit.”

A moon orbiting a planet has only one force on it: gravity. There is no tangential force, only tangential motion to to its momentum. How does only its momentum keep it afloat?

I also know (presume?) a woman is born with all the eggs she will ever have, and menopause happens when a woman &quot;runs out of eggs&quot;. If this is true then shouldn't there be a backup of eggs for a woman to use if they never go through the full process and get released?

I am aware menopause only happens in a few mammalian species: the great apes, orcas, elephants, etc. So perhaps there is some sort of biological clock in our brains?

Text: This has been a question that’s been really on my mind regarding monkeypox and really other viruses in general. All the media and public health education literature states the virus spreads from “close skin to skin contact”. But what exactly does that entail on a microscopic level for the virus (or other viruses spreading like this)? 

Can this virus actually penetrate intact skin? For example if enough viral particles touch my forearm can it penetrate into my body? Or does it need to make contact eventually with a mucous membrane such as my mouth? 

As a secondary question: would good hand hygiene have a significant impact on prevention from contracting it?

Everything makes sense, but it left me with some questions: how does the heat get released when a substance freezes? From my basic thermodynamics &quot;knowledge&quot;, molecules have kinetic energy that they transform by bumping into other molecules. But when a substance freezes, the molecules lose this kinetic energy - how? Energy cannot be destroyed, so where does it go? Do they suddenly &quot;black body radiate&quot; all of it away? Does it mean that they emit photons that transfer this energy away?

Text: I understand that mitochondrial diseases that are caused by nuclear encoded proteins are easy to treat - the viral vector would just insert a plasmid containing the functional gene through the cell membrane and then it gets inserted into the nucleus. 

But I have not seen any mechanism that allows for the insertion of a plasmid into the mitochondria to replace a nonfunctional copy of the mitochondrial gene that is essential for mitochondrial functions? I understand that the mitochondria has a double membrane and thus harder to penetrate than the single membrane of the nucleus. But are there any groundbreaking works going on about this process?

Text: From what I understand, molecules bond with each other to form solids, possibly meaning to myself, that molecules only pull each other. 

Suppose you compress a piece of wood along its cross-section. What I imagine is that compressing them will only push and slide the molecules apart, which causes them to get pulled apart until the force exceeds their tensile strength resistance, same with shearing action, where the &quot;knife&quot; only pushes the cross-section of an object, causing that cross-section to be pulled apart from other cross-section. 

That's what I'm curious about.

Is this another example of independent organisms becoming functionally dependent on each other (like one of the steps along the way during the incorporation of mitochondria), or is this a case of convergent evolution?

As a follow-up, if they are relicts of independent organisms, do they have their own specific genetic lineages?

Text: I've always heard that pregnancy over ages 35 (often called  Advanced Maternal Age) is significantly more dangerous for both the woman and the baby, due to the higher risks of miscarriages, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes and decrease in fertility rates (as said [here](https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/geriatric-pregnancy), [here](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317861) and [here](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22438-advanced-maternal-age), for example). But, I watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9ryP0UyO5U), from &quot;Adam Ruins Everything&quot;, which provides evidence that the risks of getting pregnant between the ages of 35 and 40 don't increase as much as warned by the majority of doctors.

So, what's the truth about pregnancy after 35? If women could have babies until they were 40 without taking any more risks, it would be better to their careers.

Text: I watched a Physics 2 final review video before my class starts this semester to get a look at what I’ll learn this year and while taking notes I saw that the diffraction grating equation was d*sin(θ) =  m*λ which was very similar to the Bragg’s Law equation I learned in chemistry last year: 2d*sin(θ) = n*λ.

I watched a khan academy video on the double slit equation formula and understood it as a very good approximation allowed when the d is very small and the distance of the screen is relatively far away.  

If in any way these equations can be related, I’d Bragg’s law also an approximation.

I know these deal with different things but I I noticed they were similar and thought maybe by chance there might be some commonality.

Text: DNA and RNA are typically &quot;read&quot; in groups of 3 that we call codons. Each of those combinations of bases codes for a specific (but not necessarily unique) protein or other &quot;instruction&quot;, like start and stop. The entire collection of codons in a genome, in their particular order, &quot;defines&quot; an organism, so to speak. 

But where are the codons themselves defined? What determines which groups of 3 bases results in which amino acids? Is it included in the genome itself, like a compiler written in its own programming language? Or is it entirely reliant on the cellular machinery already existing from the parent with the codons pre-determined? I know there are some examples of different codons between different species but also that it's mostly the same among all life; has it really just been passed down through the unbroken chain of reproduction without ever being encoded?

Text: I understand the magnetic and electric fields are related, but from what I understand magnetic-only and electric-only fields can also be generated. I want to understand what kind of force these fields exert on magnetized and/or charged particles.

We have the Lorentz force: F =qE + (qv x B), but my confusion with this equation is that it takes into account only the charge, so, if the net charge is 0, then there is no force applied. Then, what about a particle that is not charged, but still has a magnetic dipole? Is there a general equation like Lorentz force to understnand such systems? I tried to look into magnetic dipoles and torques, but I am confused.

In the questions below, magnetic objects can be considered as objects having a magnetic dipole. So my question is, 

*What is the force exerted by ...*

1. an **electric field** on a charged, non-magnetic object?

The charged particle will follow the electric field lines (F=qE).

2. an **electric field** on a neutral, magnetic object?

As it is neutral, we have, q=0, so there is no force applied.

3. a **magnetic field** on a charged, non-magnetic object?

If it has velocity, it will have the result of a cross-product q(vxB), so the force will change the direction of the movement (right hand rule), but if the velocity is 0, then there is no force applied.

4. a **magnetic field** on a neutral, magnetic object?
So, according to equation, we never take this interaction into account. But, magnets do align themselves to magnetic fields, correct? Then, how so?

Are the conclusions correct? I am especially confused about 4.

 Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,
 Who heaven it self for ornament doth use,
 And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,
 Making a couplement of proud compare
 With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems:
 With April's first-born flowers and all things rare,
 That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
 O let me true in love but truly write,
 And then believe me, my love is as fair,
 As any mother's child, though not so bright
 As those gold candles fixed in heaven's air:
 Let them say more that like of hearsay well,
 I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
