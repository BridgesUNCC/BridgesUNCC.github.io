Title: Why does the ocean floor sharply drop off?

Text: I saw a map of the ocean floor, and after a small section of gentle down sloping near the continents (beach presumably) the floor just sharply drops off. Why isn’t it just a slope all the way down? Or a sharp drop off right at the edge of the continent?

Text: Animals that are poisonous tend to stick out visually. I usually see people claim this is evolved as a &quot;warning&quot; to other animals. If that's true, wouldn't the other animals have to evolve to recognize bright colors as a warning too? Also couldn't non-poisonous animals evolve to have bright colors so they trick predators into thinking they are poisonous? The bright colored thing never really made much sense to me, but it seems like lots of animals that have poison are usually colorful.

Text: It is known that after getting chickenpox, the virus stays in the body even if the immune system clears it. The virus hides in neurons and is suppressed by the immune system. It resurfaces as shingles in adulthood if one's immune system is weak. 

How about for the live, attenuated virus from chickenpox vaccine? Are they completely wiped out? Or do they stay also in the body similar with catching chickenpox from the wild?

Text: Animals that are poisonous tend to stick out visually. I usually see people claim this is evolved as a &quot;warning&quot; to other animals. If that's true, wouldn't the other animals have to evolve to recognize bright colors as a warning too? Also couldn't non-poisonous animals evolve to have bright colors so they trick predators into thinking they are poisonous? The bright colored thing never really made much sense to me, but it seems like lots of animals that have poison are usually colorful.

Text: Hello,

I am not sure to ask my question in the right place because I am writting something for a sci-fi story, but I need to understand some things. I would like to create a planet which has a day/night cycle of 12 hours. I found on the internet that only the speed rotation of the planet or its axis of inclination can affect the duration of the cycle.

So my questions are : Is it true ? Are there any other factors ? 

I was wondering if the size of the planet, its distance from its sun or the number of satellites are also some factors that could effect the day/night cycle's duration.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your time, and sorry if I'm not in the right place for this question (If I'm not, do you know where I shoul ask ?)

Text: I was wondering about the varying depths of large lakes.  I wondered if some sort general equation exists based on the volume of water versus the surface area to determine minimum (or typical?) depth?

&amp;#x200B;

Seems to me that some huge surface area lake, if only inches deep for example, would simply evaporate away.    


[My googling found this paper](https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/148413/Lake%20surface%20area.pdf?sequence=1) (PDF warning!) and while it isn't exactly what I'm asking about, it seems to suggest a minimum depth for the &quot;thermocline&quot; based (at least partially) on surface area.  Is this suggestive of what I'm trying to discover?

Text: Edit: By planetary system I mean a binary system 

I'm assuming it would be all but impossible to single out one or multiple moons around a rocky planet hundreds of light years away, but whenever I see an announcement of a new exoplanet &quot;nearly&quot; the size of the Earth, there never seems to be any doubt that it's a singular planet, as opposed to a binary system like our own. 

Granted, I think the moon is like 1/80th the mass of Earth, so if an alien observer viewed earth through a telescope similar to our own, the size of our earth probably wouldn't be swayed all that much by the presence of a moon, but who's to say all binary systems have such size discrepancy between them? Is it just basic physics that disallow such systems to exist for long periods of time?

Is there a possibility that a lot of the &quot;larger&quot; rocky planets with twice the mass of our earth could, in fact, be a system consisting of a planet closer in size to our own, but with one or multiple moons?

Text: Hi, I'm Prosanta, and I'm excited to answer all the questions you have about evolution (but have been afraid to ask). I think the science of evolution remains controversial among the general public (not among scientists) because the topic hasn't been explained very well and the facts are often misunderstood. After moving to Louisiana from New York City, where I grew up, the Governor of my adopted state, Bobby Jindal, passed a law that allowed public school teachers to introduce non-science (including religious) perspectives as alternatives when teaching evolution and other scientific topics. That's when I started to write my new book Explaining Life Through Evolution.

With the teaching of evolution being recently removed or banned from places like India and Türkiye (formally known as Turkey), and with more and more people learning about their ancestry from DNA tests, and with new gene editing tools like CRISPR becoming available, I think it is more important than ever that everyone understand evolution. The consequences of not understanding evolution have led to the promotion of racism and eugenics that are not in line with the science.

I'm here from (**2-4pm ET, 18-20 UT**) so ask me about [evolutionary misconception that just won't go extinct](https://bigthink.com/life/great-chain-being-evolutionary-misconception/) or about why we are [more fish than monkey](https://www.ted.com/talks/prosanta_chakrabarty_four_billion_years_of_evolution_in_six_minutes?language=en) or about [the roots of our 'Tree Of Life'](https://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/evolution-explaining-life-book/).

Text: On face value, it seems to me a parasitic relationship is unstable because of the parasite's conflicting interests. On the one hand, it has to drain the host for food/reproduction. On the other, it can't kill the host (too early) because it depends on it for survival. 

But if this is true, then parasitic relationships would have the tendency to break down or evolve into symbiotic ones, right?

Text: *edit* thanks all for the responses, I have learned some things here, this was very helpful.

Question background:

&quot;Uniqueness&quot; is a concept in mathematics: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniqueness_theorem

The example I know best is of Shannon information: it is proved to be the *unique measure* of uncertainty that satisfies some specific axioms. I kind of understand the proof. 

And I have heard of other measures that are said to be *the unique measure* that satisfies whatever requirements - they all happen to be information theory measures.

So, part 1 of my question: is &quot;uniqueness&quot; a concept restricted to IT-like measures (the link above says no to this *specifically*)? Or is it very general, like, does it makes sense to say that there's a unique function for *anything* measurable? Like, is f = ma the &quot;unique function&quot; for measuring force, in the same sense as sum(p log p) is the unique measure of uncertainty in the Shannon sense?

Part 2 of my question is: how special is uniqueness? Is every function a unique measure of *something*? Or are unique measures rare and hard to find? Or something in-between?

Text: I've come across various sources stating that the first transatlantic message took a staggering 16 hours to cross, but none of them explain why. Can someone shed some light on how electricity can slow down to under 200 miles per hour? Additionally, what's the reason behind the return journey taking only 1 hour? I'm curious about the technical aspects of this incredible feat in communication history. Thanks!

Text: I understand that wind is created by hot and cold air replacing each other by whooshing into the empty space. My question is how far a single gust travels? Like is it just temporary until the temperature balances the extremes? Or is it unstoppable force until it hits an immovable object? I live far from coasts and mountains, but are any of those winds reaching me? If I were to mark a gust in red, how long would I be able to track that single wind? I don’t mean the atoms and molecules. A ship that has had all the old red boards replaced with new red boards could still be tracked as the same ship. Do I feel wind from California on the east coast? Hawaii? Japan?

Text: First law of thermodynamics is often written as ΔU = Q - W where ΔU is the change in internal energy of the system, Q is added energy as heat, and W is the work the system does on the surroundings. 

There are other ways to write this formula/law. One of them is dU = δQ - δW, which I don't understand. The &quot;δ&quot;s in front of &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;W&quot; makes sense, since we are referring to infinitesimally small transitions of energy, as heat and work. But why the &quot;d&quot; in front of &quot;U&quot;? This &quot;d&quot; has nothing to do with differentiation, so why not use &quot;δ&quot; here as well? 

Lastly, I've seen people use the term ΔQ in other equations in thermodynamics. Since &quot;Q&quot; is already a change of something (correct me if I'm wrong), what's the point of the &quot;Δ&quot;? If we compared the heat added/removed from a system in 2 different scenarios, it kinda would make sense to talk about the difference in heat added/removed, but that's not how my teacher used the term ΔQ. They used it to reffer to &quot;change in the heat of the system&quot;. I thought heat wasn't a property a system has.

Wouldn't there be pockets of the same type of marble that occur over a range of area? 
One type of marble the website mentions is &quot;Portoro&quot;, where the quarry is owned by the Vatican but that still leaves 85 others that we collectively no longer have access to. Do different types of marble form in a very specific concentrated way?

Text: Given (P1 x V1) /T1 = (P2 x V2) / T2, and making p and v = 1 on both sides, and, finally, measuring the air temp in Kelvin, given an input temp of 293, or room temp, shouldn't the temp of the air in the vacuum cleaner be 234.4 if the vacuum cleaner achieves a 20% drop in pressure, which Wikipedia alleges it does? Cite here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum\_cleaner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_cleaner) 

Quote: &quot;For example, a typical domestic model has a suction of about negative 20 kPa.\[citation needed\] This means that it can lower the pressure inside the hose from normal atmospheric pressure (about 100 kPa) by 20 kPa.&quot;

This means a 20% drop. If I multiply 293 \* .8, I get 234.4. That's pretty cold. So does the temperature of the air inside a vacuum cleaner drop proportionately to the drop in pressure, and if so, why isn't it frosty cold?

So when we stick a finger into the 30 degree water, why are we not getting mini scalds all the time from the areas that are much higher temperatures than the average of 30 degrees?

Is there a real number that you could take the logathrim of such that a new number system could be formed that instead of using the sqrt(-1) as its extension it uses a number in the form log\_n(r). Where r is the real number and n is the base of the logathrim. If this can be done would it just unwind back into the complex numbers that we know or would it form a new number system with unique properties?

Text: For surgically treated (osteotomies) hip dysplasia (HD) I know several orthopaedic surgeons that discourage any kind of high impact activities; no jumping, running, lower body weight lifting (beyond even 5lbs), excessive hip flexion, etc. even years after surgery. The only exercises recommended were the elliptical and cycling, with light resistance activities (ex. with an ankle weight) and this advice has persisted until now. When I asked for more information, one doctor explained high impact exercises would degrade the hips faster because surgeries to fix HD create an abnormal joint shape that, with weight-bearing, degrade the connected bone due to the absence of cartilage to mitigate the friction.

However, I studied bio-medical science and read several journal articles published in the last 20 years that have *recommended* (or have not discouraged) weight lifting (high impact) with HD. I did not evaluate any articles based on if they were RCTs, nor did I weigh different sample sizes, length of follow-up, etc. I don't believe any of the linked studies looked at long-term outcomes (10+ years) of high impact activities on the actual bone, just reported pain and strength levels:

* [Feasibility and acceptability of a six-month exercise and patient education intervention for patients with hip dysplasia: A mixed methods study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468781222001151): progressive resistance training improved pain levels and hip strength.
* [Progressive resistance training in patients with hip dysplasia: A feasibility study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30132502/): Progressive resistance training led to stronger leg muscles and better pain levels.\*(fixed the link)
* [Does hip muscle strength and functional performance differ between football players with and without hip dysplasia?](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37598519/): Similar levels of hip muscle strength and functional performance were found in active football players with and without hip dysplasia. Authors were not sure if it was due to less advanced HD being present.
* [Rehabilitation Guidelines for Use Following a Periacetabular Osteotomy (PAO): A North American Based Delphi Consensus:](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9528724/) a panel of physiotherapists recommend a full return to sports with no limitations to weight-bearing activities 20 weeks after osteotomies (surgery to mediate HD)

However, my question is why orthopaedic doctors believe high impact activities have such a negative impact on HD when the (limited) research I've read point in the opposite direction. Is this just established knowledge among surgeons that has not been researched properly? Am I not researching the right terms or journals?

This question has confused me, so I would appreciate any answers! Thank you.  


  
Edit: By contrast, as study [Activity level and severity of dysplasia predict age atbernese periacetabular osteotomy for symptomatichip dysplasia](https://core.ac.uk/reader/70385647) found a correlation between high activity levels (measured on a scale from low to high impact) in those with hip dysplasia and fewer years before the need for an osteotomy (hip surgery).   


Like the above research, can't really answer my question, but there is evidence of a negative effect of high impact activities on prognosis. They used the UCLA score of activity with high impact examples like jogging, tennis, sports, skiing, etc. and didn't mention weightlifting, but I think it's safe to include in the list.

Text: I'm currently going into my third year of my MSci in Theoretical Physics (though I've gotten rusty over the summer and am trying to get back into the swing of things, so I might just be being an idiot or forgetting something lol).
  

  

  

  
I was reading Richard Feynman's book QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter and found his explanation of why light travels in a straight line not very satisfying. Here is a link to a pdf of this section of the book https://faculty.washington.edu/seattle/physics441/feynman-QED/qed2.pdf (specifically around page 53).
  

  

  

  
I'm probably just not understanding Feynman, but from what I understand from his examples and diagram on page 53, the paths that are nearly straight between points S to P generally have a very similar phase (or as per the analogy Feynman uses, have very similar stopwatch hand directions) and thus they contribute together greatly. In contrast other longer paths (like paths A and B) and their neighbors have much larger phase differences, so they are more likely to cancel each other out, thus leaving the contributions of the more direct paths. While this is convincing with the paths Feynman has outlined in the book, when looking at *every* path a photon could take we can very easily imagine many long, non-direct paths with very similar phases. Would Feynman's logic not also apply to these paths?
  

  
One answer to that question I can imagine is that when looking at every non-direct path, they will all end up cancelling each other out by the end of it, but why does this not happen for the direct path? I can imagine an answer for this coming from symmetry of the diagram, which would just leave the singular direct path as the only path left contributing but Feynman also emphasizes that its not only the direct path that contributes, but also paths like C and E. Why do these paths not get cancelled out? Is it that no path is fully cancelled out, but the more direct path just contributes far greater than non-direct paths, so we only really notice the biggest contribution i.e the direct path?
  

  
Another thing which I am not too sure of is surely there are also non-direct paths which share the phase of the direct path, so would we not also perceive light as travelling down those paths, not only as a straight line? Are there for whatever reason less non-direct paths with this phase, so while we may be able to detect these paths, they aren't as obvious as the direct path?
  

  

  

  
Sorry if these questions seem a bit confused, I can clarify in the comments a bit as best I can. It's not always easy to explain what exactly you don't understand about something. I also understand the Feynman has simplified this quite a bit, so that may be where my confusion is coming from.

Edit: omg thank you all for the input i did not think so many people would respond. I’m gonna read through it all and translate it into 9 year old terminology now LOL TY

Edit 2: I realize I know nothing and now I am confused if energy cannot be created or destroyed, then do we have limited energy since useless energy is *useless*?

Edit 3: so here is what I have gathered in a way that is digestible for 9 year olds 
 - sun energy goes to plants goes to animals animals get that energy to do animal things and is released mostly as heat and goes into air and exists, but is useless. It’s similar to matter, like when you fart the gas bubble has escaped, the gas still exists, but it’s diluted so much in space/around us that it is useless and will go unnoticed.  Energy cannot be created or destroyed in the same sense that matter cannot be created or destroyed

We have great data for how much the temperature is rising and surface ice is melting, but how accurate is our data for what is happening at the bottom of the ocean as the continents drift apart or into one another. Or how much water is being displaced when a mid-ocean volcano is pushing up a new island?

Is the continental shift so small that it doesn't factor in any meaningful way from year to year? I assumed it would, considering the sea rise is talked about as centimeters over a decade, which is a similar scale to the movement of continents.

Hi all,

Now I know you're probably seeing the title and think.. &quot;oh here he goes&quot; but please stay with me and help me understand something.

I know there isn't anything such as free energy but solar panels and light bulbs have always confused me.

Since a panel can be charged from a light bulb, why couldn't this generate enough energy to power the bulb again?

I know the bulb will only translate into a smaller about of power from the panel, but what if you just added more panels? 
That in conjunction with a low powered bulb.

It's something I've never understood.

For example, say 1 bulb with 1 panel, generated 10% of the required energy to power the bulb. Couldn't you just add 9 more panels? And 11 panels would then give a surplus.

If someone can clear this up and explain why this wouldn't work, I'd be grateful.

Thanks.

Now, I'd understand if the water did not end up back in river (like when you water your lawn) or if it did not came from a river (like underground reservoir), but both those things are mostly the case with agriculture and industry, not regular people in the city... So I feel like campaigns calling people to save water are another &quot;carbon footprint&quot; - basically pushing responsibility from actual culprits to regular people. 

(Obviously more used water means more water has to be treated but that's not a finite resource)

Text: So when a person gets for example a complete hand from a donor, i would assume the DNA of that hand is from the donor.

Then again they every part of a person get replaced in about 15 years(i.e. nails growing, skin shedding etc). So what will happen with the DNA already in the donated hand. Will this get replaced, or would it stay the same.
And how would for example a crime scene look after the person with the new hand commits a crime, would the police know about the added DNA? Sure they will find 2 DNAs, but how does that work?

Text: I am in Seattle looking at tides on Vancouver Island (specifically Bamfield station). 

Relative to the planet at large these locations are pretty nearby each other only 160 miles. The moon is almost the same direction from each. But today 9/30 in Seattle we have low tide at around noon but Bamfield will have their high tide just a little later at 1:40PM.  How can places so nearby have such disparate tides if the main driver is the moon? shouldn't that pull the high tide across the area as the earth turns?  is it entirely down to interference of the islands int he Salish sea? I would think that if islands were slowing water then the high and low would stay around the same time but that Seattle would just experience less extremes, the way we would in tsunami situations. This is clearly not the case since the tides are almost flipped.

Some of the offset is for the same reason that dawn is at different times across the same time zone but that isn't enough for it to entirely flip. in fact accounting for Banfield being further west makes it look even more neatly inverted.  

Many tide questions in this forum are about the Maine/Atlantic Canada situation and there's good info about why tides across that area share similarities. but why do tides in this area have such difference?

Text: I read following [on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_dip):

&gt;Magnetic dip, dip angle, or magnetic inclination is the angle made with the horizontal by the Earth's magnetic field lines. This angle varies at different points on the Earth's surface. Positive values of inclination indicate that the magnetic field of the Earth is pointing downward, into the Earth, at the point of measurement, and negative values indicate that it is pointing upward. The dip angle is in principle the angle made by the needle of a vertically held compass, though in practice ordinary compass needles may be weighted against dip or may be unable to move freely in the correct plane. The value can be measured more reliably with a special instrument typically known as a dip circle.  
&gt;  
&gt;Magnetic dip results from the tendency of a magnet to align itself with lines of magnetic field. As the Earth's magnetic field lines are not parallel to the surface, the north end of a compass needle will point upward in the southern hemisphere (negative dip) or downward in the northern hemisphere (positive dip).

However if you check [this diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic_Dip.svg) on wikipedia, it does not seem to match with above explanation. Or I am reading it wrong? (Sorry for giving external link to diagram, but this subreddit does not seem to allow embedding diagrams in the post.)

To be precise, this is what I did not understood:

1. Is the diagram indeed show compass needle by pointy shape above red-blue magnets? (I will assume yes in question 2 onwards)
2. The diagram shows that in the top most magnet has niddle pointing upward. However the article says:

&gt; compass needle will point upward in the southern hemisphere (negative dip) or downward in the northern hemisphere (positive dip)

Isnt the diagram contradict with above statement?

Text: Let's say I have a food source that amounts to 20,000 calories but I'm worried about protecting it from scavengers, predators, spoilage, etc.

Intuitively, it seems to make more sense to try and risk rationing the food. There might be some loss, but maybe rationing helps curb hunger and maybe the daily dopamine hit from small rations has an unmeasuable positive, psychological impact.

But strictly in terms of caloric intake, is there a quantitative difference between eating 20,000 calories worth of food over four days as opposed to eating 500 or 1000 calories a day (assuming a daily requirement of 2000 calories)?

Does your body spend energy to store the excess calories, and does that amount of energy negate eating more than your daily requirements? That is, how much energy is required to store the excess calories? Would there be an &quot;optimal&quot; amount of over eating?

On the flipside, does your body have to spend energy breaking down fat and muscle in order to supplement the caloric deficient, and does that amount of energy negate the logic of rationing?

Text: To me the answer seems obvious, that - all other things being equal - if someone has a train of reasoning in mind, where they think &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B because of A&quot;, then it should be easier to change &quot;B&quot; than to change &quot;A&quot;, i.e. it's easier to change conclusions than premises, since changing premises will tend to require also changing conclusions, and since that's more work it's harder to do.

To be clear, this is a question about psychology/thinking, *not* about logic or idealized deduction. I don't assume that human thought is especially rational or logical, generally, just that it does often involve these kinds of dependent relations between ideas.

I'm looking for studies from experimental psychology (or &quot;behavioral economics&quot; etc) that demonstrate such a difference, or that demonstrate that the obvious answer is actually not true and that the opposite is more likely the case (that it's easier to change premises than conclusions) - or that it's totally more complicated than this. Just anything where this particular question has been explored experimentally.

Text: 
I’m a wastewater operator. We have grit channels that are designed to aerate water to lower the density of incoming wastewater so that anything solid (sand, egg shells, ashes…) can fall out and be collected. Our governing body and manuals state “a properly aerated grit channel will remove up to 100% of grit” but nobody can tell us what “properly aerated” means. We are told that grit needs to move 0.5-1.0 feet per second through the channel but there is no way to measure that because the aeration creates turbulence across the water. Besides trial and error the only control option we have is dissolved oxygen content. So scientists of this app please tell me, at what dissolved oxygen in mg/L does the density of water change? It would be nice to get the density below 0.8 g/cm^3 so all grit can be removed early in the process to prevent damage to my pumps and pipes and not have to be removed manually later by shovels hoses and vactor trucks.

Text: Hello all! Our team, which consists of over 30 researchers, focuses on sustainable behaviour change, public acceptance of environmental policies and system changes, public participation in decision making, the effect of environmental behaviour and conditions of life quality (including environmental emotions like eco-anxiety).

We study the role of individual factors (such as values), group factors (such as group identity), as well as contextual factors. The main questions that our group seeks to answer: How can psychology help us understand and address environmental challenges? How can we motivate and empower people to act pro-environmentally and adapt to a changing environment?

We look forward to your questions! The researchers taking part are:

+ Professor Linda Steg
+ Associate professor Ellen van der Werff
+ Associate professor Goda Perlaviciute
+ Post doc Anne van Valkengoed
+ Post doc Lisa Novoradovskaya
+ PhD candidate Robert Goersch

The responding researcher will sign each answer they give, so you'll know who's who. You can find out more about our academic programme at https://www.rug.nl/masters/environmental-psychology/?lang=en and our research output at https://research.rug.nl/en/organisations/environmental-psychology

Is this a case of just having a greater amount of photons while the proportionality is more about singular photons?

Text: If you look at the density of matter in the atmosphere, the closer you are to space, the less dense the atmosphere.  The same generally applies to the ocean; the closer you are to the surface, the less dense the water becomes.  Does this general rule apply to the solid matter in the crust and all of the molten rock between the crust and the core?  Like, is the Earth's core the most dense place and the edge of the atmosphere the least dense with a relatively uniform density gradient between the two?

Text: I have been reading about what makes the tectonic plates move. At first, i came across this &quot;passive plate tectonic&quot; theory that mantle convections are the main force behind the movement of tectonic plates. which makes sense to me. However, now it is considered rather obsolete and &quot;Active plate tectonics&quot; theory takes its place which explains the motion of plates in term of gravity. According to it, ridge push and, more dominant one, slab pull derives the plate movement and convection current.   
However, i cannot seem to get the grasp of it and there are few lacunas in my mind:

1. There is no slab pull or ridge push if oceanic ridges aren't already formed. Like if there is no divergent boundary in the first place, there will be no raised surface at oceanic ridge and as a result no subduction zones. So, something must have been there to create this divergent boundary and the resulting subduction zones. **if it's not mantle convection then what?** i mean one can use this active theory to explain difference in the movements of different plates or how fast they are moving as compared to mantle convections but i don't know how can it explain the very first plate movement that gave rise to this slab pull and ridge push.
2. If mantle convections really aren't strong enough to make the plates move and slab pull is the one then what is happening at Convergent boundaries of two continental crust?

I would really appreciate any attempt to clear out these confusions.

Do other cancer cell lines rapidly degrade or accumulate too many mutations over successive replications that they're too unreliable to use in the lab? Are other cancer cell lines not hardy enough, when compared to HeLa cells? Is it because other cancer cell lines keep running into more problems the closer they reach limits like the Hayflick number? Or is it because researchers don't want to invest time in researching a novel cancer cell line, since everyone's cancer is genetically unique?

The video basically said gravity is really weak because you can defeat it by jumping in the air or stand up while the Earth's gravity is on you.

  
But is it weak? Isn't gravity relative?

  
The less I weight the less I'm drawn to the Earth, If I weighed 5 tons the Earths gravity would be a lot &quot;stronger&quot;.  
Even though I'm very light relative to the planet it still takes a lot of energy for me to leave the planet and enter space because of Earth's gravity so how can it be weak?

  
I'm not saying he's wrong, I just don't understand.

Text: From what I understand, there are 'two' major threats posed to the ocean, which can both be directly attributed to global warming, but for two different reasons. Ocean acidification as a result of rising co2 emissions, meaning more carbon in the atmosphere, which dissolves in seawater and creates a higher carbon content, thus leading to a lower pH level and increased acidity. More acidity creates a multitude of problems, with coral bleaching, danger posed to calcifying organisms no longer able to create shells, and other larger impacts on the marine ecosystem in general.

What I'm confused about, however, is warming of the ocean that isn't directly due to acidification (in terms of a higher co2 content), and instead, an increase in the oceans temperatures due to it trapping more excess heat than it can hold. Is this actually even a phenomenon or is ocean warming strictly due to an increase in emissions?

I'm operating under the following knowledge, I do hope at least my base knowledge is correct. As I understand it a radio channel is nothing more than a different width of the radio-wave. And the way an old school radio worked was actually just 'tapping' into a different length of the radio's antenna to match the radio wave width that corresponds with the station i turned to.

I operated under that knowledge for the better part of 30 years until I learned that the FM radio waves are over 10 feet wide (3.3m) half an hour ago. I've never had any radio with that size of an antenna, which leads me to believe I don't actually know how radios work. Where am I going wrong?

Text: First, Sorry for my bad english as french is my first language.


Recently i have been bitten by a stray dog, and after going to the hospital they gave me both the vaccine and the antibodies by injection at the same time.


The emergencies were very busy so i didn't have time to ask the physician about it.


But i don't understand, isn't it useless to give me the vaccine at the same time as the antibodies ?, the antibodies will just attack the vaccine and make it useless.



We learned at school that we have to wait after the birth of a baby to give him vaccines because the maternal antibodies will attack the vaccine and make it useless.



So why the same logic isn't apply here ? i don't understand, can someone explain to me please.

Text: I've always heard that women are born with all the eggs they'll ever have, and I (24F) assumed that that meant like..... 500 eggs? Because there's 1 per menstrual cycle for 40ish years. 

I feel very silly now because apparently female fetuses have MILLIONS of eggs and we lose them over time. From what I'm reading, girls are born with around 1-2 million, and then by puberty have around 300,000-400,000 left, and then post-puberty about 1,000/month die. 

My question is: what actually happens to the cells? Every written-for-laypeople article that I can find just says that X amount of immature eggs die per month, but where do the cells go? Do they stay dead in the ovary? Are they shedded as part of menstruation? Or do they get broken down and reabsorbed into the body somehow... (?) 

Thanks for helping! Everything I can easily find online is either a pop-science article that skims over this question or a super technical description that means nothing to me.

Text: As I understand it, when water is heated, it evaporates into colourless/invisible gaseous water, then the gas is cooled by atmospheric temperature and recondenses as visible liquid water droplets, which we see as a cloud of steam.

In the case of liquid nitrogen, I assume it undergoes a similar process - it heats up and evaporates into colourless invisible gas phase .  Why then do we see a visible fog forming?  How does the nitrogen cool back down enough to recondense into visible liquid droplets, considering its boiling point is in the negative hundreds of degrees C?

Text: Hello Reddit, I'm Dr David Spiegel. I'm Willson Professor and Associate Chair of Psychiatry &amp; Behavioral Sciences, and Director of the Center on Stress and Health and the Center for Integrative Medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine.

I have spent fifty years researching the impacts of hypnosis in a medical setting, treating over 5,000 patients. I have published thirteen books and 425 scientific journal articles on hypnosis, psychosocial oncology, trauma, psychotherapy for stress, anxiety, and depression. The results we have been documenting with hypnosis in relation to a wide range of challenges - like healing pain, overcoming trauma, maximising productivity, managing eating habits, quitting smoking, and going sober - are incredible. I truly believe that if hypnosis were a drug, we'd see it across every hospital in the US.

I'm here today to demystify and dispel some of the rumours and myths around hypnosis, showing how incredible and valuable hypnosis is as a tool for significant change. AMA about [cyclic sighing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYYLZA3-VRI), [hypnotizability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8fPExRLX2s), [managing chronic pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYYLZA3-VRI), stress, and neuroscience. I'm equally happy to share insights on any other topics I've mentioned above.

I am also working with a wonderful team to build our app, Reveri, where we share the transformative effects of hypnosis with users around the world. The feedback and data we're receiving from our app matches with the impact and results seen with in-person hypnotherapy. If you'd like to try self-hypnosis, you can [download Reveri here](https://linktr.ee/reverihealth).

(To save everyone a question, no, [I'm not this Dr Spiegel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IwUlKPSVQs&amp;pp=ygULZHIgc3BpZWdlbCA%3D).)

I'll be replying to questions on today starting at 10am PST / 1pm EST / 6pm BST

Text: I was on a Wikipedia reading about Socotra Island, and after clicking more hyperlinks than I can remember, somehow ended up on the page for the Congo River. It is claimed the Congo is the deepest river in the world, at 720 feet. Out of curiosity o googled the depths of various other rivers, the Amazon, Mississippi, Missouri, and Columbia Rivers. Once I googled the Columbia River, the top featured snippet was from Wikipedia, which claimed “Water depths have been estimated at 1,000 ft at Wallula Gap and 400 ft over modern Portland, Oregon.” I then researched further and found on usgs dot gov “Depths to 300 feet have been measured near the Dallas, Oregon.” 

I then searched for the deepest river in the US, and was met with every single site (though none reliable like USGS) claiming the Hudson River is the deepest river in the US, with a maximum depth of 216 feet.

So what is it? Is the Congo the deepest river in the world at 720 feet or is it actually the Columbia River at 1,000 feet? Is the deepest river in the US the Hudson River at 216 feet? Or is it the Columbia at 1,000 or 300 feet? Or do we not actually know the answers?

Text: Radio astronomer here! Many of you may already know me by my user name, /u/Andromeda321, which I've used for many years now to drop astronomy/space facts, or give context on new space discoveries in science. In the real world, my name is Yvette Cendes, and I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Next summer, however, I will begin as an assistant professor of physics at the University of Oregon, where I will focus on building the department's astronomy course and research offerings- go ducks!

Radio astronomy is a powerful tool to learn more about our cosmos- different physical processes emit light at different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, and radio waves can often reveal information you can't learn from other wavelengths. My particular specialty are &quot;transient&quot; signals- ones that turn on and off over time, instead of being constant (like most things in the universe are during the course of our lifetime). This has covered a huge range of phenomena, and certainly keeps things exciting- during my career I have studied things such as supernovae, potential radio emission from exoplanets (which would be generated by the planet's magnetosphere), and even the closest black holes we know of to Earth!

Most recently, however, I have focused most of my research on &quot;burping&quot; black holes- a new and unexpected phenomenon in black hole physics. This occurs years after a star wanders too close to a supermassive black hole, and is torn apart by tidal forces, in an event known as a Tidal Disruption Event (TDE). Outflows from these events generate radio emission, and was traditionally thought to occur only in the first ~months post-disruption, but my team has discovered an astounding ~40% of TDEs will have detectable radio emission *years* post-disruption that don't at early times! This is incredibly exciting because it opens a new door to studying black hole physics- you can read a recent news article about this discovery [here](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7e4bb/a-wild-and-mysterious-discovery-just-upended-our-idea-of-black-holes), and a much more detailed summary of our preprint paper [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Andromeda321/comments/164n35e/i_have_discovered_that_up_to_half_of_all_black/). Additionally, last year I discovered that one of these &quot;burping&quot; black holes has an outflow with a velocity up to half the speed of light, [known as AT2018hyz, or &quot;Jetty McJetface.&quot;](https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/black-hole-belches-out-remnants-of-gobbled-star-years-after-initial-meal/)

When not doing research or hanging out around Reddit, I am also involved in outreach, writing for publications like *Astronomy* magazine and serving as the astronomy editor for the *Guinness Book of World Records*. I also maintain an active subreddit at /r/Andromeda321, and maintain a [Twitter/X account](https://twitter.com/whereisyvette) (though don't post much there any more) and a much more active one at BluSky [@whereisyvette.bsky.social](https://staging.bsky.app/profile/whereisyvette.bsky.social). I enjoy a lot of [astronomy cross stitch](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/10ijfdq/i_cross_stitched_the_carina_nebula_one_of_the/) too!

Anyway, please post any questions you have about my research, astro outreach on Reddit, or anything else that comes to mind! I'll be stopping by at **noon EDT (16 UT)** to answer questions!

I know that a lot of the animals which prey on horseshoe crabs are also animals which have been around for a long time like sharks, turtles, and alligators but I'm just using them as an example. 



Alternatively, would say a species of shark which used to feed on a type of fish which went extinct millions of years ago still pursue it as prey if that shark encountered one today?

Text: Hello!  
I was looking into how sea ice and snowfall changes over the course of the year, but I came across something that I am interested in. How come the western coast of North America (Alaska-Oregon) not freeze in the same way as other places of similar latitude, such as the Sea of Okhotsk in the Russian Far East. One can clearly observe the land freezing in the region, but the sea near to Alaska remains relatively unfrozen in comparison to other places like the Hudson Bay. I understand that the same reason Europe is warmer in winter is due to the Gulf Stream, is there something similar at work here? Thanks!

Text: [This video shows a quantum simulation made by solving the Schrödinger equation for a particle scattering in three different lattices.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kXGb0_-1iY)

Initially, the particle seems sensible - it's a packet of waves that behaves like a particle in the aggregate. But once it starts scattering, nothing makes sense to me anymore.

1. It is my understanding that particles are discrete - you can't have half a photon. But in this simulation, the scattering pushes half of it through the lattice and half reflects backwards!

2. Scattering seems to disperse the energy of the particle over a large (and infinitely expanding) area of space. Is the particle destroyed after this? I didn't think particles could be destroyed. 

3. What would happen if you observed this particle after the scattering? Would all these waves collapse into a single discrete particle again? How does this process work?

Text: As the former Acting Surgeon General of California and the Office's inaugural Chief Health Officer, I was a key public health spokesperson and advisor to the California Governor, and I led statewide policy and practice innovation to reimagine how we address trauma, stress and health.

While serving in this role, I publicly shared my own journey with bipolar disorder to help dispel stigma and internalized shame, and to spread hope and light - pursuits I continue to prioritize.

I previously served on Stanford's faculty as a pediatrician and conducted gender, mental health, and health equity research. My areas of expertise are: trauma-informed systems, stress and resilience, gender and health equity, and child health. Now, I advise entities that aim to advance resilience or equity. This includes serving on the national Board of Directors for the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI).

I spent my early years between the Philippines, India and the US; I'm an immigrant and a first-generation American. I'm also raising a sweetheart of a toddler with my partner of 17 years, while living nomadically - a fun and action-packed journey.

Today, I'm partnering with Number Story to raise awareness around how early adversity and stress can impact our health and well-being - and more importantly, to share tools and strategies for preventing and reversing these impacts.

By that definition, isn't the protoplasm just the cell? at least in a cell without a cell wall that description includes every single part of a cell, so what's even the point of the word protoplasm? I also keep seeing it described as colourless when I thought nuclei were little black dots or something. Maybe those were just stains used to colour the nuclei for microscopy videos

Learning that trans genus trans family and sometimes trans order hybrids were possible blew my mind, and left me with difficult questions about how and why we classify animals. To keep it simple I’ll stick with this one: what makes Neanderthals a different species? Is it genetic? Behavioral? Is it because of how long ago we branched?

Now that's just a scientist's guess when they gather info about the exoplanet, but like with Coral reefs being visible from space, can the same be possible from, let's say footages of these planets? Like, zooming on the footage and observing the oceans from there?

However, I'm aware that if those planets had something similar like Coral reefs here, we could identify alien life already. To simplify the question, if we find an alien planet with oceans, would it be likely that we could find some visible life activity from space footage, similar to coral reefs on Earth? Or it isn't a good analogy?

Text: If I am walking 5km/h in a train that is moving 100km/h I'm really moving 105km/h relative to the earth. But the earth is moving 107,000 km/h relative to the sun so in a way I'm moving 107105km/h. But our solar system is moving 200,000km/s through the milky way so add that also... etc, etc etc.  
Now I realize that the speed of light is the fastest anything can move. And I know that time changes depending on the speed you are going. But I have also been led to believe that the object that is moving at great speed is experiencing time slower than those moving slower, yet to the object itself time still seems to move the same while the outside world form its perspective seems to speed up.

  
1. Since speed is relative and there is no fixed point to use as a speed of zero, if a planet was already moving at near light speed relative to another point in space how would its inhabitants even know that they were moving that fast?

  
2. If I, along with my world, was already moving this fast would my interpretation of light speed still just be an additional 300,000km/s relative to me?

  
3. What does this mean for the passage of time on other planets that are moving at a different speed through the universe relative to Earth?

Text: I'm sorry if this has been asked before, I searched on Reddit and Google and could not find this question asked.

If two stationary balls are in a box which has a complete vacuum in deep space, ignoring the gravity of the balls for each other, the balls will just sit in the same spots forever.

However if the balls in the vacuum in the box were freefalling in an orbit around the earth, because the balls independently have elliptical orbits around the earth, they should move towards each other and then away from each other, oscillating back and forth.

Wouldn't this distinguish the first and second scenarios and thus violate Einstein's Equivalence principle? Thanks.

Also, I asked this in /r/physics, but they kept removing it for some reason and would not explain why.

Text: I understand that lines of longitude converge at the poles, but why were they made to do that when lines of latitude run parallel to each other? 

Or maybe what I want to know is, why don’t we have another set of lines that run north and south but remain parallel to each other? 

I think I can understand why you don’t need converging lines that run east to west, but if parallel lines are helpful running east and west, wouldn’t they be helpful running north and south too?

Edit: Apologies that this is so unclear, it was very hard to find the wording to convey my question. Maybe what I should have asked is, why is it helpful to  measure latitudinally using nearly cylindrical parallel divisions, where we measure the earth longitudinally in converging divisions that make a shape like an orange carpel (again, I am running out of words here).

Second Edit: CrustalTrudger helped me understand that the lines of longitude and latitude were defined as they were primarily because of their relation to the sun and the poles and their usefulness in navigation. The lines of longitude are not just measuring the difference between places on the earth, but  instead are something like tracking the places which are directly under the sun at the same time. This would have been more practical at the time than covering the globe in a grid of arbitrary parallel lines. The latitudinal lines are even distances from the equator which has significance in relation to both the sun and the poles.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural\_nuclear\_fission\_reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_nuclear_fission_reactor)

Which happens to be in the same location (Gabon, Africa) where (supposedly) the oldest known multicellular organisms have been found: 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francevillian\_biota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francevillian_biota)

Also the timing roughtly matches up (1.7billion years - 2 billion years ago)

While this is probably a coincidence, I'm still curious,  is there any research on the impact of radiation on the evolution of early life?

Text: I know enough of evolution to know its a very gradual process of &quot;steps&quot;. Benefical traits in context of an organisms day to day survival and reproduction tend to slowly accumulate over time whilst detimental traits to that tend to be removed. How does a process, like this lead to such complex engineering instincts? A lot must go into building a damn for starters location, how do they know an ideal spot to build a dam? How do they decide the exact spot to construct? How can they so expertly engineer their own enviroment to that extent? What was the spesific evolutionary &quot;path&quot; that was took that made a small aquatic mammal so adept and hydroengineering?

In a sense im confused as how evolution a process of &quot;Eh good enough&quot; changes spesifically creates such a complex behavior as dam building? Like what were the beneficial steps that lead to it? Presumably there had to be, or beavers wouldn't be doing this?

Text: I've recently grown fascinated with the Galilean Moons, the four big moons orbiting Jupiter. While scrolling their Wikipedia pages I found a part of it that said that they may have been discovered almost 2000 years earlier than previously thought, seeming to suggest that a Chinese astronomer by the name of Gan De had seen &quot;a small reddish star appended to its side&quot;, and had directly observed one of  them. None of the moons are red so this probably wasn't one of them in my opinion, but it did get me thinking as to whether or not this would even be possible. It's not ludicrous - the brightest of them, Ganymede, has an apparent magnitude of 4.6, bright enough to be visible to the naked eye, but it is also possible that they would be obscured by the glare of their parent planet. So would it be possible to view the moons of Jupiter with just your naked eye?

So far, my understanding is that our eyes convert energy from the environment (transduction) and this beautiful electrical, chemical dance happens within us to give us what we perceive.

However, I also just read that simply having a memory of a particular object can fire the SAME neurons as when we actually see that object. Where are those memory-influenced neurons getting their energy from?

I also understand some neurons are self-excitable, but aren't those for more involuntary processes like heartrate? 

The brain is incredible!

Is there any pattern to this that we can detect? For example, are the galaxies in certain galactic clusters oriented in a similar way? Or is orientation just random?

If it's not random, does that tell us anything about the initial conditions of the universe (angular momentum, for example)?

Text: I thought about this while walking my dog today and had no idea which answer is correct. I'd assume that most scientific tools could only measure a Photon's velocity, especially when the speed of light was first discovered in the Michelson-Morley experiment, but if that was the case wouldn't the oscillation of a photon provide a small incremental boost to the overall speed of the photon? But if the speed of light does account for the oscillation then wouldn't the distance that light travels be less than it's overall speed?

I'm not sure what the answer to my question is, more than likely it's nonsense haha. Would love to be informed.

Text: Hello, so, I've noticed that in the past, for narrowband (up to 5Khz sound) analogue voice transmission the radio frequencies used were in the hundreds of Khz up several Mhz, wideband sound (FM radio) uses frequences of tens to hundreds of Mhz and modern digital wireless transmission uses radio waves in the Ghz range, with 5G FR2 going into the tens of Ghz range. The trend is clear - more modern methods of wireless communication use higher frequency waves, with less range.

Am I correct in assuming this is because at high frequencies, even if you only occupy a small portion of the frequency you still got a huge bandwidth? And using the traditional Long Wave, Medium Wave and Short Wave frequencies, just how good of a bitrate could be achieved if instead of transmitting sound a digital mode using all advances in modern technology (most modern modulation etc.) are used? I did read a bit about packet radio but I don't think hobbyist packet radio represents the absolute best possible given that it often uses decades old, straightforward technology.

In Sri Lankan historical sources, as far as I know,
all the contact between Sri Lanka and Indian

means. Sri Lanka was always considered an island
and there is evidence to suggest that they were
connected by a land bridge in pre historic times.

Text: Hi Reddit! We are biologists from the University of Maryland here to answer all of your bat-related questions.

**[Gerald (Jerry) Wilkinson](https://biology.umd.edu/people/gerald-wilkinson)** is a professor in the University of Maryland Department of Biology who conducts research on social behavior, with emphasis on how genetic mechanisms may influence the outcome of evolution. He has studied several species of bats, including vampire bats, in the Neotropics and the US to understand cooperative behavior and communication. Recently, his lab has used DNA methylation to predict age in bats and discovered that extreme longevity, which has evolved in multiple bat lineages, is associated with changes in methylation near genes involved in immunity. Current projects aim to identify epigenetic changes associated with social stress, immune function, and sex differences in aging in bats.

**Katherine Armenta** is a third-year Ph.D. student in the University of Maryland Behavior, Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics program (BEES).

Text: With the exception of the Mohawk &amp; Champlain valleys, the mountainous valleys here on the eastern half of the country are typically thin and narrow with a river or stream surrounded on both sides by forested mountains and hills with maybe a thin strip of flat land with a small village or town on the banks of the river usually connected by one or two roads along either side of the river and maybe a rail line slowly meandering along the sharp and winding curves of the valley. By contrast from what I’ve seen the Rockies and Western Ranges seem to be dominated by wide expansive open valleys filled with dry grassland and prairie or at least they seem to be far more common than they are here in the East. Which seems counterintuitive as since the Appalachians are much older you’d expect erosion to widen the valleys as the rock nearer to the tops of the mountains would erode quicker than those at the bottom smoothing out the slope and increasing deposition of sediment at the bottom expanding the distances between both the starts and peaks of mountains and creating wider valleys? Why is this?

Text: It has been a long time since I have taken physics, but I believe my question essentially boils down to can a planet rotate around two different axes such that the north pole is always tilted towards the star? I understand that seasons are caused by the tilt of the earth causing the North hemisphere to receive more sunlight than the south hemisphere for half a year and vice versa. Would it be possible for a planet to orbit a star in a way that the axis is always leaning towards the sun? I believe this would mean that the planet is orbiting around one axis (such as north and south poles) as well as another axis perpendicular to the plane of the orbit allowing the north pole to always be angled towards the sun. Would the axis of the north and south poles have to intersect with the star for this to be achieved, or could the angle of the axis be angled above or below the star?

Hopefully I explained that well enough for you to understand.

That got me thinking about present day carbon sequestration efforts and silicate weathering, and my question is: *in the years and decades following the impact, as the silicate dust settled out into land and shallow seas, and got rained on on land, did it chemically sequester enough CO₂ to affect the climate?*

Text: for context my background is a single course of QM.

i read that the fine structure is cause by corrections due to relativistic considerations (along with spin contribution).

here's my issue: arent the electrons in the atomic structure standing waves? as in, they are not propagating, so there is no relative velocity between them and the frame of reference (the nucleus).

my understanding is that the electrons can't be moving because if they were then they'd be radiating due to moving through the nucleus' E-field, which they aren't. not to mention if they ARE in motion then they're also all moving relative to each other's E-field in a multi-e system.

so how can bound electrons both be stationary waves and at the same time require relativistic corrections? what exactly is behaving &quot;relativistically&quot; in this system?

Text: Hello, everyone, this is a weird question but it's one that has been going around in my head for a few days and I dont know how to answer. For context I was thinking about lightspeed and how its impossible to go faster than it but I got this idea into my head and I can't get it out.

Imagine a Seesaw floating in outer space, the &quot;plank&quot; is perfectly rigid and the plank its 2 lightseconds long. If I were to push down on one end of the seesaw, would the other end go up 2 seconds later or would it start moving at the same time? (asuming that the center doesnt move down when you push it down).  Also, what would happen if I just push the whole seesaw from the center down, would ends of it go down at the same time or would they go down a second later?

I don't understand enough to actually come up with an answer, so if someone could help me understand this, provably stupid question, that would be amazing.

Thanks!

Edit: First of all thank you to everyone that answered this, some of it goes over my head but I feel like I have learned a lot, so thank you everyone who took the time to answer my question.

Second, just to dispel a misconception, I asked this question out of ignorance not as a gotcha to relativity or to just make stuff up. I was not aware that a perfectly rigid object was such an impossibility that it breaks physics, in my ignorance I thought that saying perfectly rigid was akin to disregarding friction in an equation to makes things simpler. I now understand that that was VERY dumb of me, so sorry about that. But hey I learned something new so thanks everyone.  

After reading everything I now understand that i should have said something like maximum possible rigidity for my thought experiment, which was poorly worded because I just didn't know any better so sorry about that.

Text: Preface: I only have high school / freshman level scientific knowledge of chemistry, but I have a stronger background in Physics (several higher level classes in university)

In high school chemistry we are given the knowledge and run on the assumption that electrons are solid objects orbiting various levels of energy from the nucleus, and things like donating electrons in ionic bonding and covalent bonding is the sharing of valence electrons to allow both atoms to reach the maximum number of electrons in a certain shell.

Once I got to slightly more advanced physics and understood the wave-particle behavior of electrons, I cannot make the link between how the bonding works when the concept of an electron can now be described as a field. Does it just bypass this entire concept together, only interacting as the particle section of the wave-particle duality?

Most of the documentation I've read is often too hard for me to piece together, so any help would be appreciated.

Text: I started a new batch of mead relying on the yeast naturally occurring in raw honey. At this stage I'm regularly stirring the batch to introduce oxygen for yeast growth. Using an electric whisk to oxygenate creates a lot of bubbles, nearly a foam, on the top. I'm wondering how this impacts the exange of oxygen to yeast in the mixture? What passes along the 'skin' of a bubble? Is it a static structure until it pops or do sugar and water molecules flow along the surface? And if those things do flow, do yeast cells travel along the surface? 

Side notes for those interested. After the yeast peaks in activity it will move to an air locked environment to encourage alcohol production and give time for the yeast to break down the fructose, which takes longer. The source of my knowledge is coming from The Art of Fermentation by Sandor Ellix Katz. This isn't the first time following this method and harmful contamination risks are pretty low and very detectable.

This is also a small, hobby amount and the question is really a curiosity about the structure of bubbles. Don't really care about making perfect mead or I'd post this question elsewhere.

Text: 
What’s happening on a molecular level? I don’t do well with abstract thought so I’ll provide an “experiment” and hopefully someone clever can explain it to me.

Say I have two dry kidney beans. I put one on a sunny windowsill on a hot day and I put the other one in the freezer. An hour later, I take both beans and put them side by side on a plate on the kitchen table. After some time, they both return to room temperature. 

My questions are numbered but you don’t have to answer them directly like this, it just makes it easier for me:

1. If I put the beans under a super strong microscope that could show me the molecules (or whatever level we’d have to be observing to see what we want to see) while they were still hot/cold, how could I recognize by observation alone which one was hot and which one was cold?

2. What would the molecules in each bean do as it cooled/warmed up, respectively?

3. If the beans on the plate existed in a small vacuum universe, just big enough for the beans and a few cubic inches of air around them, how would their respective temperatures effect each other or the air as their temperature equalized? Would you be able to see the air around the hot bean heat up as the hot bean itself cools down, and what would that look like?

4. What causes temperature to equalize (why do hot things cool down, why do cold things warm up?)

High school was a long time ago and I never took physics anyway. So feel free to keep it simple lol

Text: I do not come from a science background but I did take it in high school. I know that curly hair is a dominant gene but I always wondered specifically about hair types. Let’s say a male who has 4c (very kinky hair) and female who has 4c hair have a kid. Will that kid have 4c hair? Does whatever type of curl pattern the parents have determine the type of curl pattern their child has? Like since they both have the same hair will their child have their hair or is it a chance they could have a different curl pattern? So sorry because this might be an obvious answer but I do not come from a science background. TIA.

Electrons have a magnetic dipole moment. If a permanent magnet was held against one end of a copper rod, the delocalised electrons close to the magnet would be attracted and concentrate around the magnetic pole.

This should result in the creation of a weak electret because the electret because of the uneven electron distribution.

That said, air resistance and available atmospheric oxygen decrease with elevation.

Is there any scientific support to the claim that what the mother eats affects breast milk, e.g. the claim that bloating foods that the mother eats may lead to bloating in the child, etc.

How far am I actually looking? 
A+B? 
B-A?
A?
B?
Something else? 

To add a practical example. I can only read a sign from 5m away when staring directly at it, any further away and I can’t read it. If that sign is placed 6m from a mirror (B) and I look at the mirror from 2m away (A), would I be able to read the sign? 

Additionally, if the sign is placed 2m from the mirror (B) and I stand behind it so I am 5m from the mirror (A), could I still read the sign? 

Assuming it’s a flat mirror and I’m not obstructing the view to the object/ sign.

Text: Hi everyone! We are the producers of the documentary miniseries [*Spy in the Ocean*](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/collections/spy-in-the-ocean/). For this installment we created more than 30 realistic animatronic spy creatures to explore the seas and capture never-before-seen animal behavior. The Spies we created include a whale calf (our biggest yet!), shark, dolphin, manatee, cuttlefish, octopus, seal, crab and many more. Utilizing the latest subsea technology, these robot lookalikes ventured to the depths of the ocean floor to interact with their animal counterparts, communicating with them and mimicking their patterns. We're happy to answer your questions about how these robots work, what we discovered, and more!

*Spy in the Ocean* is currently airing on PBS on Wednesdays at 8/7c (check local listings). You can watch the first two episodes now at [pbs.org](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/collections/spy-in-the-ocean/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvxs_j5q540bdPfHEZXOD6O5C1NntHdid), or on the [PBS App](https://www.pbs.org/pbs-app/).

If you're in the UK, you can watch the whole series on the [BBC iPlayer](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m001mp1b/spy-in-the-ocean).

Answering questions at **11 am ET / 4 pm UK** will be:

+ **Matthew Gordon**, series producer. Matthew has been working in the wildlife film industry for over 20 years. Before entering the film industry, Matthew received a BSc degree in Biology and an MSc in Palaeobiology from the University of Bristol. He specialized in human evolution and primatology and worked in various environments from the rainforests of Madagascar to the deserts of Arizona. He then started his career at John Downer Productions in the edit suite, cutting sequences for BBC/Discovery programs like *Tiger - Spy in the Jungle* and *Swarm*. For the first two series of *Spy in the Wild*, he spent 6 years working across the world from filming orangutans in the jungles of Borneo to sea otters in Alaska. For *Spy in the Ocean*, Matthew fulfilled a lifelong dream to film humpback whales in French Polynesia and a 'megapod' of spinner dolphins in Costa Rica.
+ **Huw Williams**, series producer. Huw studied at Aberystwyth University where he got his BSc in Zoology before joining John Downer Productions in 2009, when he first started working on *Earthflight/Winged Planet* and *Polar Bear Spy on the Ice*. From filming wolves in the Artic to sea snakes in the ocean depths of Indonesia, Huw has been fortunate to gain many experiences while filming wildlife around the world. *Spy in the Ocean* highlights for Huw include diving with giant shoals of hammerhead sharks, working on getting the spy hammerhead into the heart of the shoal, and filming the spy cuttlefish as it communicated with an amorous cuttlefish looking for a mate.
+ **Philip Dalton**, executive producer. Philip has a BSc degree in Environmental Biology and his wildlife filmmaking career spans over 25 years. He started out at the BBC Natural History Unit before moving onto IMAX productions, eventually landing with John Downer Productions. His programs have collected numerous awards from the Royal Television Society, Wildscreen and more, along with an EMMY for Best Cinematography for *Winged Planet*. Philip is instrumental in developing and operating the specialist camera devices used on the *Spy* films, shooting main camera for some of its most memorable sequences.

Text: So there's a train of thought here and I'm sorry if I ramble, but I'm not sure how to actually explain what I want to know very well or I'd just Google it myself.

So I've been watching deep sea documentary videos. And they say Challenger Deep is 12000 meters down and almost freezing. But the furthest down we've been able to drill is 11000 meters, and as far as I understand it, the heat was the biggest obstacle preventing going further. Plus unless I'm just misunderstanding everything, shouldn't higher pressures increase temperature? 

So how is the deepest depths not hotter than a couple degrees? My first thought was the hot water would rise and cooler water would come down to take it's place, but that would cause like constant sideways tornadoes of water. So I searched if vertical currents were a thing. I found upwellings and downwellings. But most of what I could find was related to shallower water nearer the coast. 

So yeah, I'm probably missing and misunderstanding alot, but this has been in my head for like a week. Appreciate any answers!

Text: There is a general consensus that agriculture started in Fertile Crescent around 12 thousand years ago, later independently in other regions around &quot;middle latitudes&quot; such as China and Mesoamerica. People usually focus on the timing but my question is why it started roughly in middle latitudes? 

Today most fertile lands (mollisols) are located in Canada and Eurasian prairies but as far as we know, these are not where Neolithic Revolution first took place. Was there more important factors for progenitors of first domesticated plants, such as growing season suitability, population density, paleolithic tools etc., or when Holocene started, these middle latitude regions had mollisols already but later lost their fertility? 

I assume complex interplay of different factors are offered by different scholars without a consensus but any answer or suggestion for academic publication is welcome.

To this day, despite being present in much of the food we consume, many people will swear blind that MSG causes them a variety of symptoms, such as rapid heart rate and sweating.

Imagine a room with a living person and someone who has recently died (a little over 1 hour), and a forensic scientist arrives blindfolded (with all the testing equipment he may need). If I draw blood from either the living person or the recently deceased and give it to the scientist, will he be able to tell where the blood came from based on the &quot;freshness&quot;?

Thank you in advance.

Text: Hi, I was wondering if it is possible (even theoretically) to build a device orbiting earth that could observe the surface of the planets in other star systems like we can observe planets in our system. Or maybe is it impossible for example because of not enough light reflected is reaching the earth from these planets so no chance to achieve good image even if we catch all the photons?

Could it be they drifted keeping the same exact (or almost exact) sea level ?

Text: Hi Reddit! This is Tiffany from Bloomberg and I am joined by Dr. Philippe Grandjean of Southern Denmark University here. In a new documentary, I interviewed Dr. Grandjean on how substances known as PFAS, or &quot;forever chemicals,&quot; found their way to every corner of the planet-and the consequences.

You can watch it here: https://youtu.be/t8qGtEVh7oQ?si=QNjv4-IorQrCtpL4

PFAS are used in hundreds of everyday products-from fabric protectors, electronics and non-stick pans to foams, tapes and even toilet paper. PFAS are called &quot;forever chemicals&quot; because the properties that make them so useful to consumers make them very persistent in the environment.

In the Bloomberg Originals video documentary The Poison In Us All, we reveal how the chemicals - which have been linked to cancer and are the subject of sweeping litigation - ended up inside the bodies of almost everyone on the planet.

Litigation has revealed documents showing that its manufacturers, including industrial giant 3M, had dumped the chemicals for years and have been aware of the dangers associated with PFAS. 3M has said its products &quot;are safe and effective for their intended uses&quot; and assailed plaintiffs' lawyers for selectively citing documents to portray &quot;an incomplete and misleading story about 3M's actions.&quot;

We'll be on at **1pm ET (18 UT)**, ask me and Dr. Grandjean any questions you have about PFAS here!

Text: Hello I'm looking to settle an argument I've recently had with my buddies (who are all engineers) about the physics of a hypothetical race car in different gravitational environments. My hypothesis is that a car with all other factors the same including air density on a level plane will accelerate faster in slightly higher G environments than in slightly lower G environments. This hypothesis assumes that traction is a limiting factor of acceleration for this vehicle.

My reason for this hypothesis is that in higher G environments weight and therefore traction would increase but mass would remain unchanged. This would prevent the vehicle from spinning it's wheels off the line resulting in faster acceleration times than a lower G vehicle and since mass is unchanged it would have negligible impact on horizontal acceleration. They argue that since the vehicle would have more weight (not mass) it would be substantially slower. 

Could anybody help us out here? I'm sure I'm right and they're sure I'm stupid. An equation or links to other resources would be greatly appreciated!

The result that on our reference frame their particles are move slower on average on our perspective resulting a cooler than it really appears? compound with red shift caused by massive amount gravity light has to fight against when  leaving the star causing more red shifted appearance.

Do scientists account for these effect when they report their temperature and luminosity? Is the temperature listed on wiki their apparent temperature of their actual temperature?   

Also does neutron star get redder/dimmer as they get more heaver with more powerful time dilation effects?

Usually it's a pretty clear path between the Sahara and the Amazon rainforest, and I've always enjoyed watching large particulates traverse across our globe to feed this fascinating oxygenation cycle. 

But I've noticed this year when I go to watch this wonder occurring, the particulates are being diverted by the storms in the atlantic, and being drawn northwards, instead of over the Amazon rainforest. 

Are they being sunk into the ocean? What happens if the cycle is disrupted for too long?

Pretty much what it says on the tin: Is it possible for a reindeer to never grow antlers in its life? If so, why?  
Like, are there any genetic illnesses that might hinder antler growth? Any diseases they can catch that might attack the systems that make antlers grow or something? I'd expect any hypothetical lack of antlers to be due to Something Going Wrong because they seem pretty important, but is it at all possible for it to just be a rare genetic quirk or something?  
How badly might any of these hypothetical causes affect the animal? Could it live a mostly-normal life? Would it be sickly and weak? Would it just die in infancy or the womb? Something else?  
I'd just consult Google about this, but everything Google gives me is about how they shed their antlers every year. Which I already knew.  
Thank you in advance.

Text: After looking it up, I found out it is estimated that we do not have the remains of most, probably 99%, of the animals that existed a very long time ago in the past/prehistory, because fossilization is rare, meaning most animals do not fossilize but instead rot away or are destroyed by natural phenomena or disappear another way. On top of this, we have not dug very deep into most areas of the Earth, so we likely do not even have the remains of most animals which did fossilize.

But is there any way we could possibly figure out or guess how such creatures looked? Such as maybe by knowing what traits they needed to survive in the environments that existed during the times they lived or by potential parallels they could have had with other creatures that lived during the times when they were alive or any other way?

And at around 7:15 he said the readings of static pressure from the Static Ports have to be adjusted based on airspeed. But the pressure difference between the Pitot Tube reading and the Static Port reading is how the plane knows what its airspeed is in the first place, so how does it know what airspeed to use to adjust the static port readings?

Text: Demand for protein - especially meat, which takes by far the biggest toll on the environment - is soaring as the population grows, tastes change, and incomes fluctuate. As people around the world gather together for food-rich holidays, we wonder: **Can we feed this growing world without starving the planet?**

One possible solution is something you've probably seen in the news and around your social feeds recently: [cell-cultivated (aka 'lab-grown) chicken](https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/the-protein-problem/lab-grown-cultivated-meat/index.html), beef or even seafood. Do you think it could be part of future sustainable Thanksgiving meals?

Meat cultivated from cells - that doesn't require raising and killing animals - is starting to show up in a few restaurants in Singapore and the U.S. A recent poll from [The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research](https://apnews.com/article/can-meatless-mondays-help-environment-b09eaab6cbdce176debff415b48b1ec0) found that half of adults in the meat-hungry U.S. would be unlikely to try it. A majority of those who said they wouldn't said &quot;it just sounds weird.&quot; As part of a new series from AP, I explored whether cultivated meat, which some people call 'lab-grown' meat, could ever displace animal agriculture. And, as a vegetarian myself, I looked at what it would take to tempt consumers to try it.

Join [me](https://apnews.com/author/laura-ungar) (Laura Ungar), journalist [JoNel Aleccia](https://apnews.com/article/labgrown-chicken-cultivated-meat-863e7d68c8c4a5293683a7c5d6a58d15) - who covered the FDA approval for sales of cell-cultivated chicken in the U.S.- and [Claire Bomkamp](https://gfi.org/team/claire-bomkamp-ph-d/) - who is a lead scientist focused on cultivated meat and seafood at The Good Food Institute - at **2pm ET (19 UT)** for a conversation about the future of meat without animals.

Text: So im taking QM and learning about the pauli exclusion principle. Upon further digging, it seems that the reason two electrons can't be in the same position and state at the same time is because they(and all other particles of their class) are anti-symmetric. Meaning their wave functions are subtracted. Meaning the total wave function is zero.

Ok, but where does this come from?! lmao

The answers I found said its just taken as a theoretical definition. As in, its just assumed to be true in order for the equations to work. But is there some genuine deeper truth in quantum field theory, or is this just another one of those things we simply have no idea about? Like the origin of electron spin?

Assuming the above symptoms are accurate, is it truly that COVID19 is uniquely more damaging than the viruses that cause a &quot;common cold&quot; or the influenza viruses? Or has COVID19 just been studied far more rigorously as a brand new disease with global impact? I'm wondering if there are similar less acute impacts to being infected with influenza, etc. that we just don't really recognize.

I know the core's energy is mostly inacessible to humans, but the question does not ask whether it's acessible or not? I don't know if I'm missing something. Thanks.

The earliest universe was swirling mass of hydrogen and helium, and eventually those gases got close enough and heavy enough and compressed enough to make stars. And those stars made new stuff. And sometimes the stars exploded and that made entirely different stuff. This is a process that has been going on for a long while. 

Are today's stars only making the same elements that the universe already has? Or do we think that there are stars today also forging entirely new, different elements that we've never seen before?

Text: Sea level will likely rise. Oceans are storing a lot of CO2. So, would sea level affect ocean's capacity to store CO2 ? 

I mean, does ocean store CO2 because of the water itself? It's salt concentration ? Or because of the life in it (which may die)? 

And at the end of the day, would sea level rise be a good thing considering CO2 only ?

Text: I visited a zoo in Germany and it got me wondering as I observed the animals from around the world. Winter in on the doorstep. It's 0-5°C and there are leaves littering the grounds, including the pens, yet the savannan animals still roamed their outdoor pens.

I was wondering if animals instinctively know what habitat they belong to and if they might feel stressed because of that. Think of zebras and antelopes, for example. They didn't evolve in the temperate zones, yet now they get plenty of rain, cold weather, leaves everywhere, and totally different sounds and smells. 

Would the same species behave differently if they lived in a zoo in their own climate zone?

How do the grain size characteristics of channel bed deposits change as you move downstream along tectonically-active rivers?

I’m having trouble finding research on this. I want to know the difference between rivers that are tectonically active vs. that are not. It seems as though tectonics would have a significant impact on the entire river, but I don’t know how much that would specifically effect it downstream. 

I was hoping someone might be able to point me in the right direction because I don’t have any idea, or possibly provide any sort of papers that could help.

Text: Something doesn't add up when I look at the night sky. They say the moon and the sun appears the same size in the sky, because the sun is 400x further away from us, but also 400x bigger. That makes sense to me. The diameter our eyes see on the sky is the same for the moon and the sun (which is why we can have total solar eclipses)

The nearest star to us is 268770 astronomical units away, which means it is 268770x further away from us than the sun. Other stars are even further away. But I can still see them. To me, they seem like dots in the sky. When I compare them to the size of the moon in the sky, they seem to be roughly 100 times smaller in my field of view. It's like taking a grain of sand and putting it next to a coin. Sure, it is much smaller, but certainly doesn't seem 268770x smaller at all. 

How can we even see a sun-sized star that is 268770x further away from us? Even as a dot in our field of view, that seems like WAY too big relative to the sun/moon's size (maybe 100x smaller only). So to me, this doesn't make sense. I failed to find an answer to this on google. Can anyone explain how?

Text: Lions, obviously, come from the savannah, so they adapted to live in the heat, and not so much the cold. I know lions are quite comfortable during the winter in zoos, even in places that get super cold, but I have to imageine that's at least partially due to the zookeepers taking care of them. Heated rocks to lie on, heated indoor enclosures to go into if needed, abundant food and no need to hunt, etc.

But what if a bunch of lions from the zoo were to escape into the wild in an area that had below-freezing winters (and they didn't get any additional help from humans). Could they survive the winter?

And if yes, what's the coldest winter they could likely survive all on their own? Like imagine if humans just all up and vanished and the zoo lions got out. Could they survive the winter if they were in an area that saw winters getting down to 10 dehrees fahrenheit? 0 fahrenheit? -10? -20? What's the coldest they could realistically survive all on their own?

Text: Hello everyone. I was thinking about that question for some time and I think that it keeps traveling but I can be wrong. Let me explain what I mean: lets suppost that in a cold day you put the heater on and you open the window. The heat escapes through the window. The temp outside is 32°F / 0°C and inside is 80°F / 26°C. If you measure the air temperature (assuming that the winds are calm) outside close to the window, the temp is about 50°F / 10°C. As you go further and further, the temperature approaches 32F/0C. But, in a microscopic level, I was thinking if that heat keeps &quot;alive&quot; and &quot;travels&quot;, then in a really miniscule difference, say for example 32.0006°F / 0.0003°C (assuming that outside is exactly 32.0000000 / 0.0000000°C). Or does heat completely dies and therefore don't travel? Please, explain. Thank you.

Text: Hi Reddit! We are a group of scientists whose work entails weighing the world's climate pledges. Our aim is to not only understand whether the country-by-country climate commitments are sufficient to meet the world's warming goals, but to also assess the potential pathways we can take to realize those goals. By using one of the key models utilized by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we seek to understand what socioeconomic consequences could flow from the pathways on offer. With COP28 and the Global Stocktake starting in just two days, we wanted to answer any questions you have on the meeting and the global project of slowing climate change.

We hail mostly from the Joint Global Change Research Institute ([JGCRI](https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/jgcri)), a partnership institute between the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory ([PNNL](https://www.pnnl.gov/news)) and the University of Maryland (UMD). We are [Gokul Iyer (PNNL)](https://www.pnnl.gov/people/gokul-iyer), [Haewon McJeon (KAIST Graduate School of Green Growth)](https://kaist-iam.github.io/group/), [Yang Ou (Peking University)](http://scholar.pku.edu.cn/yangou/english), and [Yiyun 'Ryna' Cui (UMD)](https://cgs.umd.edu/our-community/faculty-staff/yiyun-ryna-cui).

In past work, we've shown that the world's climate pledges may be [enough to avoid the worst of global warming](https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/new-climate-pledges-if-fulfilled-now-significantly-more-likely-prevent-worst-global). Yet we are still [**not** on track for a 1.5-degree world](https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/world-will-probably-warm-beyond-15-degree-limit-peak-warming-can-be-curbed). Our most recent work points to [three major efforts](https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/how-slow-global-warming-three-widescale-efforts-could-make-difference) that could get us back there. How much carbon dioxide must we remove from Earth's atmosphere to meet our goals, and by when? What about greenhouse gasses other than carbon dioxide? Will planting trees really help? Should I stop eating beef? All fair questions, which we're happy to answer from **1-3pm PST (4-6 PM EST, 21:00 UTC)** today!

Text: I'm a junior chemistry major but I still haven't really had this explained.

The curve in an absorbance spectra, as opposed a straight line at an exact frequency, can be explained by the doppler effect. If light is absorbed in an orbital at X frequency and you shoot light with a frequency of 0.95 X at the orbital, if the molecule is moving towards the light source at a certain speed, the doppler effect will increase the effective frequency to X from the perspective. Works similarly if you shoot light with a frequency of 1.05 X and the molecule is moving away.

There's uncertainty in every measurement. When you measure a liter of water, you can say a liter, or be more precise, say 1.0 liters, and then 1.02 liters, 1.018 liters, etc. You can always get more and more precise. How do we deal with precision in the energy difference between electron configurations? The frequency of light needed to excite an electron configuration from the ground state to an excited state is in a molecule is often given in eV. If there's a difference of 3.21 eV between two configurations, and the light hitting the orbital has an energy of 3.21 eV, the orbital will absorb the energy and become excited. What if the difference between the configurations was really 3.214 eV, and it was hit by light with an energy of 3.213 eV? Would it still be absorbed? When is the difference too much?

I get that trajectories, and orbital dynamics etc are worked out with incredible precision, but in reality what's the margin of error?

Surely our measurements of the planets' mass can't be that accurate, not to mention the effects of nearby moons etc.

Text: Some background and then details on my specific case:

When people record live music, there's typically a few things they carry in their kit: 1) a microphone (in some cases a pair of electret mics), 2) a &quot;battery box&quot; which provides power to the mics and passes the signal through to a 3) recording device.  Most recording devices also have their own &quot;mic level&quot; power, but &quot;tapers&quot; highly recommend using a battery box and turning off the power from the recorder if possible.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are: what does a battery box do and is it really important in my setup described below?  Is there anything I can do to improve my design, like using different resistors - i.e., would 3-6K resistors (or even lower) be better?

In my case, I'm making my own &quot;battery box&quot; using info available online.  It basically has [this](https://i.imgur.com/SUswVO6.jpg) layout.  I am using a 12v (21/23) battery and 9.1K resistors, along with capacitors of sizes ranging from 22pF to 1uF (I've built several on the premise that the 22pF caps help provide bass roll-off, while the 1uF do not).  I kinda understand the purpose of the caps (at least in theory), but it's the resistors that I'm confused about, and ultimately how important the battery box is in this setup.

When measuring the inherent &quot;mic level&quot; output of my recorder (a Roland R-07), I see 2v and what looks like \~0.015ma.  This would directly feed the mics in the absence of a battery box.

With the battery box (12v battery + 9.1K resistors), I see 12v and \~0.10ma.

The electret mics I'm using typically have 2.2K impedance, require 1-10V, and use ~0.5mA max current.  A schematic of one set of mics I'm using is found [here](https://i.imgur.com/aibNo3C.jpg).  I've tried some prototypes of both the mics and the battery box out, and the recordings sound fine when recording volumes loud enough to require ear plugs - no clipping or anything, but I wonder what the resistors are doing and if the 9.1K ones I've chosen are the best for this application.

E: corrected some values. 

Thanks in advance for any help!

So, from my knowledge coal and oil are created from biological materials that were laying deep beneath ground and sea floor under high pressure and temperatures.

From that knowledge i figured that if at some point in history there was life on a planet then sooner or later coal and oil would be created.

But the thing is, that coal and oil are created in different circumstances, time frames(not sure about this one) and places.

So, is there a way for coal to be created but oil not at all or at the very least in very small numbers?

Text: So I just got into a huge argument with my boss, a MD at a cancer hospital in a developing country regarding hpv and cervical cancer. 

Allow me to paint the picture: we are working on a grant submission on communicable diseases. The focus is hpv prevention but she wants to focus on cervical cancer, bu I’m adamant that the grantor won’t even review our submission if it’s on cervical cancer. She says to just trust her and don’t argue with her because she’ll escalate it to the medical director and get me fired.

She claims that hpv is the same as cervical cancer as hpv is the major risk factor in 80% to 99.7% of all cases of cervical cancer. My argument is that they’re not the same. Preventing hpv through vaccination and educating patients on safe sex and contraceptive use is not the same as preventing cervical cancer. CDC says that it’s the major risk factor, but hpv infection does not mean a person has cervical cancer. I said that correlation does does mean causation and she says yes it does.

So here I am, on my last straw, on reddit at 6 am asking scientists: is hpv the same as cervical cancer?

Do surgeons take this into account when making incisions to avoid damaging their patient or causing any surgery complications? Do those tiny little cameras along with other imaging methods surgeons like to use help with these things?

Text: I read that muscle atrophy is the breakdown and shrinking of cells in muscles, which results in glycogen, water, and amino acids separating from the muscle cells. If that’s what happens, would they be used by the body in other processes as though someone had just eaten protein?

Text: I understand that intraplate faults can “absorb” (idk if that’s the right word but we’re rolling with it) stress and subsequently cause earthquakes, but does the fault move when that happens?

Like if you search up a diagram of an earthquake, you will see that one side of the fault will move, usually going up. Or both sides will move in opposite directions while still colliding (ie one going north and one going south)

But isn’t that only possible with interplate earthquakes? Because how can 2 sides of a fault be moving if there inside a tectonic plate?

Thanks for any and all responses!

Text: I was thinking about how trains stop, the engineer pulls a lever which releases air from the brakes, which makes the wheels slow down.

Intuitively longer trains take longer to stop because they have a lot more momentum, but obviously they also have more wheels and brakes. I'm guessing that a 100 car train will have the same &quot;brake to weight&quot; ratio as a 10 car train.

I read that the delay between the lever being pulled and the air being released toward the back of the train contribute to the braking distance. Before the last car even starts braking the train has already moved forward. 

But in a perfect system where all of the brakes are applied at the same time, would a train with 100 cars take longer to stop than one with 10 cars? Assuming each individual car has the same mass and braking force. After all if you had 100 semi trucks driving on a motorway and had them brake at the same time, they'd stop within the same distance as a single semi would. Is that the same for trains?

Text: So spontaneous synchronization is the idea that multiple oscillators that are physically connected in some way, can spontaneously synchronize their oscillations. 

My question is, is it possible to construct some system such that the random vibrations of molecules due to their thermal energy could spontaneously synchronize?  Could macroscopic movement arise from these microscopic thermal vibrations?

It feels like what I'm suggesting would violate the second law of thermodynamics,  but im not entirely sure about that.  As spontaneous synchronization of any oscillators also feels like it'd violate this law yet it obviously is real.

Perhaps it is possible, but only for sufficiently small systems?  I recall from a statistical mechanics class i took years ago that certain weird phenomena were actually possible for sufficiently small systems (such as a decrease in entropy for a small collection of particles, as the more orderly microstates were far more likely simply due to the number of permutations being much smaller)

Edit:  after seeing some comments I'd like to point out that I'm asking if *any* such material/structure could exist.  Obviously most everyday materials do not exhibit this behavior in anyway

They open the patient (or animal) up and they can kinda just pull the organs out without having to cut any fascia away or anything. Yet when I lie on my right side, I can still feel my heart beating on the left side of my chest, I still hear and feel my stomach gurgling and digesting right beneath my diagram and to the left. Even though gravity ought to be pulling those things down to the right side of my body when I'm lying on my right side. 


What's up with that? What's keeping those organs in place when every time I've seen footage of them in people and other animals it's like they're just kinda lying around in there.

While the majority of attention goes to anthropogenic contributions, one area that is gaining increased attention is the role of microorganisms in greenhouse gas cycles that are the main source of
climate change.

Join us today, December 12, with panelists coming in throughout the day, for an AMA presented by the American Society for Microbiology focused on microbes and biogeochemistry. We are experts in biogeochemistry from around the world who will answer your questions and discuss the role the world's smallest living organisms have in climate change contributions (and solutions). We'll discuss impacts of microbial metabolisms on the nitrogen cycle, contributions to methane production and consumption, and effects on levels of carbon dioxide. Ask us anything!

How do we know for example Iridium is from outer space... What was the line of investigation that lead to this firm agreed upon understanding, for any element / metal?

Text: Hello r/AskScience!

Joining us are Lucas Eastham, M.S., Priera Panescu, Ph.D., and Bryan Quoc Le, Ph.D., who are here to answer all your questions about upcycling agricultural &quot;leftovers&quot; for the production of alternative proteins.

**Upcycling sidestreams is a critical step toward creating circular bioeconomies that produce food more efficiently, affordably, and sustainably.** The [Good Food Institute](https://gfi.org/) (GFI), a nonprofit think tank working to make the global food system better for the planet, people, and animals, recently released a new report, &quot;[Cultivating alternative proteins from commodity crop sidestreams](https://gfi.org/resource/cultivating-alternative-proteins-from-commodity-crop-sidestreams/).&quot; Find the GFI Sidestreams analysis report [here](https://gfi.org/resource/cultivating-alternative-proteins-from-commodity-crop-sidestreams/) and webinar [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5HMeQzRU34).

The report identifies sidestreams (&quot;leftovers&quot;) that have tremendous potential to maximize food production via alternative proteins, while also reducing the costs and environmental impacts of agricultural waste. Specifically, this analysis identifies the optimal sidestreams candidates from North America's top crops that could be valorized for (1) protein concentrates for plant-based food ingredients, (2) protein hydrolysates for fermentation or cultivated meat media, and (3) lignocellulosic sugars for fermentation media.

This analysis highlights the major challenges associated with bringing these sidestreams into commercial use for the food industry. It also outlines strategic geographic opportunity areas and the need for public-private partnerships to fully exploit the economic and environmental potential sidestreams offer. Ultimately, the report aims to provide a landscape and actionable insights that commercial, non-profit, and public sector stakeholders can use to direct their efforts in building a sustainable, circular bioeconomy in the food industry.

[Lucas Eastham](https://gfi.org/team/lucas-eastham/) (/u/lucase-GFI) is a Senior Fermentation Scientist at The Good Food Institute, and previously worked for 10 years in microbial biotechnology bioprocess development for biofuels, biofertilizers, food ingredients, and cosmetic ingredients.

[Dr. Priera Panescu](https://gfi.org/team/priera-panescu/) (/u/Chemical_Preaction) is a Lead Scientist at The Good Food Institute.

Text: Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Biology, Chemistry, Neuroscience, Medicine, Psychology**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for 'X' were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;.

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed.

If you then wait 6 months, if the Earth rotates every 24 hours, then youd expect to be facing the same direction, but this time youd be facing directly away from the sun. Why is it that throughout the year, we dont have to take into account the orbit around the sun when calculating time?

Text: I wasn’t sure whether to tag this physics or chemistry. 

Hard to describe without a photo being allowed, but when pouring a liquid from one vessel to another, it seems that as the stream of liquid falls, it gets narrower. 

Refilling the hand wash dispenser from a bottle of refill, the higher I lift the refill bottle from the dispenser, the narrower the stream becomes (and the easier it is to get it into the filler hole).

As Professor Julius Sumner Miller would ask - “Why is it so?”

So let's say I had the common cold or whatever you think is the best scenario, and I get sick but as I'm getting better I infect a person in the store and I get better. They then pass it on and on and so forth. 

What is the possibility that you catch the same virus that you originally had, be it weeks, months later? 

Could a virus just have started with one person and just kept spreading throughout history until now? Multiplying through the years? 

Sorry for the post in advance, just random pre-sleeping thoughts.

But then why isn't this the case with humans and UV or Infrared light? As far as I can tell, based on that logic, we should be able to see solely UV light right? In a UV-lit room, we should still be able to see, albeit dimmer and without color. But as far as I can find, this isn't the case.

Why does skin burn in the sun (red or deeper brown), but dead bodies such as those on Everest bleach to a bright white? 

Would it not be the same biological process or is it just because there’s no red/white cells to react to the damage?

Text: [According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_water#/media/File:Water_salinity_diagram.png) sea water is 34.7 parts per thousand salt.

Between evaporation and precipitation it seems like this amount is kept largely in equilibrium but, during the last glacial maximum, a lot of this precipitation would have frozen to form glaciers. 

Since that precipitation didn't make it into the ocean it stands to reason that this would have increased the salinity of the oceans. And sure, if the amount of water held in the glaciers was a drop in the bucket compared to the water in the oceans then I guess it wouldn't have made much of a difference.

But, [according to USGS][3]: &quot;global sea level was about 125 meters below today’s sea level at the last glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago&quot;. 

This kinda makes me wonder: how saline were the oceans during the last glacial maximum?

Text: I recently got &quot;diagnosed&quot; with &quot;some sort of arthritis&quot; (they are still figuring things out) and in general have been dealing with random symptoms throughout my life, which has led me to read up on several autoimmune diseases throughout the years.

And they all seem to have one thing in common:  
We have either no idea why they happen (and in some cases not even the mechanism behind the symptoms). Or at most, a host of theories and maybe some knowledge about (potentially) involved genes (but even then, only theories, if at all, as to what actually triggers the onset).

Why is it such a struggle to figure out how autoimmune diseases work?

For comparison, the brain is still considered pretty much a black box and yet it seems to me we have more of a clue about how mental illnesses come to be, how they work, and how to diagnose and treat them, than we have about autoimmune diseases.

1. Their orbital periods are much longer and therefore passing through areas of dust happens on a lower frequency than earth 
2. The density of comets off gassing and emitting dust is lower at distance given the weakened sun power. 

Therefore, I wonder if it is much lower in likelihood. However, do planets such as Uranus and Neptune experience meteors and other ‘shooting stars’ like we do at all?

Text: Like, what does it accomplish other than arbitrarily separating enantiomers?  What significance does the lowest OH group have other than the fact that its the lowest OH group?  Is it basically just another thing we can use instead of R and S?  Why dont any of these sytems have anything to do wtih optical activity, it just seems so arbitrary and pointless.  Im sure theres something about it Im not getting.  I guess its just a way for people to be able to communicate what exactly theyre talking about to other people which is important obviously but the rules just feel so random sometimes.

Text: Sorry this question is a bit weird. We have a border collie who has so far chewed:

1. A wire on an automatic gate
2. A wire on a pump/water feature
3. The brakes wire on our caravan

But here’s the odd thing. She isn’t much of a chewer, and she stops chewing the wire after it’s disconnected. The pump wire has been severed months ago. The wires are still hanging, if they were fun to play with before, they’re still fun to play with now. Only difference is now there’s no current flowing, so no magnetic field. And she stopped chewing it.

Idk if this helps but I think all of the wires she bit were DC (connected to battery for the van and solar for the gate and pump). So a static magnetic field, same as Earth’s field, although sharks, for example, can still use it to navigate.

All of the sources online are a bit sus, but there’s a lot that claim that dogs can detect magnetic fields, so I was wondering if anyone here had thoughts on whether my dog can detect magnetic fields or if it was just a coincidence.

Is it a coinflip or is there a reason why antimatter is seemingly attracted to blackholes?

Text: Question is in the subject line above. For a more extended backstory behind this question:

This question arises from some research I've been doing on pet food safety. There is a prominent theory that legumes/pulses (like peas, lentils, chickpeas) impact food absorption or body mechanisms in a way that causes diet-associated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) aka enlargening of the heart chamber in dogs and maybe cats (this started from widespread reports to the FDA about grain-free diets and non-genetic DCM cases which led to the FDA issuing an alert and investigation into this issue).

Apparently in the pet food industry, only less than a handful of brands are ever vet-recommended mainly because their ingredients and the interactions of those ingredients in those forms have been researched front and back on safety. Namely corn. 

So apparently, when mixed with meat products, corn is harmless, but legumes might be causing severe heart problems. Why is that? I know there isn't enough research on this specifically, but in a broader sense and theoretical aspect, how can food combinations do this?

Text: Hello, folks!

I have two quick questions about gravitational waves. Let me say up top, I realize that there's not much we know about them, so I'm perfectly satisfied with 'best guess' answers here. Obviously if there *is* a known correct answer, that's best, but if not, an answer that seems to logically make sense given what we *do* know will work fine!

Now, for the questions!

1. Do gravitational waves diminish over time? Or, rather, do the distortions they cause diminish over time (and space)? Do they start to fade like a ripple in a pond, or do they maintain their level of distorting spacetime as they expand?
2. What is your best guess for how a strong gravitational wave might affect a human body? Would it just kinda pass through a person without being noticed, since it's distorting spacetime and the person is inside spacetime? Or would you feel it, kinda like a pressure wave? Would its effects likely be more macro or micro in scope? What would be your best guess as to how this would affect a human body - or, what might you compare it to? Any medical conditions you might compare it to?

Again, I realize that there's probably very little information to go on, so if we have to resort to conjecture, I'm comfortable with that, but I'd like to base our conjecture on as reasonable information and/or assumptions as possible. So! What do you all think?

Text: Before COVID I didn't really have any concept of &quot;viral load&quot;, I thought that getting infected with a virus was a very binary thing - you get exposed to the virus and you're sick, or you don't get exposed and you aren't.

Now I understand that *how much* of the virus you get exposed to can determine how sick you get. If I got drenched in the face by a sneeze from someone with a high COVID load (funny story: my first COVID infection, I believe, began with a sneeze in the face from my infected 2yo son), I would get a lot sicker than if I my exposure had been much lighter.

Is it this way for all viruses?

Like, with HIV, would I get sicker much faster and progress to AIDS much sooner, if my initial exposure was to a much larger amount of virus?

tldr; question is, do all viral infections vary in intensity according to the magnitude of the exposure? Or are some more &quot;binary&quot;? 

Bonus question:
Is there some concept of &quot;critical viral load&quot;, like, if I get a single HIV viron in my bloodstream, there's a chance it will never find a host and the infection will never happen (right?). But if there are 1000, infection is a certainty (right?). So there's a 'critical value' somewhere in-between (right?). How does this vary for different viruses - are some more *virulent* than others? Someone educate me!

Text: Most birds have a very unusual and particular way of moving--you know, lots of swift, jerky movements, particularly the head when they're looking around. Mammals, even small ones that might occupy the same sorts of niches as some small birds, move much more smoothly. Why is that? Is it something to do with their musculature, or differences in the nervous system, or evolutionary pressures (probably), or what? 

A bonus question: do scientists think that dinosaurs moved similarly? So would a t-rex jerk its head around like a chicken or an ostrich?

Text: I’m sure it depends on their location/climate. Maybe it’s best to focus on comfortable climates. 

I was watching someone on TikTok make the point that Ted Kazinski said in his manifesto that he wanted humans to return to the time before technology started booming because early humans were focused solely on survival and he liked that for some reason.

It all got me thinking, how hard was it out there for early man?

I’m talking pre agriculture Homo sapiens. Part of me agrees and thinks it was hard for my ancient brothers and sisters and that existence would be a constant toggle between fight and flight. But another part of me thinks, wait a minute. Those dudes pretty much had all of my cognitive ability. They just lacked my technology and cultural knowledge. Maybe these guys are smart enough to get food fast and then chill for the rest of the day.

Isn’t that what our technology comes from - leisure time? Maybe these mother fuckers had it in droves. 

To be clear, I’m not saying Ted Kazinsky was on to something. The process of getting back to those days is a non-starter. 

I’m just wondering if there was a golden age of kicking it for thousands of years rolling out of bed and spending 2 hours per day hunting and gathering and then doing an hour or so of chores and shit and then the rest of the day is yours. 

was inventing agriculture a mistake?

I’m seriously amazed we as a species managed to survive in the wilderness with our caloric requirements, assuming there wasn’t a massive shift in those between early humans and now.

Text: Hello,
  

  
I recently had a flu vaccine and was wondering about the effect on older ones.
  

  
From the very limited amount that I understand, the body creates antibodies and memory cells in response to a vaccine, which helps your body fight the disease in future.
  

  
However there is presumably a finite number of possible antibodies and memory cells in a body. As such, does having a new vaccine dilute the effect of previous ones to any significant degree?

As an example, if someone takes a flu vaccine every year for forty years, would this be expected to have an effect on reducing defenses against illnesses they were vaccinated against when a child? 

Many thanks in advance! (I searched to see if this was covered but all responses that come up are questions about COVID vaccines from 2021-23)

Text: Hello folks,

I've got a question about iron in human biology. I know that it's used for lots of things, but I don't really know what it actually does: I know it's present in blood, and I read something about a protein called ferritin that's present in most cells, but I have no idea *how* it assists with blood or what ferritin *does*. And I'm sure iron does other things in the body that I don't know about!

So, I've got three questions:

1. What things does iron do in the body, and how does it do them?
2. What is it about iron that makes it able to do these things? Could another kind of metal do the same thing, or does it *have* to be iron? Maybe another kind of ferromagnetic metal?
3. Does iron interact, or is it involved, with DNA at all? Or no?

I'd appreciate it, too, if you could explain this in as simple terms as possible, because I am not at all a biologist or physician. Thank you!

I've heard of certain kinds of bacteria that can only thrive on the bones of whales at the bottom of the ocean (Whale fall) and that led me to thinking that obviously humans in all of their ignorance have haphazardly created locations on Earth unlike anything nature could possibly form before leaving them to fall apart.

  
I know that there's been talk of creating a designed bacteria to breakdown and digest plastic for use in environmental contexts, but is there any scientific backing to the notion that mankind has already accidentally created bacteria that flourishes breaking down metal alloys or potentially biohazardous waste that's not naturally occurring? Are there any actual recorded examples of this happening? If there ARE examples of this happening, what brakes are there in place to prevent larger and more complicated life from changing and adapting around manmade structures? Is it out of the question that there may be complicated species that dwell entirely in manmade environments?

Looking forward to answering any questions you might have for a longtime practitioner. I love my work and have learned pretty much everything I know from my patients. What really matters is what works for someone in all their individuality.

I started in this field in the 1990s knowing nothing about sleep other than how good it felt and how many psychotherapy patients struggled with it. My boss at the time generously offered me the life-changing job-which I didn't know existed--while we were kibbitzing in the hallway. He might as well have casually suggested that I teach a course on comparative vertebrate morphology. But I learned on the job, and learned through parenting both the toll sleep loss takes and its survivability.  I have increasingly come to appreciate how the disciplines of sleep therapy and psychotherapy inform each other. My practice and the field have evolved a lot since the days of same-old, same-old behavioral advice.

This is of course not a healthcare forum, so any information provided here is for educational purposes only and is not a substitute for personalized, professional care from a qualified healthcare provider.

Sleep physicians are usually someone's first stop because they can evaluate for a range of conditions that go beyond the behavioral and psychological.

Medical school coursework in psychiatry and neuroscience convinced him that the greatest need, and greatest promise, for biomedical science was in these areas. Dr. Gordon's research focuses on the analysis of neural activity in mice carrying mutations of relevance to psychiatric disease. His lab studied genetic models of these diseases from an integrative neuroscience perspective, focused on understanding how a given disease mutation leads to a behavioral phenotype across multiple levels of analysis. To this end, he employs a range of systems neuroscience techniques, including in vivo imaging, anesthetized and awake behavioral recordings, and optogenetics, which is the use of light to control neural activity. His research has direct relevance to schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, and depression. [Follow Dr. Gordon on Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/NIMHDirector).



[Shelli Avenevoli, Ph.D.](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/organization/od/about-nimh-deputy-director-shelli-avenevoli-phd), is the Deputy Director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). In 2001, Dr. Avenevoli joined the NIMH intramural research program as a staff scientist in the Section of Developmental Genetic Epidemiology of the Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program. In 2005, she moved to the NIMH division of extramural research as Chief of the Emotion, Mood, and Depressive Disorders Program. In 2008, Dr. Avenevoli became Chief of the Developmental Trajectories of Mental Disorders Branch. She has been heavily involved in a number of key NIMH efforts, including revising NIMH's Strategic Plan, re-defining the Institute's approach to supporting research in neurodevelopment and bipolar disorder, and serving as a liaison to other agencies for special initiatives. Prior to joining NIMH, Dr. Avenevoli received her Ph.D. in Developmental Psychology from Temple University, and completed an NIMH-funded postdoctoral fellowship in psychiatric epidemiology at Yale University School of Medicine.

Text: I feel like this question gets asked quite often, but I haven't seen any responses that would satisfy my.

Can we be cartain that everyone sees colors the same way? I'm not talking about colorblindness.

People usually reply with ,,we can't know&quot;, or ,,there are slight diffrences&quot;, but I want to know if we can reasonably assume that someone's blue might be another person's red.

I know it's technically possible, because we can't really check color interpretation differences between people, but this doesn't seem right to me. 

Could our brains really perceive colors so differently? I mean if you look at the color spectrum, blue and red are far apart. How would our brains come to such different results? Wouldn't everything have to be swapped around? 

The wavelength of red is around 700nm and the wavelength of blue is around 500nm. If some people saw red as blue, why would their brain jump from orange to blue without any colors in between?

Another thing is, wouldn't that result in a lot of people having color blindness? Chances of having colorblindness are quite low, especially if you have XX chromosomes. Wouldn't a lot of people perceiving colors very differently lead to genes often mixing in a way that would leave some blind spots on the spectrum?

Text: Consider a person without any clothes.

By without any harm I mean, no frost bite or hypothermia even after living in that temperature for hours. Shivering is fine. (Assume the person has access to infinite food, but the human is normal, so can eat only the amount his body allows him to eat and can digest.)

\___

This question is not about internal/core body temperature.


This question came to my mind while I was reading about how some researches found that living in cold temperatures lead to more number of brown fat cells.
And people with higher number of brown fat cells start to shiver at lower temperatures, because brown cells can use energy quicker to heat up the body.

\___

I am trying find the lowest, the temperature which no one can withstand without body getting harmed.

I see articles saying that all or most crab species have hemocyanin, but find no videos of the blue blood from crabs other than horseshoe crabs, who arent even crabs technically.

Text: Hello everyone,

I'm curious about how to handle number sequences that don't follow traditional linear patterns. For example, we all know a sequence like 2, 4, 6 can be easily described with a function like f(x) = 2*x. But what if we encounter a sequence that doesn't follow such a straightforward pattern? For instance, consider a sequence like 8, 3, 7, 1, -5, or any other seemingly random set of numbers.

My questions are:

1. How can we accurately describe these unconventional sequences using a mathematical formula?
2. Is there a method to predict future values in such sequences, assuming they follow some underlying but non-obvious pattern?

I'm interested in any mathematical or statistical models that could be applied to this problem. Any insights or references to relevant theories and techniques would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you in advance!

Text: **Please read this entire post carefully and format your application appropriately.**

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/15186wx/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxiv/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).
* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)
* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)
* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?
* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

\-------------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

`Username: /u/foretopsail`

`General field: Anthropology`

`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`

`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`

`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`

`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

Text: In high school, I used to assume that the bone marrow was connected to the bloodstream in a simple way, and that all blood cells moved into the rest of the body by means of diffusion. But that is not the case. 

Apparently, finished blood cells have to &quot;squeeze&quot; through semi-permeable tissue before they're allowed to enter the veins. I doubt this is accomplished through simple stochastic processes alone. Unfortunately, it's been difficult trying to figure out how this looks at a granular level, and I don't know where to begin. 

I wanted to know more about how this is accomplished, if there are any key gateway proteins or other molecules responsible for the process, if this process looks substantially different for each kind of blood cell (e.g. RBCs, WBCs, platelets, etc.), etc. A brief rundown or series of pointers that can get me going on my own research would help enormously.

It is my understanding that most roads (in the US at least) are salted with sodium chloride, which only has a van't hoff factor of 2 (dissociates into 2 particles, 1 Na+ ion and 1 Cl- ion).  


 Why don't they use a more effective salt that has a higher van't Hoff factor, like Magnesium Chloride (dissociates into 3 particles, 1 Mg+2 ion and 2 Cl- ions)? Wouldn't those salts do a better job at keeping the roads clear?

Text: If you play a note of a certain frequency on a flute and simultaneously sing a note at a different frequency, then you create a third frequency that wouldn't be there if you play or sing in isolation - and the frequency of this subharmonic is the difference of the flute frequency and the voice frequency (I'm talking about the fundamental frequencies for simplicity). This is caused by modulation (product rule: cos(f1*x)cos(f2x) = 0.5*(cos(f1-f2)+cos(f1+f2)), which in turn suggests some nonlinearity in the system.

I made some observations about this effect:

1. It is not unique to flutes- works on any wind instrument (commonly known as Growling on saxophones)
2. It is NOT the Tartini tone / missing fundamental / difference tone. I know it might be tempting to classify it as such, but keep in mind that the Tartini tone is just in your head (caused by some nonlinearity in the hearing apparatus). The subharmonic mentioned here is clearly measurable on a spectrogram.
3. Whistling into the flute does not work. Sure, it produces a beat frequency (linear superposition) and a Tartini tone (illusion in your head), but the subharmonic is not visible on the spectrogram. This suggests to me that the nonlinearity that causes the modulation is somehow in the vocal chords. The problem might be somehow linked to coupled oscillators, but beyond me right now.

Do you have an intuitive explanation for this? Thanks!

Text: Hi everyone.   


As the title says, and this might be a very stupid question: how do we process numbers in the context of longer texts or conversations? 

AFAIK, there's quite a lot written on shorter/longer/bigger/smaller multi-digit numbers from the perspective of mathematical cognition. However, they're studied in isolation from the usual contextual information you'd have if you'd encountered such a number in a 'normal' context, e.g. in conversation. 

Are numbers just processed holistically, somewhat like semantically-meaningful words? Digit-by-digit? How does it work? How are they linked to measurements expressed verbally, e.g. *5 pounds of...*? In short, how do we get from digits to meaningful phrases?

I’ve searched far and wide and cannot seem to find any answers. They don’t appear to be the sand ridges of the Simpson desert, they look drastically different, some look like the first picture looks (I see many of these when flying overhead) like off-road tracks/manmade clearing - however they certainly are not as they almost never link to a road, yet are clearly gaps in foliage
Are these survey lines? Mine suitability testing? Maybe even the remains of roads of a ghost town/telegraph line towns?

[These](https://www.google.com/maps/place/23%C2%B010'37.4%22S+122%C2%B033'54.8%22E/@-23.1736845,122.5835532,12z/data=!3m1!1e3!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d-23.1770556!4d122.5652222)

These look like wind erosion to me, however it seems strange to me as looking at wind maps it seems to be heading in the wrong direction/doesn’t correlate with wind patterns (I could be wrong, I’m not meteorologists)

Text: Earlier today, I was looking up what caused the glaciation of Antarctica, and also when it took place. As I understand it, the main causes were the appearance of the Circumpolar Current and a drop in global temperatures caused by falling CO₂ levels.

What I couldn't seem to find was an explanation as to ***why*** there was a global drop in CO₂ during the Late Eocene. The Azolla event is theorised to have been responsible for a similar drawdown during the Middle Eocene, but is separated from the Late Eocene by the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum, a period when CO₂ levels were among their highest.

To go from the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum to global temperatures being cool enough to allow permanent ice sheets to form over Antarctica, the drop in CO₂ levels in the Late Eocene must surely have been dramatic, but I couldn't seem to find an explanation as to what had caused/contributed to it.

Text: How is it determined when a species died out? Are fossils normally so abundant that a lack of them clearly shows a species was no longer present?

As a specific example, I'm interested in horses in America. Are those abundant in fossil record before they are thought to have died out??

In general, I am under the impression that for some species at least, fossils aren't very abundant at all, so I wonder how one could conclude that a species died out X thousand years ago if fossils were rare to begin with. Maybe because the preconditions for fossilization weren't there, or the population was small, or other reasons.

Text: Isn't part of knowing something is invasive is because we have a somewhat current record of what species belong where? Thus, any deviation from the present status and an introduction of a new plant or animal into an existing system we can identify as invasive?   


Example: If we stumbled on island A and we identified a certain new creature, we wouldn't know if it arrived there last month, last year, last decade, or it's native to that island since forever. Further, what if we stumbled on another island, not necessarily close by the first island, and there we also found the same creature. How would we know that this creature was a native of island B versus an invader from island A, or vice versa (a native of Island A, and an invader on Island B)?   


If the creature on one island was fluorishing, does that make them invasive? What if the creature did end up on Island B from Island A somehow, but on Island B, they were languishing, not fluorishing? Would they still be invasive, even if they weren't thriving, and would likely die out?

Are the outer layers of the star dense enough to decay the orbit of the planet, sending it spiraling toward the core of the star? Does the gravity of the planet carve out a bizarre hill sphere of dense stellar atmosphere around the planet? What might be the difference between the orbital velocity of the planet and the rotational speed of the stellar atmosphere at that distance? When the star collapses to a white dwarf, is it possible the planet has survived somewhat intact?

Text: I've been seeing antiviral nasal sprays mentioned more often recently, especially in &quot;covid conscious&quot; communities. The products claim to both block viruses from being absorbed in the nasal cavity and to &quot;inactivate&quot; viruses.

1. Is there any credible evidence that these products do anything to prevent viral infections?
2. Even if these products *did* completely prevent viruses from being absorbed through membranes in the nose, would it matter?

Examples of some products that are being marketed under this umbrella:

- [BioSURE \(Ethyl Lauroyl Arginate Hydrochloride\)](https://bebiosure.com/blogs/blogs/the-science-behind-biosure-pro-protective-nasal-spray-and-why-it-really-does-work)
    - &quot;the BioSURE PRO formulation is able to block and even inactivate the virus to help naturally reduce the risk of infection&quot;
- [Covixyl (also ELAH](https://covixyl.com/pages/about)
    - &quot;The molecule binds to cells in the nose where it blocks the virus from attaching to nasal tissue and inactivates virus particles&quot;
    - &quot;Initial testing against SARS-CoV-2, Rotavirus, H1N1 (Influenza A), and Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) proved the efficacy of ELAH against infection in vitro, showing 99+% reduction across all 4 viruses.  &quot;
- [Enovid \(Nitric Oxide Nasal Spray\)](https://buyenov.com/pages/clinical-data)
    - &quot;...participants who took NONS after COVID-19 exposure were 75% less likely to become infected when compared to the control group...&quot;
    - &quot;After confirmed exposure to COVID-19, infection rate in participants (n=625) who took NONS™ was 6.4% versus 25.6% in the control group (P&lt;0.0001).&quot;
- Bonus: [Xlear \(Xylitol\)](https://xlear.com/xlear-sinus-care/). Not *currently* claiming anything about COVID, I assume because they are being [sued by the FDA](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/10/ftc-sues-utah-based-company-falsely-claiming-its-nasal-sprays-can-prevent-treat-covid-19)

With the fact that young kids probably don't realise the nature of their cold sores, and may suck their thumbs or touch their eyes (and maybe their genitals), why aren't there more cases of ocular herpes and herpetic whitlow (which has a diagnosis of around 2.4 per 100,000, or a rate of 0.0024%). On top of this, HSV-1 can shed without symptoms, further increasing the risk that children and even adults unknowingly spread it across themselves. Why aren't these conditions more common (emphasis on the ocular and finger ones, as I can understand why genital HSV-1 is common due to oral sex in teens, though info on that would be cool too)?

Text: I’ve recently gotten into charcuterie, and in the textbook I use as my main resource, there is a chapter on whether or not we made better sausages in the past, citing things like: lack of excess preservatives beyond just curing salt or regular salt, hand making the sausages, and having to rely on nature as opposed to manufactured environments to cure and dry sausages. This also made me curious on a wider scale though: did we actually make better food (in regard to animal products like meat and dairy) in the past? When looking it up I came across an answer to a similar question someone asked on Quora (which I’m taking with a grain of salt) that said that due to things like feedlot farming and things like feeding cows corn due to the low cost and efficiency, even though it’s not their regular diet, can cause an animal to be stressed. In turn, apparently the adrenaline and cortisol can affect the taste of the meat. I know that things like diet and exercise for an animal can affect the taste of its meat, but can stress-related chemicals really do the same? And how does this hold true for something like foie gras, where birds certainly must be under stress as they are force fed in order to engorge the liver, yet most people enjoy foie gras for its taste, as well as its texture?

Text: So I am rereading Project Hail Mary at the moment. 

In the book, the main character meets an alien, named Rocky, who lives on a planet with such a thick atmosphere that light can't reach the ground. The characters talk with each other about their biology at length in order to learn about one another, and they talk a lot about sleep, too. Rocky has a weird sleep cycle and lives on a planet that also spins very fast. His sleep cycle does not seem to match his planet's day-night cycle. 

This got me wondering about Earth life. From what I understand, all animals sleep, it's almost a biological mandate. Even though some are nocturnal, it seems that sleep cycles are still, somewhat, in tune with the rotation of the Earth. Sunlight would be the main indicator for the body for any creature that can see daylight. 

But what about animals that live in total darkness, like in caves or deep in the ocean? Do we know anything about their sleep patterns? If we do, do they somehow follow a day/night cycle?

I suspect we probably know very little about these animals, but I'm really curious about this.

Furthermore, it is known that lots of people with herpes tend to never show any symptoms, while others may experience them highly frequently. Is there a definite correlation between these triggers and outbreaks, and can a person’s immune system or genetics play a role in their occurrences?

Text: Maybe I'm just racist but all those animals look the same to me. And incest causes some pretty bad effects, so I'd imagine they'd want to avoid it. Dogs don't even check to see if they are humping a dog and not a couch, doubt they'd check if they're related in the wild.

I’m aware they’re kept warm but that just means they dont have to heat themselves. that energy can’t be used for division which is the main thing I’m curious about.

Text: The paradox of hair loss is that while we seem to lose the hair on our heads, it tends to increase everywhere else on our bodies.

Many men entering their 40s and 50s will develop baldness. That said, they paradoxically seem to gain body hair in other place. Some examples of this may be thicker beards or ear hair or thicker chest and back hair.

My question is why does the process which causes hair loss on the tops of our heads not impact hair on the rest of our bodies? It seems like we start off young with a full head of hair and lack of body hair. Then we lose our hair and our bodies go into hair growth overdrive.

Is there an answer as to why?

Text: Its my understanding (please correct me if Im wrong) that the difference between diluted ethanol and an alcoholic drink (say whisky) is the presence of congeners - a complex mix of dissolved compounds that develop during production and maturation. Break-down of fermentation/distillation products and the acquisition of solutes present in the oak casks, result in a highly complex mixture of compounds. These compounds, collectively referred to as congeners are what determine the taste/smell of the whisky. The abundance/concentration of various individual congeners is what separates Lagavulin from Laphroaig and more broadly, what separates different kinds of whisk(e)ys.

Lets say you have a well equipped anal chem lab and unlimited time/money. You acquire a bottle of Lagavulin just before its casked, analyze it and then 16y later obtain a bottle from the same cask for comparison. Are modern spectrometry and other analytical techniques advanced enough to confidently identify the precise composition/identity of congeners present in each bottle?

If so, is it possible to isolate (or alternatively, synthesize) the individual congeners in the mature bottle and then add them to the pre-cask whisky (at the measured concentrations) to &quot;instantly&quot; mature it? Or is the chemistry during maturation too complex to define and/or reproduce accurately?

Or better yet, as a pipe dream develop a lyophilized &quot;congener concentrate&quot;  (ideally one free of histamine and other biogenic amines) that one could reconstitute with ethanol+water.

Obviously the cost effectiveness in either case would be questionable. But if you had best proc dev team on earth and could consistently isolate/reconstitute the congeners at large scales, I'd wager it could reap huge profits over the long term.

Text: So, if we pretend there is no air/atmosphere, it seems like a projectile launched exactly vertically will always land in the same spot. This makes sense for things like a baseball, an arrow, or even a bullet shot out of a gun. But what happens when we really push the envelope and say hypothetically we shoot something straight up at a wicked initial velocity of, lets say, 15,000 m/s. The projectile will travel several thousand miles above the surface of the earth, until gravitational acceleration eventually overcomes the initial velocity and it falls back to the earth. Will it land in the exact same spot?? Or because the earth is rotating, will it land in a different spot? Would it make a difference if you launch it from the north pole or from the equator? According to newton's equations, our projectile would land almost an hour after it was launched.

While it is a fantasy novel I do prefer to keep stuff like this accurate so was wondering what would actually occur as the mountain heats up in as much detail as possible.

I can clarify if needed but these are the factors I know will be relevant:

1. Heavy snowfall (let's say 4.5 feet)

2. Mountain heating up from near the base

3. Relatively conical mountain

Thanks for all the help everyone! I think I got a good basis to make everything work and be at the very least not so far off it doesn't make sense.

Text: I understand the risk of pregnancy is a huge, if not the main factor in this - 

But I saw this article yesterday:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2024/02/01/why-women-have-more-autoimmune-diseases/

It mentions that overwhelmingly, research is done on men, which I’ve heard. So they only just now are discovering a potential cause of a huge health issue that predominantly affects women.

And it got me thinking - surely we could involve more of us gals in research by selecting menopausal women, prepubescent girls, maybe even avowed celibate women.

I’m sure it would be limited to an extent because of that sample size, but surely it would make a significant difference in understanding our unique health challenges, right? I mean, I was a girl, then an adult woman who never got pregnant, then a post-menopausal woman… any research that could have helped me could have been invaluable.

Are there other barriers preventing studying women’s health that I’m not aware of? Particularly ones that don’t involve testing medication. Is it purely that we might get a bun in the oven? 

Edit: thanks so much for the very detailed and thought provoking responses. I look forward to reading all of your links and diving in further. Much appreciate everyone who took time to respond! And please, keep them coming!

Text: When we breathe, we use the oxygen of the air to oxydize our body sugar or fat to produce energy (via ATP molecules). Water and carbon dioxyde (CO2) are by-products of these reactions. ATP is used by our muscles to move. Water is easily recycled within our body and we finally exhale the CO2. So O2 in, energy and water in the middle and CO2 out.

Now, we don't inhale oxygen, we inhale air which is roughly made of 80% nitrogen, 20% oxygen and a few other molecules in very little quantities. So does our body handle or process the nitrogen in the air, and if so, how ?

so I've read that you cannot carbon date rocks. However, these &quot;stone tools&quot; were dated to 3.7 million years old.

Ok, so 2 questions:  
1) Frankly, they look like random pieces of rock. I'm willing to bet that if I walked to a hill, I can pick up 3/4 of those rocks. How would these scientists know that they are tools indeed?  


2) I've read that radiocarbon dating cannot work on rocks, and it definitely cannot be used to date items past the 60 000 years mark. How would anyone be able to even accurately date it?

Text: Sea water contains [roughly 35,000mg of salt per liter (1000ml).](https://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/ocean/sea-water) At 20 °C (68 °F), [one liter of water can dissolve about 350,000mg of salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_water) (10x the amount in sea water). Adult humans should have no more than [2,300mg salt per day](https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-education-resources-materials/sodium-your-diet), which I assume is related to how much salt the kidney can (safely) filter. (I couldn't find anything related to the kidney's salt-filtration power after several minutes of googling.)

By my flawed logic, humans should be able to drink some small amount of sea water, excrete the excess salt using a fraction of the sea water consumed, and then keep the remaining desalinated sea water for hydration.

Using hard numbers: Consume 25ml of sea water containing \~875mg salt, urinate \~3ml of water containing all \~875mg of salt, keep \~22ml water for hydration.

Even if salt can't be excreted at the density at which it can be dissolved, there's still room for more water to be used for urination that's also less than the amount consumed.

I know I've taken several logical leaps here, but without additional information I have no choice but to wonder. What am I missing? Thank you.

Can water from food combined with the drink meet that level if not just the drink? 

Curious in this day in age and all the sugary drinks and such how it could replace, not that it should, some of the ways we are used to getting our daily supplements. Perhaps even does and we don't realize it commonly but interesting to know if it can entirely. I feel some issues would pop up at some point.

I've heard the reason we don't have much fossil evidence or complete fossil evidence from stages before the K-P extinction event is because many animals were scavenged upon dispersing the bodies. So, with the rapid change in climate, mass die-off after the asteroid collision, and destruction of so many millions, if not billions of animals with very few larger non-avian dinosaurs to destroy the evidence then where are the fossils? Several billion organisms dying off in about a million years or less would certainly have a large footprint, wouldn't it?

Text: I know in general that when things go wrong that the body can and that is basically how we can get cancers or invasive scaring, but in general, how does the body know not to go haywire? For instance, when a tooth breaks, the gum tries to heal and seal over the broken bits if left untreated in the gum. Why doesn't this happen to our teeth in general, then? When we get a cut or burn, the wound seals, but even if it is bad, such as a whole hand injury, you generally don't get fingers fusing together. I would attribute some to movement, but this doesn't solve every case. There are people that can't eat or talk and their teeth are normal. There are people that are immobilize after serious injury and they heal normally. Is dna really that complex that it knows how to heal a finger, an arm, that it knows when to stop the healing process and when to reactivate it? Is there not an answer yet and that is why we can't trigger these mechanisms ourselves to grow new limbs for instance?

Text: In light of the seeming extinction of the Influenza B/Yamagata lineage, the WHO recommended in September that “the inclusion of a B/Yamagata antigen as a component of influenza vaccines is no longer warranted, and every effort should be made to exclude it as soon as possible.&quot;

The response to this has been that the flu vaccine market is shifting back to the trivalent vaccine used up until QIVs were introduced. The WHO has also acknowledged that additional support will be needed for manufacturers who currently only make quadrivalent vaccines to pivot to making trivalent vaccines.

However, my question is -- if we're already prepared to produce quadrivalent vaccines, why don't we take the &quot;slot&quot; opened by B/Yamagata to immunize for a third variety of Influenza A? For example, the Northern &amp; Southern hemisphere currently have different recommendations for the H3N2 vaccine component. Wouldn't it make more sense to have both H3N2 varieties packaged together and utilize the existing technology for a quadrivalent vaccine?

Text: I am trying to learn about the near-field and far-field effects of antennas, but do not have the necessary background to understand. My knowledge of electromagnetic physics begins and ends by approximating what comes out of an antenna as a plane-wave over a sufficient distance.

However, when reading about the near-field, many descriptions of it refer to the em waves *reacting* with the antenna. This makes me wonder: hypothetically, if a massless, chargeless point in space began emitting electromagnetic waves, would there exist a near-field about this point in space, or would there be no near-field due to there being nothing for the waves to interact with?

Text: I was thinking about concussions and how devastating they can be to the brain and I wondered if there were ways to mitigate the damage sustained from your brain smacking across solid bone. Then I thought about how woodpeckers protect themselves with their tongue as padding. I wondered why humans hadn’t evolved a similar soft tissue padding inside their skulls before realizing we didn’t have much need for it as head injuries probably weren’t a common cause of death in our history. Then I thought about how Neanderthals are said to have bigger brains and I’m assuming we think that because they had larger skulls and assumed it must’ve been filled with more Brian’s. But I’ve heard they were able to take much larger blows, say from a big animal, and survive. Being knocked around because of an insistence to use melee combat when hunting as opposed to spear probably would result in alot of deaths due to head injuries. So my question is, is there a possibility that they had larger skulls to make room for a kind of soft tissue padding for their brains? I mean if they had larger brains wouldn’t they have figured out that if they were dying to Homo sapiens because they’re throwing spears then maybe they should’ve done the same?

I'm curious now how common this is, and what the impacts of these kinds of situations are on conservation projects; I'm also wondering if this may become more common as climate changes and the habitable ranges of plants and animals move outside of their historical ranges.

What kinds of plants and animals are simultaneously endangered in their natural range, and detrimentally invasive in other areas?

Are there any notable examples of species that are fully extirpated from their native range, but where introduced wild populations continue to thrive elsewhere? If so, how do conservationists approach these situations?

Text: ASTM E595 outlines the process to test and requirements required to pass outgassing for space and other critical systems. It is generally considered the “standard” for all outgassing testing criteria, at least in my field. 

What I am struggling to understand is why the TML (total mass loss) is adjusted down based on the WVR (water vapor recovered)? 

The process states that the test sample will be exposed to a 50% RH environment for 24 hours then put into the test environment, which is some X hours at some T temperature (can’t remember exactly what these values are). 

The mass lost in the test environment relative to the mass after the 24hr exposure to 50% RH is the TML. 

Afterwards, there is an “optional” step where the sample is re-exposed to the same 50% RH environment for 24hrs and its mass is measured again. The mass regained can then be deducted from the previously calculated TML to get the adjusted value. 

Why is this allowed? Does outgassing in space not care about water vapor? If so, why not? 

Edit: to any one who is curious: I reached out to the ASTM standards people and got a response from the engineers responsible for outgassing standards and she said that they allow for the exclusion of WVR for the same reasons that SAE standard allows for the reduction of TMR (I may have gotten the acronyms wrong, sorry I’m drinking lol). 

That is, water vapor is reduced in *some* but not all cases because generally speaking water vapor is not considered to be a major contaminant in space applications. I believe this is due to the fact that small amounts of water will sublimate in space and so it will not cause condensation issues and will simply dissipate into space. 

However, it is ultimately up to the client/customer to determine whether or not they approve of the use of WVR to meet the 1% TML standard.

Text: Electrical ground seemed simple at first, but the more I've studied electronics the less I've understood it.   
Examples of confusion are:  


The earth, dirt, seems pretty insulating. If I touch an electric fence wearing rubber boots, I wont be shocked, but without those boots I should be. What makes rubber such a better insulator than dirt to prevent me from being shocked? How can electricity travel to the &quot;ground&quot; when the ground (earth) is non metallic?

A 3 phase delta generator, going through a rectifier, to a load, to ground, according to my teacher will have no current going through it since the ground doesn't connect back to the delta generator. Why must the current return to the generator, couldn't it dissipate into &quot;ground&quot;.   
A DC circuit I can understand needing to complete the loop, however with AC it seems like I should be able to generate electricity, send it out somewhere, without the need for return.   


Ground has been defined as 0 volts. A car chassis is connected to &quot;ground&quot;. If I then connect the car to the earth, does the car chassis no longer have exactly 0 volts, since the earth is *more ground?*

Text: So after the Big Bang, everything was sent shooting off at a zillion miles per hour in all different directions. Since everything was going in an outward trajectory from the point of the Big Bang (if space is even considered to have existed then), and assuming there's no/negligible drag on a galaxy zooming through space, how would the velocities of Milky Way and Andromeda change to now be directed towards the point of collision? The only thing I can think of is if they're pulling on each other via gravity, but that seems unlikely given their distance of 2.537 million lightyears.

Can a galaxy's trajectory through space curve?

Are both the Milky Way and Andromeda headed in the same direction, and one is catching up to the other? But if that's the case, why would one of them be slowing down?

Imagery downlinked from the helicopter indicated that one or more of its rotor blades [sustained damage during its Flight 72 landing on Jan. 18, 2024](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/9540/after-three-years-on-mars-nasas-ingenuity-helicopter-mission-ends/), rendering it no longer capable of flight.

Designed as a technology demonstration that was expected to fly no more than five times over 30 days, the helicopter's primary mission was to prove that powered, controlled flight on another planet was possible, which it did on April 19, 2021. But Ingenuity exceeded expectations, [transitioning into an operations demonstration](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-ingenuity-helicopter-to-begin-new-demonstration-phase) that paved the way for future aerial exploration on the Red Planet and beyond.

Or what it's like to [talk to the helicopter](https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/385/keeping-our-sense-of-direction-dealing-with-a-dead-sensor/) from here on Earth?

Text: I was wondering, what if the tilt of the Earth with respect to the Sun was fixed somehow - so, for example, we take its tilt on December 21 and so, now, Earth is tilted North-away from the Sun forever.

I was thinking about how it gets colder in winter since the winter hemisphere is tilted away from the Earth (and vice-versa for summer) - but then it starts to tilt back again after the Solstice (since the Earth's axial tilt is actually fixed with respect to, I dunno, &quot;space&quot;), and so the cooling stops and things start warming up again. If the tilt were fixed, how much colder would the winter hemisphere get? How much hotter would the summer hemisphere get? How close do we get to whatever the &quot;equilibrium winter/summer&quot; would be?

*I know this is impossible*, I know that it would require the Earth's rotation to actually constantly be changing, which couldn't happen and would cause some other maybe catastrophic things to happen if you were to somehow force it to happen. I really just want to understand about just how far the whole &quot;getting colder/warmer as we move towards the solstices&quot; thing could go, hypothetically.

Thanks!

Thinking about stuff like Mt. Saint Helens for example: There were warnings in place, and fortunately the area is thinly populated in Skamania, WA. Yet given all the protective measures we have in place today, could a pyroclastic stream like that destroy a city like that and killing all the people, or would we be able to evacuate in time?

Text: I was using a pretty realistic map generator, which at one point yielded a very interesting feature on one of the continents: a river that began in the arctic tundra of the southern hemisphere, and snaked its way through taiga and steppes and deserts and forests, well into the tropics, until it reached the sea north of the equator. Depending on the season, parts of the river, in the desert, almost dried out, while at peak, the river's discharge when it entered the sea in the tropics was about 3 million m^(3)/s. I think the river was at least 13 000 km long? Winding of course...

Does anything of this seem remotely plausible? The Nile isn't nearly that long, I mean in terms of distance from the equator. The longest river I seem to be able to find any evidence of, prehistorically I mean, seems to be closer to 10 000 km. And that discharge... isn't it more than all rivers of Earth combined? I know much higher discharge rates have occurred in geological times, like the Zanclean flood, which was much, much bigger, or the Missoula floods... but they were very temporary. Could such a high discharge as this fictional river actually work, if continents looked differently? Would so much water in a river system somehow affect the climate, or is that amount of water still far too small to be noticed in the grand scheme of things? Rather: could enough water even be deposited by rain, or from glacier melt water?

Text: I know that the differing red/black color is due to differing X chromosome inactivation, and that the white color is due to the piebald gene altering the migration of pigment producing cells across the body, but how do these interact? Why is it that in an individual cat, there’s bigger patches of color next to white spots but it’s more brindled farther away? Is the white spot stopping the spread of one color but not another? I’m guessing it isn’t actually doing anything with the X activation or gene expression and instead is about the physical movement of pigment or how the cells divide, but Im not sure exactly how it works. 

Mostly I guess I just want to know how the pigment cells spread over the body to make patterns in animals.

Text: My guess is that it would work sort of similar to a nondisjunction in the first phase of meiosis, you would end up with 2 of the chromosomes in one daughter cell, and 1 chromosome in the other daughter cell. Then if everything else goes well, then of the 4 resulting daughter cells, 2 of them would have n chromosomes, and the other 2 would have n+1 chromosomes. But I wasn't able to find anything about it online.

Text: I understand that we could (up until recently) communicate very slowly with Voyager I. I also understand that Voyager I's nuclear generator will stop working at some point (I've seen some reporting that the generator will stop working around 2025). Once Voyager is fully powered down or has broken to the point where it cannot communicate with us (which may be the case right now?), can we still track Voyager I with direct sensing? In other words, I understand that with astrophysical simulation we can estimate where Voyager is at any time in the future, but once Voyager can no longer transmit back to us, do we have any way of &quot;seeing&quot; voyager. In other words, are we able to aim a very powerful telescope at Voyager and see a reflection (or a transit of a star?). Could we aim a laser at Voyager and confirm that Voyager is where we thought it was by the reflection of the laser?  In other words, once Voyager I stops transmitting to us, would we have any way of knowing that it still exists (as opposed to, say, crashing into a rogue asteroid)?

Was that just wrong information is it actually possible to spread radioactivity into other materials?

I always assumed that if a radioactive object is air tight sealed it doesnt make the room Radioactive.... ofc while the Uranium piece is there you can measure it but as soon as you put it away the room should be completely clean and free of anything but the natural background radiation....

I think I understand how excessive proteins/carbs/fats can be stored in human body, but what's the deal with alcohol? Let's say my body needs 2000 calories and I eat exactly that PLUS I drink a shot of vodka everyday - will I get fat eventually?  If so, how this happens?

Text: I know nothing about virology or anything, but I went down a rabbit hole and I'm hoping someone can clear this up for me.  


I was reading that most covid rapid tests test for the nucleocapsid protein. But as I understand it, these proteins would be enveloped by the viral envelope. How then are antibodies to bind to, and covid tests able to detect, nucleocapsid proteins? Would it not be better to test for the spike protein or something else located on the viral envelope itself?  


Along these same lines, how does a PCR test magnify genetic material of the virus to test, if this genetic material is within the capsid?

But some of it must be turned into fat. Where does that happen? What regulates the process?

Text: We have a fact: Visible light can't resolve very small things, as an explanation its said visible light has too big of a wavelength to resolve the incredibly tiny object.  


That's fair, something about light is too big to resolve the tiny object, however I can't wrap my mind around how did we decide this property is wavelength, and why would wavelength affect light's ability to resolve? Therefore my questions are:  


1. Wavelength is essentially the distance between two waves, therefore this property doesn't exist when there's a single wave. What'd happen if we tried to resolve an object by a single light wave?
2. If it's really the wavelength that matters in resolving objects, then red light should have less resolution power than purple light. Is this the case, backed by any experiments?

Text: If you look up the definitions today, a second is defined as the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of a caesium-133 atom's… vibration (I suppose?) while the meter is defined as the distance travelled by light in 1 / 299,792,458 seconds.

These definitions were definitely never taught to me in school, growing up. I guess I never asked enough questions as a kid, and just accepted second to be 1 / 60 of a minute, which is 1 / 60 of an hour, which is 1 / 24 of a day, while meter is pretty much the length stated by every ruler I've ever owned.

What if a kid is to ask me these questions today, though? Or if my future kid asks it? How and why is a second a second, or a meter is a meter? How do I explain these things in a way a kid can relate to, without going into what's caesium, or what's caesium-133, or why caesium, or why 9,192,631,770?

The meter is definitely something I'll grapple with too. I accepted the meter for what it is in day-to-day life before I learnt the speed of light in school, so the concept of defining the meter according to the distance travelled by light feels extremely circular-logic-ish in my head.

What's the accepted layman, non-pedantic definitions for SI units (not just second and meter) commonly used in day-to-day life, in terms which is relatable in day-to-day contexts?

Our latest work, a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis featured in the American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse (AJDAA), revealed that cannabis use does not significantly change non-medical opioid use among individuals undergoing opioid use disorder treatment. This finding challenges many outdated policies in U.S. opioid treatment settings, where people who use cannabis might encounter obstacles to accessing crucial medications for opioid use disorder, such as methadone and buprenorphine. We're here and eager to engage with your queries about addiction science, approaches to treating substance use disorders, or insights on publishing within the field of addiction.

Text: Hope this makes sense; I've edited it several times hoping to make it simpler. I believe the answer is that you must minimally experience the number of light years involved, but I don't know the math of relativistic time dilation to know for sure.

If a person could experience LESS than the number of light-years traveled, it would seem that talk of 'astronaut hibernation' is unnecessary.

Many thanks for your input!

Text: Overwhelmingly, the answers I've seen to this question on Reddit and elsewhere are anecdotal, so I would love to read any answers supported by strong research. However, I recognize that designing studies to answer this question are probably challenging due to sample size concerns, confounding, selection biases, etc.
  

  
A few important qualifiers to this question:
  

  
(1) I am specifically referring to primary and secondary education, not post-secondary education.
  

  
(2) I recognize that &quot;life outcomes&quot; is vague, but my goal was to keep the scope broad. Things that come to mind when I think of &quot;life outcomes&quot; which could be impacted by school type include, but are not limited to: substance use disorders/mental illness in childhood or adulthood; non-psychiatric illness in adulthood; expected lifetime wealth; expected lifetime career satisfaction; expected marital/relationship satisfaction; etc.

(3) I'd be open to comparisons between children who attend &quot;average&quot; private schools vs. those who attend &quot;average&quot; public schools... OR other comparisons, such as children who attend &quot;average&quot; private schools vs. those who attend &quot;above-average&quot; public schools. Again, I recognize that what constitutes an &quot;average&quot; school, or an &quot;above-average&quot; school, is vague, but I'd be open to any number of different operationalizations of these constructs (e.g., student-teacher ratios, AP classes offered, number of extracurriculars offered, etc.).

What about muscular people? They also have more cells to maintain, and their body is bigger.

Building muscles is believed to have many benefits: lower diabetes risks, better musculoskeletal functions, etc.
Having said that, do those benefits cancel out with the similar low-longevity risks that tall people have?

Text: I found sources saying that the Pauli Exclusion Principle was more important than electrostatic repulsion for why you can &quot;touch&quot; objects which I don't understand. This implies that Degeneracy Pressure is a kind of &quot;force&quot;, except with no mediating particle.
  

  
This is the way I understand it, suppose you have a region of space filled with electrons. They all repel each other, but you can overcome this repulsion by exerting more and more force. The resistance you feel has absolutely nothing to do with the Pauli Exclusion Principle. However, you will eventually reach a point where you quite literally can't anymore. This is because the Pauli exclusion principle says that any further compression will result in the electrons occupying the same space, which makes no sense since their wave functions are anti-symmetric. It's not a force, but more like a rule of reality that prevents any further compression.

If this estimation is based on our current/recent frame of reference, some other being on some other planet should just as easily say age of the universe is around 100 years and we should both be correct. Which should mean trying to calculate age of the universe is not really useful or meaningful?

Adding to that, suppose someone go back 6 billion years in time and try to calculate age of the universe. Wouldn't their frame of reference be much more different than ours? So, would they come up with an age of around 8 billion years?

Is it a matter of the relative advantage of dexterous hands and the opportunity cost of developing more? Seven or nine fingers would seem to be more useful than 5 if a creature were being designed from the ground up.

For that matter, would it not be just as useful to have hands with two thumbs and a single central finger?

Text: So this applies to multiple diseases, but the one in the news the most lately is obviously covid. For that reason, I'm using covid as the example, but the question goes for any disease.

After recovering from covid, it's estimated that a person has one month of near immunity, which tapers down to a mild resistance over the following two months, and then no resistance once three months have passed. (These figures may not be precise, but it's the concept that's important here.) While there's no guarantee, even in that first month, that you won't catch it again, it is less likely. So my question is:

If you were exposed on a weekly basis to covid, starting one week after recovering from having it... would it effectively refresh your period of heavy resistance? Assuming you didn't get unlucky and actually *catch* it any of the subsequent exposures, that is.

Text: I've spent a lot of time recreating in the mountains in the northeastern US. I understand that the mountains there were shaped by the Laurentide Ice Sheet 10k+ years ago. This massive glacier reached all the way down to Long Island in NY State, which I understand is actually a glacial moraine. Today, the nearest glaciers to the region aren't anywhere close (Baffin Island maybe?). 

Conversely, I've also spent time in the Washington Cascades, which are still riddled with glaciers; some sizeable, but most are small in the grand scheme of things. I've been told that these glaciers used to be much larger in Washington, but even at the peak of the Ice Age, glaciers didn't even reach down to some of the valley floors in the eastern Cascades. 

So why is it that the Laurentide Ice Sheet formed and receeded so dramatically over thousands of miles in the northeast US, while the Pacific Northwest merely saw a growing and shrinking of our modern day glaciers? I know glaciers form when annual temperature and snowfall combined to prevent snow from fully melting during the summer. By that logic, the weather patterns over the Ice Sheet must have been wildly different than they are today, even a greater difference than the weather was and is in the PNW today.

But in the latter reference frame, I'm an object dozens of orders of magnitude more massive than the neutrino moving near the speed of light, so I should have an absolutely absurd amount of kinetic energy. Now imagine I bump into another person, or even just move through air particles; at such a speed, the resulting collision should be equivalent to detonating several nuclear weapons. Basically, the question becomes, doesn't the fact that we are not constantly exploding all the time imply that there is a preferred frame of reference, in this case the one in which the neutrino is moving at relativistic speed and I am not?

And furthermore, what happens if a dinosaur bone is fossilized with sandstone sediment? Can the bone themselves be fossilized bones made up of nothing but sandstone?

Text: Hi Reddit! I am a biologist from the University of Maryland here to answer your questions about aging. My research has focused on the molecular mechanisms of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), a premature aging disease, and the potential connections between HGPS and normal aging.

**Kan Cao** is a renowned scientist, anti-aging authority and professor of cell biology and molecular genetics at the University of Maryland. She has been studying human aging and in particular the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome (HGPS), a premature aging disease that claims most victims by age 13. While conducting research on aging and HGPS, Kan's lab discovered that a common dye, methylene blue, had incredible anti-aging properties for human skin. With support from UM Ventures, she started Mblue Labs and launched Bluelene Skincare, the first commercially available methylene blue anti-aging cream.

I'll be on from **1 to 3 p.m. ET (17-18 UT)** - ask me anything!

Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for 'X' were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;.

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field.

Text: Delta IV and Delta IV Heavy sets itself on fire right before takeoff. This is expected behaviour and looks alarming but it's OK, they know it's going to happen and they've made sure the flames won't damage anything. 

The usual explanation is that Delta IV runs hydrogen through the engines early on. The rocket has liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen on board and they don't want excess oxygen to build up in the engines because oxygen is very chemically reactive and could damage the engine. So they run excess hydrogen through the rocket, especially early on. This hydrogen burns in a dramatic looking (but not actually very dangerous) fireball.

But then why don't other rockets set themselves on fire? The Shuttle, Ariane 5, Japan's H-II and China's Long March 5 are all using hydrogen on their first stages but don't set themselves on fire. I get that rockets using kerosene won't have the same fireball issue but why don't all hydrogen fueled rockets have a fireball? 

I feel like it's been explained a hundred times but with only half an explanation. What does Ariane 5 do differently to Delta IV that means one has a fireball and the other doesn't?

There are HUNDREDS of windmills in this one farm, yet only a fraction of them are actually rotating. Why? Why can’t the blades all be in the “on” position and just generate electricity as wind permits?

What/who (I imagine wind patterns and some engineer or AI software) decides which windmills are on? Being there are so many windmills, they’re all slightly varied angles, but there are many examples of two windmills facing the exact same direction, immediately next to each other, and one is on, one is off. Why?!

I must know why windmills are so mystifying!

I know the moon is slowly pulling away from us and making our years longer by a fraction of a second, but how much do those milliseconds add up in 250 million years? I saw a source online saying that in 100 million years it will add half an hour to a day, but I don't know how true this is. If that is true and we would have an extra 1.5 hours per day, would that be that we would basically have 22.8 extra days? (I could be wrong here, math isn't my strong suit)

If anyone can help answer my question that would be greatly appreciated 🙏

For cross-presentation to occur to activate CD8 T cells, do these antigen-presenting cells engulf the whole epithelial cells to get access to the peptide?

I know the infected cells will have the MHC 1 for the cytotoxic T cell to kill them, but how are the T cells activated?

&gt;From April 2-5, 1977, heavy rain fell in the Appalachians. The National Weather Service reports that some areas in West Virginia received **up to 15.5 inches of rain.** This massive amount of rain caused the Tug River to rise to record-setting levels and overflow. Williamson, along with The Mountaineer Hotel, was one of the flood casualties. By April 5th, **water had risen above 53 feet** in downtown Williamson. Waters had reached the mezzanine level, fully encompassing the basement and lobby, of the hotel.  

How is it possible that 15.5 inches of rainfall doesn't translate to 15.5 inches of water level rise? How does it accumulate exponentially?

And of those extinctions, do we know what percentage of these species evolved into something new and their old version died out, as opposed to the old version being wiped out in an evolutionary dead end?

Text: To quote Surf City, if there were “two girls for every boy” wouldn’t there be a big reproductive advantage for the population? Pregnancy takes a long time, but there’s no time constant on men. More pregnancies = more people = a stronger species. Humans have evolved to possess many biological advantages, but the 50/50 ratio of men and women seems like a missed opportunity.

Text: Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for 'X' were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;.

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

My body has always been very warm, so I don't dress in as many layers as some people do. I live in a not-so-warm region (Eastern Europe). 

**I wonder whether if when I'm on a bulk it would matter if I did put on more clothing - would that make my body use less energy to make the temperature that it's used to maintaining?** 

Wondering whether dressing in more layers could compensate for a slightly lesser caloric intake. 

**Also, conversly, would dressing in less layers help losing body weight due to increased energy expenditure?**

Thanks in advance for any and all serious answers!

Text: I'm Katrina Miller, a New York Times reporter covering space, physics, and the intersection of science and society. In 2023, I earned my Ph.D. in particle physics from the University of Chicago. I reported the [&quot;ring of fire&quot; eclipse](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/14/homepage/solar-eclipse-photos.html) in October from Richfield, Utah. Leading up to the event on Monday, I've spoken to [residents in the crossroads of the 2017 and 2024 solar eclipses](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/30/science/total-solar-eclipse-illinois-midwest.html), created a [guide](https://www.nytimes.com/article/total-solar-eclipse.html) for how to have the best experience under totality, covered the science of eclipses, and more. I'll be down in Carbondale, Illinois on April 8, and it'll be the first total solar eclipse I get to experience in person.

I'm Patricia Reiff, a Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy and the founding Director of the [Rice Space Institute](https://rsi.rice.edu/) at Rice University. My research focuses on space plasma physics, mostly in the area of magnetospheric physics: &quot;space weather,&quot; which I've been covering for 50 years. I am also a partner of the [NASA Heliophysics Education Activation Team](https://science.nasa.gov/learn/heat/), and have created immersive educational clips for use in planetarium domes. I recently released a show called [MAGNETISM](https://mms.rice.edu/mms_planetarium_show.html) and another called Totality! and have created eleven educational clips on solar and lunar eclipses.

Ask us anything about the significance of the solar eclipse and physics. We'll start answering questions at **2 p.m. ET (18 UT)**.

Text: Recently I had a strange experience. Just before dusk, I spotted a bright star in the sky for 20-30 minutes, completely still the whole time. It was the only star visible at this time, and by far. It was very bright, and appeared to be much farther out than earth's orbit. While outside, more and more satellites came into my view, until I could see at least 20 at once. As it gets darker, more stars appear, but the original bright star that was still begins to start traveling the same direction as the satellites, to the west, slightly north. It was traveling almost the exact same speed as the satellites, but would take occasional pauses in the sky for a few seconds. I did a google search of the ISS location and movement around this time. It was stated as possibly visibly during that week, but was only supposed to be visible for \~10 minutes.

My question, can the ISS stay still in the sky? For 20-30 minutes? And would it be in my view for about an hour total? Can it start and stop moving at will?

Text: To my understanding, a solar eclipse is caused by the Moon, at the new moon phase, positioning itself between the Earth and the Sun and casting a shadow on Earth. On that shadow is where we can see the solar eclipse happening. Therefore, if you were capable of being in any position of space at any moment (without inmediately asphyxiating, freezing and dying like, idk, Superman), and in a normal day of the week you positioned yourself a set distance from the Moon with the Sun behind it, right where the shadow the Sun casts is, could you not see a solar eclipse?

If one were to stay on the ISS indefinitely *(lets pretend the effects of micro-gravity isn't a problem)* how long would it take for them to die? What would be the first thing to fail in your body or develop cancer as a result?


Would you get superpowers? /s


Last question *(This one is more of an engineering question)* how much lead shielding would you need to protect Astronauts on the ISS? Would it make more sense to make them wear lead apron suits like they put on you at the dentist, or would that not hardly be enough? *(I mean, the weight would hardly be a problem since they'd be in micro-gravity)* It'd at least make sense to have lead *&quot;sleeves&quot;* on their sleeping bags, right?

P.S. There really needs to be a nuclear/radiological flair tag on this sub. I really have no idea where this should go.

Text: On April 8, 2024, the moon will pass between the sun and the Earth, creating a total solar eclipse. The path of totality will stretch from Mexico to Maine.

It's the last total solar eclipse visible from the contiguous United States until Aug. 23, 2044. On average, any given location experiences a total solar eclipse once every 375 years.

Joel Achenbach is a science writer on the Post's National Desk. He joined the Post's Style section in 1990 after eight years at The Miami Herald. He wrote the syndicated column Why Things Are, an online-only column Rough Draft for [washingtonpost.com](http://washingtonpost.com/) and later, while working for the Sunday magazine, created the newsroom's first blog,

Matthew Cappucci is a meteorologist for The Washington Post's Capital Weather Gang, as well as for the MyRadar app and various TV outlets. He is an avid storm chaser and self-proclaimed &quot;umbraphile,&quot; and has traveled thousands of miles chasing solar eclipses. Cappucci graduated in 2019 with a B.A. in atmospheric sciences at Harvard. Nowadays, he can be found roaming the Great Plains in an armored truck dodging hailstones the size of softballs while chasing after tornadoes. His second book, &quot;Extreme Weather for Kids,&quot; just came out.

Text: It seems that there was, in some locations such as Europe, a large-scale 'replacement' of native populations by Yamnaya or Indo-Europeans. The closest analogue in modern times we have is the European peopling of the Americas, with diseases like Smallpox being a huge component to the course of events. Could smallpox, itself, have been responsible? Would it have had a significant impact on urbanized centers during the Bronze age that may have contributed to the worldwide 'Bronze Age Collapse'?

Even more so now since COVID, I find the idea of how disease has impacted human culture so fascinating and underappreciated. I'd love to learn more about it.

 Making a couplement of proud compare
 With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems:
 With April's first-born flowers and all things rare,
 That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
 O let me true in love but truly write,

 Let them say more that like of hearsay well,
 I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
