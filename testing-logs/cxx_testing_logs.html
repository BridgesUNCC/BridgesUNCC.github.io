Text: Let's say you leave a glass of water on a table. Over time, would you expect the water molecules to move around or would they tend to stay in the same relative position in the glass? I imagine there could be random walk behaviour where in each unit of time an individual molecule has a small chance of being jostled out of its position and pushed up or down.

Text: I've seen a couple stories recently wondering if the atmospheric rivers hitting the West Coast will end the drought. While they might refill reservoirs, recharging the water tables will take more than a single season.

There are efforts to sequester CO2 underground. Fracking is successful, in part, because of the top secret toxic mixture they pump into the shale to fracture it and increasing oil/gas flow.

In a similar fashion, could aquifers be actively recharged, speeding up that process? If so, are there any feasibility studies underway to investigate this idea?

Text: Most articles I've read on the matter estimate that between 80-95% of individuals that achieve major weight loss regain most or all of the weight down the road, typically within a couple years. Many people, in fact, will become heavier than they were originally. 

It seems that more and more articles are released every week discussing the seemingly &quot;irreversible&quot; metabolic impact of being obese and remaining obese for an extended period of time. 

That got me wondering, if the duration of obesity likely impacts long-term (potentially life-long) metabolic function, could the inverse be true as well? 

Could there be a critical period of time that a formerly obese person must maintain their weight loss before their normal metabolic function recovers or will they always have &quot;obesity in remission?&quot;

Does anyone know of any long-term studies that address this question?

EDIT (17:30): It just occurred to me, many people that lose large amounts of fat tend to lose a significant amount of lean muscle mass as well. I wonder if this may explain some or most of the loss in metabolism observed in some studies or if that's just a gross oversimplification

Does it have something to do with the speed at which leishmania can reproduce?

Why is there an AIDS pandemic but not a leishmaniasis pandemic?

Text:  Hello, this thing is completely destroying my brain.

HCO3- in renal tubules is &quot;reabsorved&quot; into the circulatory system through a bunch of reactions involving the carbonic anhydrase.

Basically:

\- It combines with H+ forming CO2 + H2O, that can enter the tubular cells;

\- The reverse reaction happens inside these cells: forming HCO3- + H+. The HCO3- is reabsorved into the blood, and the H+ goes back to the renal tubules to restart the cycle with another HCO3-.

I dont get how this is supposed to eliminate H+. Isn't the H+ net equal to 0 ?

Also, how does this make the pH higher? If it reabsorbs the HCO3-, then the H+ used wont be eliminated and vice versa, so I don't see how any of these actions (one or another) could make the pH higher.

Text: It's well known that having a meal before consuming alcohol (ethanol in this context) slows down its absorption into the bloodstream. A quick google search pegs this at 50% reduced maximum BAC level compared to consuming alcohol on an empty stomach. Without chemistry knowledge, one might be inclined to believe that just about all of the alcohol eventually reaches the bloodstream.

I found out today that ethanol reacts with organic fats (carboxylics only?) to form esters, which do not appear to act like ethanol in the body.

My question is, is this likely to result in a significant decrease in the total amount of ethanol that eventually reaches the blood? If a person ate a fatty meal before drinking, is it possible this could reduce the bioavailability of the ethanol (if that's the right term) by &gt;20%?

Text: [NASA's InSight lander](https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/) sent its last transmission on Dec. 15, 2022, after more than four years of unique science work. The spacecraft - which landed on Mars in 2018 - detected 1,319 [marsquakes](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-insight-records-monster-quake-on-mars), gathered data on the [Red Planet's crust, mantle, and core](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-insight-reveals-the-deep-interior-of-mars), and even captured the sounds of [meteoroid impacts](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-insight-hears-its-first-meteoroid-impacts-on-mars) miles away on the Martian surface.

So, have you ever wanted to know how operating a lander on Mars is different from a rover? Or how engineers practice mission operations in an [indoor Mars lab here on Earth](https://youtu.be/q9NptmKlXms)? How about what we might still learn from InSight's data in the months and years to come?

Meet six team experts from NASA and other mission partners who've seen it all with this mission, from efforts to get InSight's heat probe (or &quot;mole&quot;) into the Martian surface to the marsquakes deep within the planet.

We are:

+ Phil Bailey (PB) - Operations lead for the robotic arm and cameras. Also worked with InSight's Earthly twin, ForeSight, at NASA JPL's In-Situ Instrument Laboratory.
+ Kathya Zamora Garcia (KG) - Mission manager for InSight, also helped clean InSight's solar arrays with Martian dirt.
+ Troy Hudson (TH) - A former instrument systems engineer and anomaly response team lead for the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Probe, known as &quot;the mole.&quot;
+ Mark Panning (MP) - Project scientist for InSight, specializing in planetary seismology.
+ Emily Stough (ES) - Led surface operations for InSight.
+ Brett White (BW) - Power subsystem and energy management lead with Lockheed Martin, which helped build the lander.

Ask us anything about:

+ How InSight worked
+ Marsquakes
+ How the interiors of Mars, Earth and the Moon compare and differ
+ Meteoroid impacts
+ Martian weather
+ InSight's legacy

We'll be online from 12-1:30 p.m. PT (3-4:30 p.m. ET, 20-21:30 UT) to answer your questions!

Usernames: /u/nasa

UPDATE 1:30 p.m. PT: That’s all the time we have for today - thank you all for your amazing questions! If you’d like to learn more about InSight, you can visit mars.nasa.gov/insight.

Text: I'll start by saying that this is probably caused by my own lack of knowledge on the subject.  


I hear and read time and time again how it is impossible to know the position and velocity of X particle in a system and how that makes the universe nondeterministic. But as far as I'm concerned that is not a natural law but a restriction caused by our own inability to observe those data points without influencing the system ourselves.  


If in the future there was a way to measure such systems without interfering with them, would that negate the uncertainty principle?   


Or is it instead a natural law that will remain true (If the math holds up) no matter how far science advances?   


Thanks for your answers!

But how can this be explained with a wave model as the dark bands (where waves &quot;cancel&quot; each other) would seem to say the energy from each wave just disappears at those spots? 

 (Whereas in Quantum Mechanics, I assume you would say the photons just don't hit those spots, but all photons do hit somewhere.  Which is also quite odd but at least consistent with energy conservation.)

Everything in the Arctic or Antarctic has intricate crinkly edges: Svalbard, Ellesmere, the Falklands, the Kerguelen Islands.

Tropical islands look totally different, smooth and rounded: Sri Lanka, Barbados, Nauru.

Why's that?

Text: Hello. I was having a discussion with a friend about snakes and how they go about digesting their food. We kept using the frame of reference that food goes in through our mouths, then through the digestive tracks of the stomach, then eventually out. We figured snakes were the same way, except their digestive tracks are part of their elongated bodies.

Then I started wondering, does food go in one direction then? Is it through the mouth, then slowly pushing toward the tail, where their output mechanism gets rid of it? Or is it through time, the food shifts from going outward towards the tail and upward towards the head, almost like a thrashing, until the food is broken up enough to exit the system?

I'm not sure of these answers. This might be a dumb question on my part. Just curious though.

How do snakes digest their food?

Do snakes use a more powerful acid they have to break down food than humans have?  Is there a rate at which the average snake passes food matter from one stage to the next? If so, how does that rate compare with humans, as its a smaller system?

I'd figure if that were the case, it would be a shorter time span to eat and output waste for a snake, than it is a human, but then again, that could be wrong, maybe its not relative to the size of the system, but the differences in the digestion process from snake to human and back. Who knows?

Might as well ask yall though lol. I'm not a herpetologist but one of you biology folks might be.

Text: I know how to calculate a torque (force times distance) but I don’t understand what it means to torque a screw to a specific torque. For example, if a screw is torqued to 7 in-lbs, does that mean the screw will not come loose until I apply a load of 1 pound 7 inches away from the screw/7 pounds of force 1 inch away from the screw? In order to have a screw torqued to 7 in-lbs, do I apply a load of 1 pound 7 inches away until it no longer rotates?

It was explained how people expect that we simply receive input to our retinas and we make sense of it and then give meaning to it, or something along the lines.

However, it was stated that we receive input to our retinas and this input is used to check against an already formed expectation of what we are &quot;supposed&quot; to be seeing.

Text: I understand that most cameras use a colour filter array to measure the intensity of a single colour of light (Red, Green, Blue) at each photosite on the sensor, and that the Bayer CFA is the most common colour array, then an algorithm calculates RGB values for each pixel based on averages from the surrounding pixels. But how do they know which pixels are red, green or blue? Is the filter array aligned on the sensor with enough precision to know the exact colour of the filter above each pixel, or is there some element of the demosaicing algorithm that allows them to work out the filter above each pixel after production? Or is each sensor calibrated during production to locate the red, green and blue pixels?

and next ...  can you squeeze 2 neutrons together to form a black hole?  
but next.... can you squeeze 1 neutron together (the quarks in it) to become a black hole?  
and even next.....  if the previous is true, than in fact a quark is a black hole on itself...  Or a quark is composed of even smaller particles that can be squeezed together to form yet another even smaller black hole....  
But if that is true, these smaller particles are black holes on their own, and that is not possible...

Benn's video implies that the subjective perception of motion, and pitch of sound change for animals with varying levels of &quot;Critical flicker-fusion frequency&quot;.

I understand that they work to reduce appetite and slow the digestion of food. But how is it that they do this? And why are these drugs seemingly so much more effective than other appetite suppressants that we've developed in the past? Everything just mentions that they slow the digestion of food and that leads to weight loss, but this feels like an incomplete explanation. Presumably other drugs have been able to suppress appetite, so ultimately my question is if some other mechanism is at play.

Text: This fall, I watched a pumpkin on my pumpkin plant die while it was still firmly attached to the vine. I just kind of let it rot there because maybe the seeds from it will come back next year.

It was pretty nasty. It smelled bad, there were a lot of flies, and I could see the flesh of the fruit rotting

So how does a pumpkin plant (or other fruiting plant) protect itself against pathogens that may be on a rotting piece of itself? Are there strong immune system enablers in parts of the plant that bear fruit?

But what about sexual reproduction - how did we go from one creature splitting in half to 2 creatures reproducing together? How did the intermediate stages work in that case (specifically, how did lifeforms that were in the process of evolving sex reproduce)? I get the advantages like variation and mutations.

Text: **Please read this entire post carefully and format your application appropriately.**

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/w3rut0/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxvii/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).
* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)
* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)
* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?
* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

\-------------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

`Username: /u/foretopsail`

`General field: Anthropology`

`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`

`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`

`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`

`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

You can submit your application by replying to this post.

I tried treading up on this, but I'm not a physicist and I'm only familiar with QM on a podcast / youtube video level so I'm looking for a more intuitive explanation on why this happens and how this is derived.

- Does the existence of a magnetic monopole imply that the magnetic charge is also quantized?
- Is this a fundamental explanation on why things are quantum in nature or do we have to go deeper than that?

Text: I'd like to start by explaining how I see evolution takes place.

So, small mutations are occurring with every new generation. The new offspring will have new genetics and will progress the evolution.

But in order for these new mutations to spread, that individual needs to have new offspring. Hope I got it so far, please correct me if I'm wrong.

Now, we come to the difference between apes and humans, in terms of chromosome count. We know that at some point 2nd chromosomes fused and we got 1 less pair.

So, my question is, how did this mutation propagate, if species with different chromosome count cant interbreed? Let's say an offspring is born with this new mutation, and he has his/her chromosome fused. First of all, he will most likely look/behave differently than the rest of the tribe, reducing his chance of survival. Second, he would require a peer with the same mutation to interbreed with and spread this mutation. I can see this process unfolding in species that have hundreds of offspring (like laying a bunch of eggs with a lot of them having the same mutation), but can't imagine that in an environment that produces a handful of offspring every now and then.

Text: As the title mentions, based on casual observation, it seems to me that the effective dose of most medicine active ingredients is somewhere between 5 mg and 200 mg. There are of course exceptions like fentanyl which is incredibly potent at the scale of micrograms, and gabapentin, which is often dosed at over 1000 mg, but it seems like most medications are within a narrower range I mention above. This is surprising given vastly different molecular structures of the different medications.

My first question is, is my observation empirically accurate? Or, am I just noticing a non-representative subset of medications?

My second question is, if this is true, why? I know the range i mentioned is pretty large, but it seems narrow when considering total physically possible ranges? Why don’t we see more medications with effective dosages at the microgram scale?

One possibility that occurred to me- is this just a matter of practicality? Consuming multiple grams of medication, although possible, is inconvenient. Similarly, maybe its more expensive to manufacture super potent compounds because of the precision it requires. Are companies just choosing to develop products that work in a more convenient dosing range?

Another possibility that occurred to me- is there some law of chemistry or factor in our biology that makes this the ideal dosage range for many different compounds? E.g., the size of molecules limits potency, the body has some process that clears de minimis amounts of a compound, the average human weight somehow necessitates medications usually be in this range, etc.?

This question has been driving me crazy, so thanks to anyone who can provide some insight.

if you did this regularly, would your immune system be better able to tackle real issues in the future? If so, why don't we do this? and if it wouldn't help, why?

edit: no im obviously not asking about vaccines. I'm not talking about vaccines created to train our immune system against a specific virus.

I'm asking if you're immune system will grow general defenses from simply allowing minor infections.

would strengthening your immune system against generic infections in paper cuts have any benefit to your immune systems abilities to fight other infections? Is there a limit to how *trained* your immune system can be for infection in general? or a specific infection? or specific types of infection?

ok so fine let's ask something about vaccines then. I've had all the generic vaccines that most people do. does that make my immune system better at fighting viruses in general? or only the ones I'm specifically vaxxed for.

For example - in 1930 testosterone normal level in the population is 10 units . So when you have a blood test the normal range is 8-12. 

In 2020 the normal level is 4 units, so the normal range has been adjusted to 2-6

I hope I am making sense, and I really hope to get an answer. To me this makes no sense. For sure adjustments are made based on better science, but not because the population is becoming unhealthier?

For an external combustion engine, is there any reason you would prefer cold air to hot air? As in, would air temperature affect the energy output of burning a fuel? Assuming 100% heat transfer from the fire to the boiler, can you make these engines more efficient by controlling the air temperature?

Text: Last night my family and I were debating how the light moves from the electricity (or plasma, whichever makes the electromagnetic radiation) to our eyes whenever lightning strikes.

I proposed that if the light didn't scatter through the droplets and atmosphere, then all we would see is the strike itself and the sky would remain dark. So I was imagining that refraction between water and air as well as internal reflection of the droplets is what causes the light to reach our eyes, not that the sky lights up like a light bulb does.

I also argued that different points on Earth would receive varying levels of light from each strike because of the random nature of water droplets and the structure they happen to form at that moment. So whether a particular strike is bright depends on where you are, not just the amount of energy released. (because different places would receive different numbers of rays, so the sky looks a different brightness. Kinda like how the moon always reflects along a body of water in the direction of the observer, each point gets varying directions of electromagnetic waves)
. This is kinda what I want fact-checked the most.



P.s. I couldn't find anything useful online, just generic &quot;oh, lightning occurs when clouds polarise&quot; and nothing about the path of the light.

Text: Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Biology, Chemistry, Neuroscience, Medicine, Psychology**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for 'X' were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;.

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

PostTime: 1674096136

Text: Background:

Friend says turbo engines (typically) run lower *compression ratio* than naturally aspirated engines, and concluded turbocharged engines don't require as high of octane as an NA engine of the same compression ratio.

From my experience with ECU tuning, I know that maximum Manifold Absoulute pressure is often (roughly) double in turbo engines compared to NA (NA is retricted to atmospheric pressure: 1ATM/~14.7psi/~1013mbar)

Question:

*Assume all variables &amp; designs (power, fuel economy, displacement) are the same *EXCEPT* for compression ratio, peak MA pressure (MAP), and means of induction.*

Does a turbocharged engine produce higher cylinder pressure than a naturally aspirated engine?

Additional question:

Assume the same scenario as above, but now compare at an equivalent MA pressure. Say both engines cylinder pressure is measured when both engines are at 1ATM (maximum MAP for NA, but typically half maximum MAP for a turbo engine)

In this scenario, which engine will have a higher cylinder pressure?

Text: In particular, what do evidence-based studies say about the effectiveness of the bivalent vaccines against currently-circulating variants for those who have previously had the primary series, the original booster, and who have subsequently had COVID-19. Some previous data suggested that there's a short term (few weeks) boost in antibody titers of a similar magnitude to those seen with the original wild-type booster, but that those gains quickly evaporate back to a baseline antibody level from prior to the bivalent booster. Is there data separating the short and longer term benefits in terms of both transmission protection and hospitalization/death prevention? Bonus points for studies containing data specific to children and pregnant women.

My wife is pregnant (Yey!). She struggles with nausea and tiredness, and everything doctors say is normal during the first trimester. In addition, she is scared about the possibility of miscarriage, complications and, in general, medical difficulties that could endanger her health (and the baby's health). She has been reading a lot about how, in the past, many women died because of pregnancy complications or while giving birth. Today, we wondered: is that kind of thing normal in animals? 

I have never heard someone mention, &quot;oh yes, my dog died because of pregnancy complications&quot;. I have never heard of that happening in wild animals. Maybe I am incredibly ignorant because I live in a city, but I am curious if other animals also have some rough times with pregnancy.

Is that the case? Or is it simply that we humans are weak?

Text: We have a million different antibiotics options available in the market. And whenever someone gets a bacterial infection, we pretty much always treat it with antibiotics.

But there are only a handful of antivirals available, and even then, 99% of viral infections I’ve seen are treated by medicating the symptoms and getting bed rest until your body itself takes care of the virus.

Why are antibacterials so common and widely used, while antivirals are basically unseen? Is it something to do with their effectiveness, or how hard it is to manufacture them?

Text: Hi! My name is Tareq Abu Hamed. I am originally from East Jerusalem, and I hold a PhD in chemical engineering from Ankara University. I did my first post doctorate research at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, where I worked at the Environmental Sciences and Energy Research Department. My second post doctorate was at the University of Minnesota, at the Solar Energy Laboratory of the Mechanical Engineering Department. I have published in a wide variety of journals and have received several awards for my research, including the Dan David Prize. Previously, I served as the Deputy Chief Scientist and the Director of Engineering Research at The Ministry of Science, Technology and Space. I also established the Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation at the Arava Institute. I am currently the Executive Director of the Arava Institute and a researcher at the Dead Sea and Arava Science Center.

You can read about my role as Deputy Chief Scientist here: https://www.haaretz.com/science-and-health/2015-03-22/ty-article/east-jlem-palestinian-tapped-deputy-chief-scientist/0000017f-e34c-d568-ad7f-f36f0f2a0000

The Middle East is a global hot spot for climate change and environmental stress on water, energy, agriculture, health and other necessities. Many cities in our region are predicted to become uninhabitable by the end of the century. In recognition of this pressing reality, the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies is conducting a variety of academic and research projects that combines regional environmental diplomatic activity, academic research, and the initiation and execution of projects throughout the Middle East.

One of our great projects is Methuselah. Methuselah is a date palm that Dr. Elaine Solowey sprouted from a 2,000-year-old date seed. This seed, among others, was found during the excavations of Masada in the mid 1960's. In 2005, several of these seeds were obtained by the Louis L. Borick Natural Medicine Research Center of the Hadassah Medical Organization, which gave them to Dr. Elaine Solowey at the Center for Sustainable Agriculture. Dr. Solowey successfully germinated one of these seeds, which sprouted into a young date palm.

Initially thought to be botanically impossible, this successful project has been featured in the New York Times, National Geographic, and other publications. Today, Methuselah has a permanent home in the Arava Institute research park on Kibbutz Ketura.

When I view my part with a thermal camera,  I can see the electrical bits are all at the temperature that I would expect.  But the metal housing for the part is closer to 85C.  The unit was in the chamber for over an hour, so it should have been “soaked” by that time.  

I was talking to a coworker and he said that the hot air in the chamber was cooling the part because it was flowing.  But that didn’t make sense to me because I would think that air at 105C would make everything about 105C.  Why does hot air cool metal and reduce the temperature of the metal to below the temperature of the hot air?

Text: Hi there. I am not a geologist, and most of my knowledge has come from seminars on soils or reading online sources. So I am here to ask a question of geologists that I am having trouble finding online.

Lithification of marine sediments appears to be the most common process in the creation of sedimentary rock. It's quite easy to find information on this. However, I have found very little information on whether there are terrestrial processes that create sedimentary rock on land. One could assume that the relative absence of information means it doesn't happen, but I don't want to assume that just because I can't easily find the information means it doesn't happen. So, are there any types of sedimentary rock that form in terrestrial environments, and what are the processes? I have read about cements and conglomerates, are those typically the only ones?

Generally it seems that lithification happens in marine environments, the rock is then uplifted into the terrestrial environment, where it then erodes back to the sea. Does lithification generally not happen on land because the accumulation of new sediment is not enough to replace or overtake sediment loss to erosion?

I'd appreciate any pieces of information or sources on this. Thanks!

Text: I think this is a science question because it's about a natural process. Seriously, where do bears go to hibernate? I'm assuming they instinctually go for safe places where they won't be bothered or affected by weather, and perhaps places that are relatively warm and solitary. I've been led by Hollywood to believe bears hibernate exclusively in caves, but I've lived in places with lots of bears and it's flat forest land as far as the eye can see (Florida). I know there are limestone cave systems, but they're far and few between in most places. I'm just wondering where else in the woods is a good, safe, warm, sheltered, protected, viable place for them to go to sleep for 6 months. Thickets? Fallen tree mounds? Do they dig holes for themselves?Unless they all crowd in together there just aren't enough caves for all of them! Where do the beers sleep???

Seems that not having to use it's own reentry vehicle would reduce mission costs, or allow for more or bigger scientific equipment to be carried on the probe.

Am I mistaken here or would this not be a nice effective use of having a continuously manned space vehicle in orbit?

So, are their mechanisms the same as ours? Is there any mechanism exclusive to plants? In which case, could we technically implement it in animals as well or understand cancer better?

Text: I might be misunderstanding the concept, but:

If the goldilocks zone is just the sweet spot away from a star that could sustain life, is it possible for that zone to shift as the star goes through different life stages? Or possibly life might evolve differently at different distances?

Does this have a place in our modern understanding?

Update/Follow Up Question: There seems to be a consensus in the thread that this is a valid concept. So...could that mean...we evolved as scientists think we did but maybe we did that on another planet in our our system and had to move to Earth when the goldilocks zone shifted? 

....maybe? Even in a &quot;plausible sci fi&quot; way?

Or is the change over too many billions of years to make any sense?

If you do a long, low intensity workout where your body predominantly uses fat as its fuel source, will your body fat percentage be lower when you’re done? Is your body burning fat for fuel the same thing as when it loses fat due to a calorie deficit?

Text: The question is a bit hectic but I wasn't sure how to word it properly.

Basically if we consider bacteria and viruses causing illness in humans, are they present for so long only because there was always someone to &quot;pass it on&quot;?

In other words, if we were lucky enough to get to a point where nobody would be infected by smallpox, would that mean the end of smallpox? I know there are of course things like the bacteria being able to survive without a host for some time on contaminated surfaces, etc., but hosts remain their main way of survival, right?

The thought that brought me to this question was whether the wide range of diseases we know today exists because we were never lucky enough for nobody to be infected by that specific bacteria for example.

3) Since deserts are made of sand can they change collocation in time?
4) Lastly if we took the sand from alla deserts in the world could we theoretically fill the Mediterranean Sea?

Again I'm sorry if these sound stupid, i'm just really curious about deserts for no peculiar reason.

These same fishermen claim that the resulting slurry stays cold much LONGER than just a cooler of ice without the salt. They've done no experiments with timing it, they just make the claim.

I understand the salt melting the ice, and the resulting slurry being partially liquid and the liquid being as cold as the solid.  What I don't understand, or even BELIEVE, without some explanation is that he mass would stay cool LONGER in one form or another.  It's as if they're saying that by adding salt, they've removed even more energy (heat) from the mass.

Sounds wrong to me.  Am I missing something?

Is it an algorithm that differentiates between the movement of the base, user, or instrument and the ground? And how does it build this predictive modeling to accommodate for this?

Text: Hi,

Let's suppose we have a very long stick with astronomical length in the range of light years or similar.

This question has been proposed before but I wish to hear clarification on some facts that aren't clear to me.

If we push the stick 10 cm, does it mean the stick is 10 cm shorter before the push reaches the other end?

Is the strength we would have to apply to do that only the strength necessary to move the stick with its given length and mass or is it also needed to add additional force to transiently deform it if the previous question is yes?

So can we form complex wave form light? Does this happen naturally?

* Does a refraction grating separate out different wavelength photons, or act like a physical Fourier transform on complicated waveforms?

Text: I guess it's obvious what I'm referring to, i.e. current events over Montana.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_China_balloon_incident

The thing is up in the stratosphere, higher than most planes (and certainly rotor/propeller aircraft) can reach.

I haven't found any discussion of this question online, and I'm sorry if this isn't strictly a 'science' question but there *is* an &quot;Engineering&quot; flair, so I'm giving it a shot.

How could a device like this be brought down without destroying it (as I understand it's hard enough to *destroy* it)? What means are available for capturing a large high-altitude balloon carrying a ton of electronics equipment?

*edit 2 days later*

It sounds like the answer is &quot;wait till it's over the ocean, pop the balloon with a missile fired from an F-22, then pick the wreckage out of the water&quot;.

Now I wondered why that could be and I figured that it must be a combination of my peripheral vision picking up light easier and my peripheral experiencing the same phenomenon that sometimes occurs with cameras.

Text: I'm sitting on my thesis for my history class for uni and analyzing some old local policies from 1718 (from a city government in Palatinate, germany) , which told the citizens to bring a light source with them if they wanted to go outside after a specific point in time in the evening. I was a little bit confused about the determined point of time, being 10pm in summer and 8pm in winter. I thought, why would they set the time that late in winter? Where I live in December at 5pm it's already dark outside. Why force the people to carry a lightsource not until 8pm? Why not already at 5pm when it's already dark especially without having electrical light at that time. That applies to the summer time as well? Why having to bring a lit lantern at 10pm when there is still enough daylight so you wouldn't need a lantern. At least from todays perspective. And on top of that it's even more confusing if you take in account that we have winter and summer time. In the past winter time would be the normal time (UTC+1). Hence my question: How consistent is  the yearly cycle of varying daylight duration from day to day throughout the year in a historical view? Was it the same in 16th century as today? Did it change throughout the millenia? And if so, how much did it change?

How do these viruses stay in the body?

I think I read before that the physical virus 'unit' doesn't stay in the body but after the first infection the genome/DNA for such virus is now integrated with yours and replicates anyway, only normally the genes are not expressed enough for symptoms or for cells to begin producing full viruses?           (Maybe im wrong).

Text: I was wondering why are for example baboons in the research of transplantion the &quot;standard&quot;? Why not others ? I understand that we share huge part of our genome with rhesus monkeys (depending on the source up to 95%) but we do as well (if not even more, up to 99%) with chimpanzees and I don't have the impression they are as widely used in biomedical research. Or did I get a wrong impression cause I haven't read as much about other fields ? My backgorund lies in immunology.

Text: When most people think of tick-borne illnesses, the first thing that comes to mind is usually Lyme disease. Yet its closely-related cousin relapsing fever, while not as prevalent, has actually been foundational in the study of vector-borne diseases. Largely unknown today, the story of relapsing fever is a fascinating exploration of scientific research that contains important lessons for modern medicine.

Join us today at 2 PM ET (19 UT) for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), all about relapsing fever. We hope to shine a light on the mechanism and biology of relapsing fever, and to highlight how research on forgotten and ignored diseases can have real impact on health and medical advances.

With us today are:

+ Dr. Phil Stewart, Ph.D. (u/Mercurialdrifter)- Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health.
+ Dr. Tom Schwan, Ph.D. (u/Argasidae)- Special Volunteer, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health.

Text: Hey guys, Lebanese citizen here. After that scare in the middle of the night from the Earthquake in Turkey, my body has not stopped shaking, we felt it immensely here and it has been incredibly saddening to see our Turkish and Syrian fellows deal with such tragic circumstances. 

I hate to post this because it feels so selfish, but news media here are spreading so much contradicting information and I am freaking out honestly. Can someone please explain if all the aftershocks from the Earthquake (some we feel some we don't), can cause some activity in our area that can lead to a devastating earthquake because our buildings here are almost all unequipped and it would be impossible for us to cope with, I fear so much for my families and younger siblings to experience something like that god forbid. 

Please can anyone give me some reassurance or anything about if the aftershocks cause more or less stability in the area? Or anything else I need to know please. Thanks so much!

Text: I know you might think this can be Googled, but the more I look into it, the more confused I get lol. So haematopoietic stem cells become either myeloid or lymphoid stem cells yes? And all blood cells come from either of those? Here’s the confusing bit - my lecturer said that myeloid = neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils, and lymphoid = T &amp; B cells, monocytes, and NK cells, but when I Google it I get contradictory responses. 

Some sites say myeloid cells become all types of blood cells including red ones &amp; platelets, apart from lymphocytes which come from lymphoid cells. So, does that make monocytes and NK cells types of lymphocytes? When I look into that it just starts telling me that dendritic cells and macrophages are both actually monocytes, which confuses things further. Returning to the original point though, some sites directly state that monocytes come from myeloid cells, which is the complete opposite of the lecture material. Can anyone clear this up for me please?

They got a lot of bad press after both were seen as giving athletes unfair advantages, but I don't think we should let that get in the way of a medicine that has its uses.

The longer it takes for a graft to heal, the greater chance a patient can re-injure it.

Edit: Found an interesting paper on the topic that AAS improve recovery time: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34982051/

But I imagine the stigma of a roided out patient prevents widespread clinical use.

Text: Hi all,

MRI scans tend to take around 20 minutes of operation to get the data versus an x-ray (5 seconds) or CT (10 minutes or so). I understand (to a small extent) that the MRI creates a magnetic field that aligns the proton and then when the magnet is then switched off it detects the movements of these protons back to their original state to draw the picture. Why though does this take 20mins? Is it doing this multiple times or just one long charge/release?

Text: I'm particularly interested Urushiol, the substance in Poison Oak/Ivy/Sumac that many people are allergic to.  
My understanding is that repeated exposure to some substances can cause someone to become allergic to it. However, repeated exposure to that same substance can make you immune, or at least non-reactive.   
I'm also not sure of the difference between being immune &amp; being non-reactive? I have read that only 0.5% of the population is truly immune to Poison Oak, while the rest who don't get it are only non-reactive, but can become reactive to it later.   


Lastly, Urushiol is made of a benzene ring with a hydrocarbon tail. I have read that the benzene ring in Poison Oak, Poison Ivy, &amp; Poison Sumac all have the same benzene ring, but slightly different hydrocarbon tail lengths. Would the different hydrocarbon tail lengths be enough to be allergic to one but not the other?  
Can someone help me understand this better? Thanks.

Text: Currently there are pictures floating around Reddit of how the earthquakes in Turkey resulted in a fault line visually having shifted several meters.

What would happen to a person standing right on the edge of this?

Most images show one side moved (like the traintracks one showing the tracks didn't shift on one side, yet having moved several meters on the other side).

So, extended:

* What would happen to a person standing on the moving side.
* What would happen to a person standing on the side that didn't move.

Considering even a whales call can cause physical damage to a person if they get to close, I'm suspecting the release of energy alone isn't particularly healthy, no matter which side you're standing.

Additionally, are there any  known cases of a person or telemetry device experiencing this?

I know diseases like HIV are thought to come from primates, which makes sense: we're so closely related. But H5N1 infecting humans, sea lions, and _birds_? Sea lions are in an entirely different order from us, and birds in an entirely different class! All having distinct and sophisticated immune systems (at least I think birds have sophisticated immune systems?)

Is H5N1 atypical in terms of how it can cause infection in so many radically different species? Or are the animals infected by H5N1 more similar than I realize?

Text: Hi, I'm doing research for fun stuff.

From my understanding of [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-14199-x) article from Nature, the impact winter after the K-Pg meteor was caused by soot (and/or sulfur) in the atmosphere reducing sunlight penetration. And that the 10-ish years of the impact winter was much more responsible for the extinction event than the impact itself (ie. the sonic waves and tsunamis and heat and magnitude 11 earthquake and stuff).

I would like to figure out exactly what the timeline was for the world's recovery after K-Pg. This stuff is surprisingly hard to find, I swear.

I found a [figure](https://www.space.com/36239-dinosaur-killing-asteroid-strike-chicxulub-life-return.html) that said it took 30,000 years for the first microbes to start showing back up again. That feels weird. Why did the article say that the climate would be returned to normal after 10ish years but it still took 30,000 years for microbe life to return?

How long was it before the first big trees? How long until everything was more or less &quot;back to normal&quot; in terms of the presence of flora? Are we talking, like, 200 years or 200,000? At what point after K-Pg could I walk outside and see a green landscape?

Is this number different for fauna? Like, what's the earliest we saw animals thriving again?

I'm going crazy. If you're an expert I'd appreciate book recommendations or articles and whatnot. Point me in the right direction so I don't have to keep hasslin' you :)

EDIT 2: Every day is a new lesson learned. The process of inducing criticality is very very complex. Could someone please write an accurate, succinct summary of how plutonium criticality is achieved so I could put it here?

EDIT 3: I would like to sincerely thank everyone for their insight. From everything I'm gathering in the comments (and please feel free to correct me as necessary):  

Tl;dr plutonium is *compressed* into a very compact density by a precise configuration of explosive &quot;lenses&quot; (shaped charges) in a nuke. Once this density is achieved, the mass achieves criticality. The plutonium itself doesn't go critical until it's either been compacted to such a density that its own radiation will energize it to a point of no return, or as with the &quot;dragon's tail&quot; experiment when a core was made critical by reflecting its own radiation back into it, which in turn caused a chain reaction.

For example, if glaucoma takes 10-15 years for blindness in humans, would animals with shorter lifespans be less likely to develop those diseases due to &quot;outliving&quot; them?

Text: I'm reading &quot;the origin of species&quot;, and in ch. 4, under &quot;convergence of character&quot;, Darwin, arguing that a same species would be very unlikely to arise from two different lineages, says, and i quote &quot;if this had occurred, we should meet with the same form, independent of genetic connection&quot;.

But a quick Google search says that Mendel only published his works on inheritance in 1966, 7 years after Darwin's book was published, and DNA was only discovered in 1869. I find it very unlikely that he'd be able to use the term &quot;genetic&quot; in the same sense as us.

So what the hell did Darwin mean by &quot;genetic connection&quot;?!

To sum up, my question here is: do plants have bacteria inside them? Like going across their trunks and the sap or even inside the leaves?

Text: Hi, all.

First of all, apologies if my question is kind of naïve, or even dumb. I'm not that smart of a person, and I just know the basics in most science fields. Just think of me as a 5 year old trying to understand the world around him.

I'm trying to understand the twin paradox, and I've stumbled upon [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-z_zRcLGAk&amp;ab_channel=ScienceEtonnante) (in french, but automatic English translation is quite good), where he explains that the paradox is resolved by the fact that the situations of the two twins are not really symmetrical, despite of what we think, because the traveling twin has to U-turn at some point, and doing so subjects him to an acceleration (at [16:11](https://youtu.be/T-z_zRcLGAk?t=971)). So, in short, it's because he has to accelerate at some point (to U-turn) that their situations are not symmetrical, and that he is indeed the one that age less.

After that, in relativity, there is no more any notion of simultaneity, which is why the traveling twin is not getting younger (or the Earth-one older) suddenly at the exact moment of the U-turn. This part I'm having a lot of trouble grasping, but that's not the point of my question.

So, I have two question about all this:

* Is his explanation &quot;correct&quot;, or at least does it give the right insight about the whole thing? If not, how does this really work?
* If he's right, and the acceleration is the root of the age difference at the end, what would happen in this hypothesis:

&gt; We are in an infinite universe without borders, where if you travel long enough straight forward, you come back to your starting point from the other side. The traveling twin hops in his rocket, take off and travel straight forward until he comes back to Earth (which has magically stayed in the same place and still exists, don't question it too far) from the other side. He has not made any U-turn, so in theory, I guess their situations are still symmetrical.

Which one would have age more, and why?

Text: I understand the basic concept. It takes a long time for light to traverse great distances, which means the furthest objects in the observable universe are also the oldest.

The question is more about how this light is only now reaching us. If the universe expanded slower than the speed of light EM from this time would have passed us already. If it expanded faster, the light would never catch up. I doesn't seem like we should be able to see anything at all.

A search suggests this is possible because of a phenomenon called hyperinflation. The early universe was hot and dense, expanding faster than the speed of light. However, explanations of hyperinflation seem to indicate that it only lasted a few seconds immediately following the big bang, so this would have nothing to do with light from early stars.

Is heat and density the key here? I know it takes about 100,000 years for light created in the core of the sun to reach the surface. Are we talking about light that was trapped and released as the universe expanded and cooled?

Text: Suppose that we had a laser that could release a single photon, and imagine that the photon has a particular &quot;ID number.&quot; 

We use this laser two times to send a photon from point A to point B.  We do this once in empty space and then once through a medium like sugar water, glass, or diamond.

It is my understanding that the light is slowed through the medium because photons are absorbed and then re-emitted repeatedly.  

First question: So my question is, in the case of the diamond, glass, or water does the ***same photon*** that entered at point A exit at point B?  E.g. Would our imaginary ID number be the same?    


I presume it would be for the photon traveling empty space.  


Second question: Are all photons at the same wavelength identical so that it just doesn't make any sense to ask this question or are there some properties that are effectively randomized each time it is re-emitted?

  
Probably a basic question, but I never see discussion of refraction or mediums slowing light down make this clear to me.

Text: I know DRIs can't replace lost dopamine, but if they increase neurotransmission, shouldn't this have some effect on motor symptoms, or at least on response to levodopa?

It seems *intuitively* right and I'm curious why it doesn't play out in reality.

Edit: I just realized MAO-B inhibitors are classified as DRIs sometimes. I'm thinking more about bupropion and methylphenidate.

Text: To my limited understanding of this process, early during embryonic development there is a random inactivation of an X chromosome out of the pair that a female inherits. My question is: Why does this inactivation occur? We also inherit a pair of autosomes so why isn't there inactivation happening to one of them and this is only specific to the X pair, i saw some answers that say &quot;So females dont have double the proteins coded by the X pair&quot; but wouldn't allele dominance solve that? Is it way more complex than that?

My understanding is very elementary so i hope you bear with me, thanks in advance.

Text: Of course we all know that food left in a near-vacuum will dry out and prevent dangerous spoilage from microorganisms. But what if the food was kept moist? If you kept a steak under a thin level of water by some means, would the steak spoil at room temperature in a near-vacuum? If not, what is the *highest* pressure that moist food like a steak could be kept in without spoilage? 

I know that some organisms are able to live in low pressure environments, but would they thrive enough to become toxic?

Text: So... I have two competing mental models of what EM radiation *actually* is from a mechanical perspective. (Turns out a &quot;mechanical perspective&quot; might not be possible which is... distressing.) 

1.  Photons are not EM radiation, but they have EM &quot;fields&quot; around them in the same way that, say, protons and neutrons have &quot;fields&quot; that interact with each other, and those &quot;fields&quot; are where the &quot;waves&quot; come in. These fields are not governed by particles, but are rather some vague *other thing*.  

OR:  

2. Photons *are* EM radiation, and they move in a straight line... but only when we're paying close attention, because wave-particle duality. They are the medium propegating the &quot;waves&quot;.  

I must be wrong either way. Because we can *measure* these waves in terms of length, specifically in nanometers.  

I'm inclined to think that I'm closer to reality with #1 considering that [&quot;reducing all forces to collision&quot; is apparently a lost cause](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance) which my brain is really having trouble accepting as anything but magical thinking.  

If #1 is closer to the correct way of viewing things, you're telling me that this particular spooky action at a distance occurs over great enough distances to be expressed in nanometers? And more importantly, how can we even measure that it occurs in &quot;waves&quot; spanning nanometers?  I know it's describing a &quot;vector field&quot; but doesn't that still require some *thing* that could be detected and measued as having a velocity, and therefore momentum and mass, i.e. a bunch of particles?

And what do photons even *do* in this context? I've seen them described as essentially a side-effect?

**Edit:** I love all the discussion occuring but it's also made me realize that the body of my post mostly goes beyond the question. The question being, we're able to describe the physical wavelength in nanometers of these waves that apparently aren't oscillating in space so much as they oscillate between electric and magnetic fields.  ...how do you assign a unit of length to that?

&gt; MLD is caused by a lack of the enzyme Arylsulfatase-A. Without this enzyme, substances called sulphatides build up, eventually destroying the protective myelin sheath of the nervous system. As a result, the nerves in the brain and the peripheral nerves cease to function properly 

The disorder is called metachromatic leukodystrophy and affects mainly the myelin sheaths that surround nerve cell tracts, due to a build up of sulfatides in the cell's lysosomes (organelles that contain digestive enzyme to degrade various stuff in cells). It stands to reason that with this disorder, every cell in the body lacks the required enzyme to clear them. How is a cure achieved simply by using a lentiviral vector to edit the blood stem cells that live in the marrow? How is that gene edit then 'passed on' to neurons and other cells?

Text: For the record, I am a 1st Year College Student who is taking a Chemistry class. This was a practice question I was extremely curious and wanted to learn more about.

We were practicing fairly basic chemical equations in my Chemistry class when the equation of Fe3O4(s) + H2(g) -&gt; Fe(l) + H2O came up. Fairly simple in terms of chemical balancing, but the actual mechanics of the reaction confused me. I cannot find any explanation of this reaction anywhere I look.

My assumption would be that Iron(II,III) Oxide, when heated to near its melting point, becomes reactive enough to interact with hydrogen gas in the air, stripping it of Oxygen atoms and forming water vapor, thus creating pure Iron which then melts due to having a lower melting point than Iron(II,III) Oxide. However I am unsure and can't find anything to back this claim/assumption.

If anyone more capable in this subject then me could answer my question I would be extremely grateful.

Text: Let's say we've got light entering a cubic piece of glass, at some angle less than 90 degrees.  When it enters, it will be bent at some angle relative to its original path.  When it exits, it will resume traveling at its original direction.  During this time it will also slow down.  (I watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUjt36SD3h8) video explanation as to how this process works.)

Photons have no mass, but they do carry momentum.

During the time the light is inside the glass (let's say it's a very short burst or a very large piece of glass), it's momentum vector is different than when it is traveling in the (for the sake of simplicity) vacuum outside.  I have no idea how its momentum is affected by the speed changes, but certainly it would be affected by the direction change.  And the conservation of momentum says that this momentum should be exchanged with the glass block.

Now obviously the amounts involved would be minuscule and likely undetectable, given any reasonable source of light and piece of glass.  But I'm trying to see if I understand the theory correctly.

Text: From my understanding, there are about 6 major genes that are considered during transplant matching, and at least two of these -  HLA-A and HLA-B both have thousands of variants leading to millions of permutations.

So if we considered all of the major histocompatibility genes and the # of known variants, how many unique immune signatures would we get? If the immune system sort of defines &quot;self&quot;, does this then give us an upper bound of the number of unique &quot;selves&quot;?

Here's a quote from The Song of the Cell talking about the variants:

&gt; Humans have multiple “classical” major histocompatibility genes, and potentially many others, of which at least three, and possibly more, are strongly related to graft compatibility versus rejection. One gene, called HLA-A, has more than a thousand variants, some common and some very rare. You inherit one such variant from your mother and one from your father. A second such gene, HLA-B, also has thousands of variants. You might have guessed already that the number of permutations between just two such highly variable genes is mind-boggling. The chances that you’d share such a barcode with a random stranger you met in a bar are vanishingly small (and all the more reason not to fuse with him or her).”

Cancer came up, of course, and my friend wondered if doctors can tell when a cancer associated with smoking (like lung or mouth/throat) are caused by it, even if a person lies and says they never smoked a cigarette in their life. 

Now I'm curious if that's not only possible for smoking-caused cancers, but other cancers associated with specific things, like chemicals found in war weapons and weed killers.

Text: I have a very basic understanding of how ML algorithms work — you feed them buckets of data, have them look for patterns in the data, and then attempt to generate new data based on those patterns. So I can see how you could give GPT-3 a topic and it could spit out a bunch of words commonly associated with that topic. What I understand less is how it combines those words into original sentences that actually make sense.

I know GPT-3 doesn’t have any sense of what it’s saying — like if I asked it to generate Tweets saying “Elon Musk is dumb”, it doesn’t know who Elon Musk is, what dumb is, or even what “is” is. But somehow it’s able to find information about Elon Musk, and formulate it into a sentence insulting his intelligence.

Can someone who knows more about the inner workings of GPT-3 or language models in general explain the “thought process” they go through when generating these responses?

Edit: I should also add that I understand how basic language models and sentence construction work. What I’m asking about specifically is how does it generate sentences that are relevant to a given topic, especially when there are modifiers on it (eg “write a song about Homer Simpson in the style of The Mountain Goats”)

Text: Imagining a time where one couldn’t simply reference the periodic table, how would scientists have determined that something such as gold, once smelted and purified, was just one element, as opposed to being a compound? 

Water was thought of as classical element and of course we know now that it’s made of hydrogen and oxygen. I can imagine how we might figure that out by either combining the elements that make water or breaking water up into its elements, but how could we have been certain back in the day that substances like gold were elements and not just compounds that are really hard to break apart? Could we really have been completely certain of this before we had the technology to directly observe individual atoms?

This might be a bit more of a history question. Google didn’t give me any satisfactory answers, I don’t think it really understood the question I was trying to ask.

Text: I recently finished The Song of the Cell by Siddhartha Mukherjee, one chapter of which gives a potted history of the field of immunology.  One section pertained to how cells continuously present a random sampling of their internal protein &quot;inventory&quot; to the exterior, bound to an MHC I molecule.  If a passing killer (CD8+) T cell examines this MHC I/peptide complex and determines that the bound peptide is of viral origin, it will kill the infected cell.

Assuming that the presentation of peptides on the cell surface is nonspecific and random, and thus could presumably include normal &quot;native&quot; proteins, how does the killer T cell &quot;know&quot; that a given MHC I-bound antigen is of pathogenic origin, thus triggering the response to kill the infected cell?  Any failure in this discriminatory process could lead to a devastating autoimmune response, I would think, so the cell must be able to tell &quot;self&quot; proteins from &quot;non-self&quot; proteins.  But *how* is this feat accomplished?

I was curious in general what features made a species a good disease vector relative to another species, especially when thinking of non-pest animals, e.g. armadillos with Leprosy, as opposed to animals like fleas that were able to transfer the Bubonic Plague because they were on rats that were near humans.

Text: With recent developments, we've learned that gravity propagates through space at roughly the speed of light.  Do solid celestial objects affect its propagation velocity or &quot;direction&quot;?  If our LIGO system observes a disturbance in a gravitational wave that originated from a distant object on the opposite side of the planet, is there an adjustment that needs to be made to the measurements to compensate for a potential delay, either by the propagation of the wave through the earth, or by it having to &quot;go around&quot; the earth?

What are possible implications of this?  if this is true, can we detect when a dark celestial body has passed between us and a distant known-constant gravity source, due to the refraction or interruption of the gravitational wave

[Elon Musk plans 42,000 Starlink satellites](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-elon-musk-42000-starlink-satellites-earth-effects-stars-2020-10). With an operational lifespan of five years, after which they're de-orbited. We will have an average of 23 (42,000/(365*5)) satellites entering the Earth's atmosphere every day. 

[At 1,250 kg each (for the Starlink 2.0 satellites)](https://www.space.com/spacex-starship-deploy-starlink-satellites-pez-dispenser), that's 29 tons of satellites entering our atmosphere every day, much of that being aluminum. In other words, that will be almost 10,000 tons of aluminum effectively being aerosolized in our upper atmosphere every year.

Have there been any environmental impact studies of this?

Side note: For those who point out that we have two to three times more meteorites (by mass) entering our atmosphere than Starlink satellites, the meteorites are mostly silicates.

Also, unlike [geoengineering techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection) to inject aerosols into our atmosphere to combat global warming, we will have no effective way of shutting off the rain of Starlink satellites. Even if launches are stopped immediately, that's five years worth of satellites coming down. And without a &quot;smoking gun&quot; demonstrating the damages, SpaceX will likely continue launching those satellites to protect their revenue.

Text: So if you take a muon at rest and wait for it to decay, it will turn into a muon neutrino and a W- boson that will become an electron, anti-electron neutrino pair. The total kinetic energy of the three produced particles must be equal to the rest mass of the muon minus the rest mass of the electron. I presume that the neutrino rest masses can be assumed to be negligible.

How is this energy split up between the three particles? Is there an even energy split between the muon neutrino and the W- boson?

My thoughts on this so far are such that the electron can not possibly have more momentum than the other two particles, but due to the colossal difference in mass, I presume that the neutrinos would take at least a reasonable proportion of the energy between them.

How does this all work?

Text: I tried to Google this and did not get any answers specific to this question. From what I understand, you really only need one kidney to survive. That's why live donors/recipients are a thing. Also, if you were born with two healthy kidneys one can pick up the slack of the other if something goes wrong. So will they only know you have a kidney problem when BOTH fail? I assume as long as one is functioning, your tests and blood work would come back normal.

EDIT: To piggyback this logic, why don't we have more 'spares' of other organs. Why is the redundancy factor only built into kidneys?

[The Potential energy graph](https://useruploads.socratic.org/IdqPw0C9QNqts0rgqzCh_ljpot.jpg)

It looked like a Log or Hyperbola graph, plus something like a Parabola at one point. I tried to find a formula for it, but with no success. Everything I find just explains of what the graph means with no formula.

If anyone can just give a keyword, a link, or even the formula, I would appreciate it.

Why do I want to know this? (Don't bother. It's a boring story.)

&gt;!I am trying to make an interactive animation, and need a formula that will bring some dots closer to one another, but stop at some distance. If they get to close to one another, they need to move away from each other. I was wondering about it for a while and then I remembered that graph we learned about in physics class. I looked it up, and I think that is exactly what I need. I know there is probably another better, smarter way to do it, but I though that a single formula would be smoother and less error prone. And what better formula than the one that keeps our world together. Or atleast models the force that does it.!&lt;

Text: The answer of [this](https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/7673/what-causes-adenosine-build-up-in-the-brain-when-awake?) question says the glycogen in brain is eventually depleted over time which causes an atp shortage and abundance of adenosine, which causes sleep; and in sleep the cells can restore their glycogen reserves and break down the built up adenosine to wake up.

Im a bit unsatisfied with this answer. How does brain run out of glycogen? Do neurons use more energy than what can be supplied to them? And how do they produce atp once you wake up if the breaking down of adenosine into inosine is what makes you wake up in the first place?

If anyone has further knowledge on the original question I'd be glad to hear it too.

If it is lost forever , and as the process is going on from millions of years , then the water we have today is only a percent of water which earth had millions or maybe billions of years ago.

This confuses me, because it appears the ride is on fixed axises. When I think of acceleration, I think of a gradual speeding up like a car. Acceleration in this context doesn't seem possible to me since it is contained. Maybe the website is lying, or I'm just dumb. Any help is appreciated.

GPS satellites have to regularly reset their clocks to stay accurate to earth surface time due to the relativistic time difference between the satellite and the earth surface. 

How much younger than its Earth surface age is the ISS due to the fact it’s been spinning around since 1998? Do they have to reset their clocks too?

Yes I know different parts went up at different times some as late as 2011. 1998 was when the first part went up.

Why does perforating the conductor with slits prevent these currents? Wouldn't smaller loops form and still have the same net braking force. 

I'm using this MIT pendulum example to show what I mean. The pendulum with slits doesn't brake. 

Do Eddy currents have a minimum size? If so what determines the size?

The distinction between ionic and metallic bonding is clear enough. 

But what is it about sulfur? Why do certain elements “love” sulfur but not oxide or silicate anions? What characteristic of the sulfide bond makes metal-sulfides behave different from ordinary ionic compounds? 

Does it have to do with sulfide being a larger, “softer” (more polarizable) anion than oxide?

Text: So we hopefully know that people can carry some genetic mutation as a heterozygote and have minimal (or no) symptoms, but potential offspring who are homozygous will then show the associated disease with worse symptoms, this is common. But I wonder if there are examples of genetic diseases where the heterozygous condition is actually more severe than the homozygote? Say if a single mutant allele incorrectly activates some pathway relative to wild type, whereas in the homozygote this creates such a large change that the cell responds and the net effect is minimal? Or if two different protein variants interfere with each others’ function, whereas again this potentially does not occur in the wt or homozygote? This could be a loss of function or gain of function effect on the protein. I am not thinking about sex linked genes, only autosomal, or compound mutants where the other allele is affected by a second variant.

Does this mean the final value  should have an uncertainty of ± 6cm^(3).   


Does this change if I have 5 final values and average them? Does the average still have an uncertainty of ± 6cm^(3)?

Text: I read somewhere that the higher the IQ the more you are likely to be creative and the people with lower IQs do not show the same ability in creativity. Then another source, this one a more recent study, said that IQ and creativity is linked, but at a certain point (around 120 IQ), there stopped being a correlation. I'm curious about this since there are existed highly creative people with high IQs, then there was people who with average and even below average IQs that showed same levels of creativity.

Is there a correlation? Is there a breakpoint at some level and it depends more on other factors?

Text: I was thinking about this after learning surprisingly late that tobacco is a new world plant. I might be wrong here, but the general knowledge I learned was that the lack of indigenous American tolerance of alcohol was related to an enzyme they didn't have because they did not have alcohol in their culture the way Europe did. Also that east Asian people are more likely to be lactose intolerant because of the relative lack of milk and cheese in their traditional diets.

Has anyone ever collected data on tobacco related illnesses in indigenous Americans? Sure, there are a ton of modern toxic substances in cigarettes now, but I wonder if they have a higher resistance to things like lung cancer caused by smoking?

It doesn't seem to work that way though in my family or in many others so it makes me wonder. Sexuality is complex though.

Text: As I understand it (with my PhD in astronomy, but not in cosmology specifically), cosmic expansion means that space-time itself is expanding. I get the whole &quot;inflating balloon&quot; analogy. OK.

I read things about how if the universe has &gt; critical density then it will collapse (again). Or even if it's subcritical, then it should at least be slowing down in its expansion (were it not for dark energy driving faster expansion, that is).

The explanation I typically see for an expected slowing of the expansion is that gravity is an attractive force — it should pull stuff back together. Most explanations I read tend to end there.

But **why** would you expect gravity to arrest the expansion of the universe in the first place? The expansion is **not** a conventional explosion away from a center. It's **not the case** that other galaxies are flying away with some kinetic energy that is being transformed in to gravitational potential energy. Rather, expansion is an isotropic inflation, where everything gets further away from everything else as space-time expands.

If a particular galaxy were to get pulled by gravity in a way that would cause the universe to &quot;slow down&quot; its expansion, then would direction would that be? There is no center of the universe. The gravitational forces acting on any galaxy should be (on average) isotropic (but for some clusters and large-scale structure, but I don't think that's relevant to this question).

**TL;DR** — The statement &quot;gravity \[should\] slow the universe's expansion&quot; appears fallacious to me, and yet I see it everywhere\*. **What I am misunderstanding?**

\* by everywhere I mean, e.g., [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2021/01/05/how-is-the-universe-accelerating-if-the-expansion-rate-is-dropping/?sh=385dbe044093), [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/expanding-universe-slows-then-speeds/), [Harvard](https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/supernova/newdata/fate.html), many others.

Like let's say you have a pedigree dog like your run of the mill golden retriever.  They all look extremely similar.  Let's say a litter of puppies all go to homes and they grow up and then 4 years later run into each other like in a dog park or something.  Would the dogs recognize each other as family?  Like would they know that's their mom or dad or sibling?
Like do the animals have some kinda scent they give off to know that this is my litter mate... Whereas they could run across another golden retriever completely unrelated and know that it's not their family?  Or let's say the other dog had the same parent dogs but not of the same litter, can they recognize the connection at least that they have the same parents?

Text: On the most recent episode of [Volts](https://open.substack.com/pub/davidroberts/p/taking-carbon-out-of-the-air-and), they discussed CO2 sequestration in concrete. The claim is that injecting CO2 into the cement/concrete mixing process increases its compressive strength. According to this literature review from [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21148-w), &quot;CO2 curing can decrease the compressive strength of CCU concrete when compared to conventional concrete.&quot; 

If CO2 injection strengthens concrete, then it might be a real candidate for long term carbon sequestration. The incentives align. If it doesn't, it will be difficult to get concrete manufacturers on board at scale.

The orbit seems to be much more elliptical than Earths orbit, which is quite circular and doesnt play any role in weather or tempereture, because the distance from the sun doesnt vary that much.

But mercurys distance varies much more.

I mean, surely it could have an affect right?

If you can find a graph related to this, it would be awesome, but any calculations or things like that are fine too. I just don't know where to start, and google doesnt help either.

Text: Currently looking at a fire scar data set for trees throughout North America. The data set includes fire scars identified back to around 257 CE. The data set also includes the final growth year (e.g. 1810). I could understand how the dating occurred if there was recorded dates when the trees were cut down, but a lot of the data came from dead trees with no record of their final growth year. 

What are some ways trees could be dated without knowing the final growth year?

The way I read that 100% heritable corresponds phenotype dependent 100% on genes. But! this still doesn’t tell us probability of trait given parent has trait. I.e. it measures correlation between genes and trait but not correlation between parents phenotype and a trait? 

Is this the correct interpretation? If so is there a statistics that describes probability of phenotype given parents phenotype (outside pundit square case)?

When the baby was born she was given a clean bill of health physically. No abnormalities. If anyone is concerned, the baby is currently in foster care since my sister is not currently fit to parent. 

My concern is with the brain. Her body seems okay, but how likely is it she could face mental issues? 

And if certain mental disorders already run in the family (adhd, addiction, bipolar, learning disabilities) how likely is it that drug use during development has increased the likelihood? Or could drugs have increased the possible severity?

Also, could there be abnormalities in the body that weren’t detected? Like could an organ have developed wrong and we won’t know until she’s older?

Text: When we were learning about the equilibrium constant, someone mentioned that it could just arbitrarily be changed by changing the values of the balanced equation. As an example, the equilibrium constant expression for the Haber process would be 

(([NH3]^(2))/([H2]^(3) x ([N2]) 

And assuming the concentration of ammonia is 1, hydrogen is 2, and nitrogen is 2, the equilibrium constant becomes 0.062. 

But since it’s just a stoichiometric relationship, the balanced equation 

2N2 + 6H2 —&gt; 4NH3 

Is valid too. So therefore, the equilibrium constant expression could also be written as 

(([NH3]^(4))/([H2]^(6) x ([N2]^2)

Assuming the same concentration values as before, this would give us a value of 0.003. 

So what is the point of having this equilibrium constant expression if it can just be arbitrarily changed, even though the ratio of moles for each molecule is the same? Do we always need to reduce to the lowest ratio, or is any ratio fine? Which ratio is “acceptable” or “best practice?” Our teacher made none of this clear—even after asking him, so I’m still quite confused.

Text: Just thought about it so my thoughts are a bit confused. 

I know time depends on gravity force as time-space is a field. When you are next to a heavy body time is faster. 
When we calculated the age of the universe we used thermodynamic equations that ruled how it will expands and reversed them to find a single point, but that only applies to calculations and observations made on earth right? 
So is our universe 13.7 billion years old only for a constant earth gravity? Would it be anither result somewhere else in the universe? Could it be shorter as in the beginning of expansion everything was very dense and thus happened faster?

- Or do we completely lose temperature variants between seasons, and it just stays cold all the time? 

2. What was going on in central and South America? Or Africa? Was it just business as usual for life down there? The regular flow of seasons and such, unaffected by the ice sheets?

T Cells are a crucial part of immunity right? They can differentiate into memory cells.

In the book, it says that a T Cell's lifespan is 20-30 years so basically a 20-30 year old man can still have the same T Cells and antibodies from the immune response of the mandatory vaccine they took when they were babies. And it also explains why we sometimes need to re-vaccinate for some diseases like Tetanus and Rabies and recently COVID 19.

Can we use paleoclimate to presume that Neanderthals were working mammoth leather into boots to travel in the snow 120,000 years ago, perhaps 400,000 years? There is a flute from 60,000 years ago, and it's more useful and easy to craft a shoe than a flute.

Can we suggest that Neanderthals excursions north are evidence of human's first technological ability to live in the cold with clothes, and homo-habilis too because his flint tooling was as technical as clothesmaking?

Is the progressively northward range of humans evidence for boot technology?

Text: Based on my extremely limited understanding, the blue-eyes mutation in human beings can be traced back to an  isolated origin in the Western Hunter-Gatherer (WHG) ancestry pool, around 10,000 years ago at the turn of the Mesolithic period.

With the arrival of the Yamnaya culture, the first Proto Indo-European speakers arrived in Europe due to a western migration. As a result of this migration and the melting ice age, a good chunk of the WHG tribes moved north into the Scandanavian glaciers, hence the prevelance of blue eyes amongst Scandinavian peoples.

My question is, how did the blue-eyes mutation then spread to places such as the Indian subcontinent? It would make sense if the blue-eyes trait was of Caucasian origin, as these people also moved east into India and the Middle East.

Am I missing something here?

Edit: I said chemical reaction because, in my understanding (which is very limited and probably wrong), a chemical reaction has an input and an output (it's probably like Plutonium+neutron-&gt; ??+energy+neutron(s))

_Edit2: I will not build an atom bomb, I would've just looked up a tutorial on youtube if that was the problem._

Text: Hi everyone !

Basically, I am worldbuilding for a future Tabletop RPG, and I need some informations.

I want to know how much influence does a natural satellite have on the formation of planets, its continents, its landmasses, and all about geography and climate (maybe geology ?). Also, what would happen if a natural satellite suddenly appears around a planet that did not had one ?

This might be a lot of information for one simple answer, so feel free to point me towards article or other papers that can explain it for a non-scientist like me.

Also, maybe you can give me a precise answer based on the context of my world. To be simple, there was Pangea, magic stuff happened, big war against Creator of the Universe, he/she/it decides to punish enemies by throwing them and their city in space, creating a new Mars-like (like red desert planet) satellite directly from the crust of the original Earth-like planet they lived on. This whole process is such a cataclysm that it destroys Pangea and reshapes the lands.
I need some kind of clues to know how I can reshape this world and how this new satellite influence this.

Thanks !

The story is set in a cliffside village (much like Mesa Verde), but I know that crows create their habitats in mostly urban environments, hence the following questions:

* How large would a city need to be for crows to take roost?
* The village in-question is cut into the side of a grand canyon-esque cliff and surrounded by 180 degrees of forest at its base; does there need to be an urban city on the cliff's edge above this village in order to attract crows in the first place, or will they roost in any place where humans gather and build structures?

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for 'X' were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;.

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field.

I know that plenty of animals have some kind of capacity for language, but do any of them have *grammar* of any recognizable form. Whales, dolphins, elephants, gorillas, and so on. Have we been able to identify subjects, objects, predicates, or any parts of speech?

Text: I was just watching [this Vox video](https://youtu.be/LAkFtka3UFw) about why more people need glasses today (that turned out to be more on how to prevent and treat myopia than analysing the causes) and made me wonder. The video goes back to 1971 and I find hard to believe that as many people then would have access to optometry and glasses and the threshold to go to the doctor would generally be higher.

Similarly, particularly in the case of my country, I often hear about the general rise of diabetes, and at the same time, I remember being a kid and even until like 15 ~ 20 years ago doctors complaining, very publicly that diabetes was not a disease that was given the worries necessary and the diagnostic was very lacking to the point of many people discovering the disease only when they had terrible consequences. Today I practically never see a diabetic foot amputee or a fully blind diabetic. So my thought is: &quot;even if diabetes rates have increased in the country how do they know if statistics were so much unexistent?&quot;

This all leads me to my broader question, in the title, that is, do these growth analysis generally take in consideration increase in knowledge about the population. I take the opportunity to go further and ask, if so, how exactly is it done and how accurate are they?

The studies I have read use face to face competitions in their experiments, I’m wondering if there’s any evidence of the winners effect in non face to face competitions. For example, will winning an online chess game or video against someone who I don’t know at all increase my testosterone? My hypothesis is that it won’t as my mind doesn’t really know if I’m actually playing against another person, which means my mind doesn’t think that my position on the social dominance hierarchy is changing.

Let's say you now boost your immune system by healthy habits like exercising, cold showers, healthy food and whatnot. Is it possible for the immune system to fully eradicate a chronic infection because it is now 'capable' somehow of doing things that it previously couldn't? Maybe it detects the dormant guys when before it couldn't? Kinda like how a person with AIDS will catch infections easily, but in reverse.  

**EDIT**: So I feel like many people are misinterpreting a 'boosted' or 'stronger' immune system as one that recklessly attacks everything. That's not what I meant. Stronger refers to 'an increased ability to detect what is and what is not part of the body'. Chronic infections are allowed to exist because the body doesn't recognize that the infection is not supposed to be there. Making the system stronger is meant as saying, making the system being able to recognize these pathogens better, so they can be removed.

Text: This arose when my daughter noticed a natural gas smell in the hallway outside her room. I didn’t smell it, but then she said she only noticed it when she leaves her room. More smelling and going in and out of rooms and outside confirms - it smells like the additive to gas, but only when leaving her room after staying for more than a few seconds. It’s probably ultimately the litter box in the hall (which is kept clean and mostly doesn’t stink) but again the hall only smells like gas when leaving her room. It made us think of how our eyes seem to white-balance, and so we see an opposite color when strongly exposed. For instance if you spend a lot of time in a greensceen stage, the entire world looks magenta for a few minutes.

Text: Iron-54 is a naturally occurring stable isotope of iron, consisting of 5.845% of natural iron found on earth, according to the isotope table found here https://applets.kcvs.ca/IPTEI/IPTEI.html

If one were to separate a mostly pure amount of Fe-54, how would its physical properties differ from the more common Iron-56, which composes 91.754% of natural iron? There is certainly some Iron-54 among normal pieces of iron, but only about 5.8%. For example, if you were to make a sword out of nearly 100% Iron-54, how would it differ from one made out of normal iron? Would it heat treat and temper differently? Would it be ever so slightly more lightweight than normal iron, due to it not having as many neutrons in its nucleus? Would it be more or less resistant to rusting?

Text: When I see a video like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KrCmBNiJRI) of a white blood cell chasing a bacterium that is evading capture, I make an assumption that both of these organisms are \*behaving\* by which I mean they are doing something beyond simply reacting to the chemestry or physics of their environment. 

To clarify: A dead leaf skitters across the ground when the wind blows, but that is not behavior, just a reaction of a physical body to the force of the wind. Are the white blood cell and the bacterium doing more than that? Is there some internal operation that adds something to their response to their chemical and physical environment? 

To clarify further: Humans percieve their environment and then react in complex ways to it that are determined by a central nervous system. The single-celled organisms don't have such a system (right?), but do they have something more than a dead leaf has, which helps to determine their response to their environment?

What, if anything, drives the &quot;behavior&quot; of these organisms? What do we call it? And how does it work?

2. The first ball hits the second ball, the second the third…(often explained with billard balls) If multiple balls are lifted at the start, it works the same, but two times directly after each other
3. At the point of collision, two Shockwaves start to travel in both directions, reflect of the respective end of the cradle, and the cradle sepperates at the point they meet again.

Text: Hello! I'm conducting a research regarding glycoalkaloids for their therapeutic use. To get these glycoalkaloids extracted, I have to dry them up however, I had the option to do air drying but the time to do that is not already feasible so I decided to try oven drying. I was wondering if oven-drying might potentially damage the significant amount of glycoalkaloid present in the plant sample or it bares no difference from a fresh sample. All I know so far oven-drying can at least prevent the sample from getting rotten due to moisture content though, not so much about whether it does reduce the phytochemicals when placed it under oven-drying. 

Also, if oven-drying does seem helpful. Is it a general rule to have it done in just days, coz I'm curious of having in a week but that might give erroneous result if I overdo it (not risking coz I'm being tight in time and budget for undergrad.)

Text: I was watching a documentary about the cultivation of vines in Europe for the manufacture of wine.  In that documentary they mention that there was an insect that attacked European vines because the trees had thinner bark.  However, the plague did not attack American vines because they had the thickest bark.

 From this discovery, they began to cultivate American vines and they put grafts of European vines on them, so they would have a thick skin and they would give European grapes (since the American grapes from this vineyard were not very pleasant to the taste).

 From here my question arises, do plants have defense mechanisms against other plants that may try to take advantage of their nutrients, cells and structures?  Or can they detect when a plant is dominating gene expression to make the bark thicker?  Something like a function similar to what the Major Histocompatibility Complex would do in humans, which detects foreign cells and those not typical of our body, rejecting these grafts.

Colonial animals are made up of  &quot;zooids&quot;. A zooid is a multicellular, individual organism but each zooid has a specialized function and could not survive were it to be separated from the colony. 

Isn't that exactly what an organ is? An organ is a multicellular, self-contained entity within an animal. An organ performs a specialized function within the body. An organ could not survive were it to be separated from the main body. 

So what distinguishes the two? Is it because colonial organism don't have brains so their organs are said to act independently?

Text: I was walking this morning through a light Aussie scrub forest. I was at the bottom of a valley, 30* angles on the sides. Most of the time the air was cool and smelled like forest, but twice a warm, human-smelling bubble would pass over slowly, seemingly in a 5m area. Both times I looked around and there was definitely nothing nearby causing this, and I was about 3km from the nearest road or house.
The “human” smell was like the inside of an older car, vaguely like cigarette smoke that has been melded in to the fabric.

Text: Or perhaps as another vent of Katmai, whose magma chamber drained when Novarupta erupted, causing a caldera summit collapse at Katmai.

Basically, I'm wondering how geologists determine that a volcano is separate from another, but especially in this case. I can see how nearby volcanoes can have different magma chambers, making them distinct volcanoes. But Novarupta seems far too close to Trident, and too obviously interlinked with Katmai, to qualify.

So what's the deal there?

There is a lot of literature out there studying what effect the size of a family has on a ton of different outcomes. But most of it seems to be about exploring differences between small families and large families. 

Has anyone ever looked in to whether odd numbered families have it better than even numbered families?

Text:  

So I am very familiar with the concept of mirror neurons and all of the debate surrounding them. I need some help understanding what they actually mean? I have done some research and asked professors and can't get a clear answer.

I know the idea is that mirror neurons are supposedly neurons that fire when you observe AND do an action (neurons that are activated when you reach for something are also activated when you see someone else reach). 

I really do not think that mirror neurons “cause” imitation, but I am confused on something. If someone is watching a video of an actor reaching for targets and has to tap a key corresponding to where the actor reaches, what would the expected results be? My question is, if an actor reaches to a target on THEIR right (OBSERVER’S left) and the observer has a shorter reaction time to respond to the same target (by hitting a left key) than opposite (hitting the right key), could mirror neurons be a possible explanation? Or not, because mirror neurons would imply that observer’s would be faster to hit the THEIR right (exactly imitating the action of the person on screen?). 

I guess my question is just if the “imitation” in mirror neurons refer to things from the observer’s point of view, or the actor’s. In simpler terms, would mirror neuron theories mean that an observer would be more inclined to match the direction of someone (mirroring them…Actor-Left-Arm Movement would lead to Observer-Right-Arm-Movement) or the action of someone (Actor-Left-Arm-Movement would lead to Observer-Left-Arm-Movement). So sorry for the complicated and confusing and unclear post! TIA!

Text: Hope its ok to post this here - was looking for input from those who understand the science of drugs, as I am trying to establish if one of my ADHD medications (prescribed) is prohibited from being brought into Japan (quite hard to get up to date accurate info).

\*\*Just to be clear, I am NOT going to use any info I am given here to determine if I can bring it with me, I am continuing to research this, trying to get in contact with relevant authorities etc, and unless I have confirmation from said authorities I will not bring it. This post is just to help set my expectations in the meantime!\*\*

The medication in question is **dexamphetamine** (brand name Amfexa) which I take in the afternoons.

I know that Adderall is not allowed under any circumstances - and this contains **amphetamine** and **dextroamphetamine.**

**Lisdexamphetamine** on the other hand, *is* allowed, as long as you get a special permit (This is what I take in the mornings).

You can see the full list of controlled substances and their categories [here](https://www.ncd.mhlw.go.jp/dl_data/keitai/list.pdf) \- Amphetamine is listed as a &quot;stimulant&quot; and strictly prohibited, lisdexamphetamine is listed as &quot;stimulant raw materials&quot; and as I say allowed with a permit. They don't actually specify dextroamphetamine or dexamphetamine anywhere.

When I search dexamphetamine, many of the search results come back with dextroamphetamine and it often doesn't seem to differentiate between them, some people also call Amfexa the &quot;UK Adderall&quot; as they are very similar (although Adderall is not licensesd here in the UK either)

So I was just wondering, is there a fundamental difference in them, in the same way that there is with lisdexamphetamine (which as I say is permitted). I know lisdexa is slow release, and dexa is instant, and the ban is presumably to do with preventing abuse. But I thought this was the reason Adderall isn't licensed in the UK, whereas dexa is commonly prescribed by psychiatrists.

Thanks in advance!

So my question is if a woman took the pill continually such that she doesn't have a period would that cause her also not to release eggs and in doing so cause her eggs to last  longer and thus menopause to be delayed by the number of years she was continually on the pill. 

If so could a woman perhaps do so for 10 to 15 years resulting in menopause occurring in her 60 to mid 60s rather than 50s when she is still working.

Text: I remember my teacher explaining that greenhouses keep the environment inside them warm because glass lets most visible light in but no infrared out, making new heat, and that's also what CO2 and lots of other gasses do, hence the greenhouse effect we all know and love.

However, some people say that this theory is outdated and infrared has nothing to do with it, but instead greenhouses work by limiting air exchange, so if you keep the same air in the same sun-exposed enclosure for a long time it's going to get warmer simply because it can't mix with outside air. So no new heat is made, it's just trapped in place, and therefore the term &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; as applied to the earth's atmosphere is a misnomer.

So who's right?

Text: I often hear that probiotics can help with urinary tract infections and the vaginal microbiome. I also recently heard that they can help with/protect you from respiratory infections like COVID-19.

I am having a hard time imagining how this works. Am I missing something? Are these articles referring to oral gut probiotics (like yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, probiotic pills, etc.)? Or are they referring to a completely different kind of probiotics applied directly to the site? How could gut bacteria have an impact on the urinary tract, skin, vagina, lungs, etc? Do the gut bacteria stay in the gut or can they migrate to parts of the body (like the skin or urinary tract)? And do they have some kind of effect while in the gut that can somehow impact areas far away (like the respiratory system)? How does this work?

I am aware of the gut-brain connection claims, which make more sense to me, but some of these other claims seem strange to me.

Text: So for them to combine into one object they'll have to be perfectly inelastic, so that's the assumption.

Logically, they would hit eachother then perfectly stop, because no other outcome makes sense.

However, doing the math for sum of work on 2 balls with 1 kg and 1 m/s each:

W1=0.5\*m\_1\*v\_1\^2=0.5\*1\*1\^2=0.5

W2=0.5\*m\_2\*v\_2\^2=0.5\*1\*1\^2=0.5

Wnet=0.5+0.5=1=1/2\*m\_net\*v\_net\^2=1/2\*2\*v\_net\^2

v\_net=0.707.

&amp;#x200B;

How is this possible? How can they have a velocity? Which direction would it be going? Logically, they would stop in place.

Is it therefore the case that this equation does not work in this situation? Is it because this equation ignores loss to heat and sound etc. and normally that loss is somewhat negligible? I'm a little confused.

Doesn’t this seemingly break the law of COE, since it appears to have an ever increasing amount of energy with which it expands?

Text: Has the HIV virus become weaker or less deadly? To clarify, I’m referring to the virus, itself, not the results of advances in treatment and management of HIV and AIDS.

During the height of the AIDS pandemic in the 1980s people would seemingly go from from healthy to HIV+ to AIDS to dead in a matter of years. Today you rarely hear of AIDS-related deaths. Certainly not to the same extent as the 80s and early 90s. 

On the flip side, I know other parts of the world are still struggling with massive HIV outbreaks. Parts of Africa, for one. How do the death rates there compare to the outbreak in the 80s?

It seems that pandemics often have a sort of bell curve where the most deadly strains of a virus eventually lose out to milder strains that don’t usually kill their host which makes it easier to pass onto others. Has that happened with HIV?

Plasma seems intuitive because you are stripping pieces of the atom away, but what about the three basic phases?

Text: Tantalum-180m1 is the only primordial nuclear isomer, and is observationally stable, unlike its ground state which has a half life of about 8 hours.

According to Wikipedia, it has sufficient energy to decay in three ways: isomeric transition to the ground state of 180Ta, beta decay to 180W, and electron capture to 180Hf. However, no radioactivity from any decay mode of this nuclear isomer has ever been observed. Only a lower limit on its half-life of over 1015 years has been set, by observation. The very slow decay of 180mTa is attributed to its high spin (9 units) and the low spin of lower-lying states. Gamma or beta decay would require many units of angular momentum to be removed in a single step, so that the process would be very slow.

Compared to common Tantalum-181 which composes 99.98799% of natural Tantalum, 180mTa has a natural occurrence of 0.01201%.

It is thought to be created via photodisintegration of common Tantalum-181 causing neutron emission, so hypothetically more could be made by bombarding 181Ta with gamma rays. 

The closest thing to having a significant amount of 180mTa in one place right now would probably be in the Majorana Demonstrator, where 17.4 kilograms of pure Tantalum, including about 2.088 grams of 180mTa, are being observed in an effort to try to find the elusive decay of the isotope.

If 180mTa were extracted by isotope separation from 181Ta, would its metastability change anything about its properties? Unlike other nuclear isomers, appreciable amounts of it would be able to be created, separated, and gathered in one place without having to worry about it decaying into something else. Would its excitation energy cause anything bizarre, like increase its elasticity, or possess superconductivity?

Text: Edit: since that stupid show &quot;Ancient Apocalypse&quot; is getting a bunch of attention at the moment, let me be clear the following has NOTHING to do with that. I do not believe there's some advanced lost civilisation, I do not believe in atlantians, I do not believe these sea people came and gave this technology to these people. I just don't understand how ~12k years ago we go from extremely simple building engineering, to Karaahan Tepe. The advancement to Göbekli Tepe a few k years later though makes total sense, you can see the gradual improvements they made from KT to GT, it's linear progress.  But KT appears to suddenly jump into existence, during the younger dryas at that. It just feels to me either I'm missing something deep, or perhaps there could be a chain of similar sites going back 15k, 20k, 30k, etc years (but even then I ask why did it take between ~250k years or ~40k years to figure out the early ones?).

Karahan Tepe, the older sister site of the world famous Göbekli Tepe, appears to be around 12,000 years old.

All of the evidence we have found so far suggests they were hunter gatherers who may have been doing small amounts of agriculture (which is backed up by genetic tracing of our modification of species, which happened over thousands of years). And on top of that did not have pottery.

Of course I've heard that this may imply that it may not have been agriculture that allowed us the time and requirements to build structures like this, but structures like this that allowed us to start agriculture. Or (what I would lean to) is that it was a slow mix of each pushing each other along.

But what I don't understand, is if humans were capable of this back then with essentially pre/minimal-agriculture, then why don't we see any further back?

Why weren't we building these structures 15,000 years ago. Or 30,000? Or 50,000? Or even 100,000?

I understand about the ice age (although some of the PPN sites seemed like they may have developed in the younger dryas, which makes even less sense?). But there were still warmer climates with humans in them.

Why did it take us ~250k years to suddenly figure this out, and then when we do figure it out, we're suddenly pretty damn good at it? Or even if you follow that humans only became behaviourally modem 70k years ago, again why did it take 60k years?

It just doesn't make much sense to me. Humans who could figure out how to make stone weapons, fire, primitive homes, etc, surely absolutely understood that you could chip away and grind away stone.

Is it possible we just haven't found these yet? And that there's just fewer due to lower population? It feels obvious to me that there must be some missing as there's such a jump to the PPN ones.

Or is there a reason humans couldn't/didn't build sites like this. And something suddenly changed?

That's quite hot, and most people don't have the ability to cook above those temperatures, sure. What happens if you did cook mushrooms hot enough to break down the chitin, though?

I did some googling, didn't see anything, but feel free to link any articles that do answer the question.  


Edit: The summary so far is that they would almost certainly burn if done in the presence of oxygen, and pressure cooking would take ridiculous amounts of pressure. Sounds like wrapping some in steel foil and putting them in a pizza oven could work?

I'm an undergraduate bio taking organic chemistry and we recently covered Markovnikovs, after the lesson I went on to read a bit about Mr Markovnikov and learned he was alive long before the invention of many of the important equipment used in modern chemical analysis.

I asked my professor how a man alive during the mid 1800s to early 1900s was able to actually &quot;do&quot; this without the use of advanced technology we have today. She said she wasn't actually sure but that his Rule (until boron enters the equation of course) is a fundamental aspect of chemical reactions regardless.

Is it a situation similar to Gregor Mendel doing his pea study and accidentally stumbling onto a (in terms of Mendellian genetics) correct conclusion?

Text: I believe there is a quality benefit in that I'm told that cooking many foods makes them easier to digest (how much easier?) and I'm aware that it is safer, meat in particular, to subject foods to enough heat to kill harmful bacteria. 

What I'm interested in is whether there is a nutritional benefit. It seems plausible that cooking could actually harm nutrients, but is there a nutritional benefit that makes up for this?

Follow-up if nutrtion profile does not change: If I have the nutritional data for a food by weight, and I cook the food, it will have less weight. Will the resulting food have the same nutrition as the uncooked food I start with (is the weight loss only water?)

I started thinking about this while being pitched a raw food diet for my dog. The premise doesn't make sense to me for the same reason that dog owners who feed their dogs raw meet likely aren't eating raw meat themselves, but the claim is that it has a health benefit for the dog and I have no knowledge of that but am thinking that if it does, surely it would apply to humans as well.

Apologies if I have the wrong flair or have asked in the wrong forum. Seems like a biology question fundamentally.

For example: I have read that Cheetahs, Lions, leopards originated in Africa 3-4 million years ago, and after migrating to Asia, tigers evolved from leopards and only continued to migrate northeast and north west and never went to Africa. 

However, elsewhere I have read that tigers evolved first slightly over 2 million years ago from snow leopards, and lions and cheetahs did not evolve until after that in Africa, eventually having lions come to Asia. 

There are even more conflicting theories with dates differing in the millions, does anybody have a source that can answer this question with more accurate and research information? 

TLDR; What continent and time period did big cats originate, who came first to earth, tiger or Lion?

Text: So I'm aware that, most notably, humans and cows suffer quite a debilitating condition if they partake in cannibalism, as Kuru and mad cow disease from prion infection.

But, I do see many other animals ranging from mammals, birds, and arthropods engage in cannibalism, even eating their own offspring. Are they also exposed to risks like prion diseases?

And, what exactly is the &quot;norm&quot;?  Is it more common to not be affected?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thank you all for the responses. I believe I misspoke when I brought up Kuru and MCD, as I was just trying to find a more... tangible disease than just &quot;the jitters&quot; that I'm familiar with. Most of the videos I've watched on the subject seemed to imply that cannibalism in any capacity will eventually cause some sort of extremely debilitating disease/condition, and was not aware how specific those two examples actually were.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, I am still quite confused on the actual chain of events when cannibalism occurs (without prior infection like Kuru and MCD), for species that are affected negatively.

Text: Dielectric breakdown is an issue but there are materials (diamond, Teflon, ultra-high vacuum) that only break down at absurdly high voltages.

If you want the most bang for your buck (both volume and mass wise) why not step up the voltage a capacitor charges at super duper high? Then the energy of the capacitor is proportional to the volume * permittivity * dielectric strength ^2. Why not have a centimeter of diamond between two plates with a potential difference of a million or so volts? That’s good energy density right there. According to my calculations, diamond capacitors should have somewhere around a hundredth the volumetric energy density of gasoline, which really isn’t *that* bad for certain applications

Text: Particle entanglement is often described as spooky action at a distance.  Where two particles interact regardless of the physical distance between them.  Entanglement has also been described as a measurement of one particle that decides the properties of another because the interaction between them determines their shared properties that must be conserved.  However, can the entanglement include more particles, can this be expanded to a macroscopic level to observe things like additional dimensions or new physics?

Text: I ask because I know that most extant birds (either flying or flightless) are omnivores.

I also know that the only two extant birds species that are obligate herbivores are the unique hoatzin and the strange kakapo, one is a poor flyer, the other is really flightless, but a great climber.

Formerly, there were nonmarine carnivorous flightless birds such as phorusrhacids (or terror birds, if you want), and the mysterious Jamaican caracara (these two examples are both australavians like the kakapo, but the former is related to seriamas, and the latter was technically the world's only flightless species from the order Falconiformes). Since they are all dead, the only living carnivorous birds are the famous penguins, and the critically endangered flightless cormorant. Both penguins and cormorants are marine obligate carnivores.

However, I think there still could be an extant nonmarine carnivorous flightless bird: the kagu (this species is exclusively found in New-Caledonia, which is part of the Fifth French Republic).

As long as I can remember I’ve just had this weird thing with some shades of blue where it just blurs everything around it. I never really thought much of it or even that I could be colorblind until recently. I know for sure that I am pretty severely night blind and so is my mother and I’m wondering if the two (night blindness and tritanomaly) are correlated or if it’s just a coincidence and they aren’t related at all. I’m also curious because to my knowledge my dad isn’t color blind (my born sex is female) and can see perfectly fine at night time as well.

Text: What I mean is I have a hypothesis.

Euarchontoglires were apparently originally obligate omnivores: that explain why some of them are great scavengers, and why they can tolerate MUCH MORE ethanol, caffeine and theobromine than almost all other animals. To be exact, all apes (such as gibbons and humans), rabbits, squirrels, murids (such as brownn rats and house mice), cricetids (such as hamsters), and caviids (such as Guinea pigs and capybaras) can all drink coffee, and eat chocolate, for many other animals, they are very toxic (just ask birds, squamates, felines, canids, and even equids). Euarchontoglires that are omnivores with carnivorous tendancies include mandrills, baboons, aye-ayes, and water rats. Euarchontoglires that are omnivores with herbivorous tendencies include gorillas, lemurs, and squirrels. Euarchontoglires that really are obligate omnivores include anatomically modern humans, chimpanzees (both common chimpanzees and bonobos formerly known as pygmy chimpanzees), pen-tailed treeshrews, hamsters, brown rats, and house mice. The only Euarchontoglires that are obligate carnivores I know are tarsiers, and the only Euarchontoglires I know that are obligate herbivores I know are caviids, beavers, and mole-rats.

Also, most Euarchontoglires are small: the world's largest extant Euarchontoglires species is either the anatomically modern human (*Homo sapiens*) (if we are talking about both height, and legspan), or the eastern gorilla (*Gorilla beringei*) (if we are talking about mass, volume, and armspan), or the tetraploid rodent (I forgot its scientific name, sorry) (if we are talking about genome size). If we include extinct species, there was a South American rodent that weighed 1,000 kilograms, or even more, and maybe *Gigantopithecus blacki* was 2.4-3.6 metres tall with a mass of 350-1,000 kilograms.

Finally, Euarchontoglires tend to be gregarious (such as rabbits, beavers, and gibbons), or alternatively prosocial (such as capybaras, brown rats, house mice, lemurs, gorillas, and chimpanzees), or even eusocial (such as mole-rats, and, in a sense, humans). Among the exceptions, there are orangutans (which are solitary in an on and off manner), and hamsters (which are obligate solitary). However, some Euarchontoglires are pacifists (such as bonobos, gorillas, orangutans, capybaras, and Guinea pigs), other are warriors (such as brown rats, house mice, baboons, mandrills, common chimpanzees, and humans) (I sometimes say that, in comparison to humans, orangutans are autistic empaths, and hamsters are schizophrenic sociopaths).

Do you agree with me? Why or why not? Thanks.

Text: Hi,  


So a little background. I have been working as a product manager in the ML space for a while. I enjoy the new technology and I think the new advancements done in LLM is really impressive. I know a little bit about the space, but the space is huge and I, of course, have been trying to understand things that is related to my work.  


However, I feel like we are jumping to some extreme conclusions when are talking about this subject. I hear in podcasts and on linkedin that with the recent improvements we can get better performance with algorithmic generated training data, and I've seen a few papers linked. I guess it looks legit, but I have not seen anyone smart explain what that means, to a non technical person like myself. People are very eager to take that truth and jump to the next conclusion built on top of this; &quot;with self improving algorithms we will be able to bla bla bla bla&quot;. 

So, if I understand things correctly, we need to tell the model what is good knowledge (training data), and we need to give one (or more) goal function(s) to optimize for (?). In the Sam Altman (OpenAI CEO) interview by Lex Fridman, Sam clearly states that they put a lot of effort into the pre-training data set (and is very non-talkative about the composition of the data, which I guess is probably one of the main company secrets). This is the knowledge that is put in to the model, this is where we tell it what is true (and potentially what is not true). We give it a, or a few, metrics to optimize for, and it finds the correct tuning on the parameters over the epochs of training. In ChatGPT's case it is also adding a human into the loop, to fine tune the model by giving two options and letting the human select the best version, also stated in the interview. 

If we conclude that we can generate better algorithmic output with algorithmically generated training data, what does that mean? To me it sounds like we can squeeze a little more performance of the model, not that we can feed the models infinitely, with better and better training data that it has produced. What is that data, even? What happened to the truths we fed the model?

Text: I've been doing some work on personal trauma recently, and I'm curious about how the body responds to these sort of things. Food can often bring up a lot of memories (smell being a powerful sense, of course).

Specifically, I remember having porridge a lot for breakfast as a child - pretty robust breakfast I suppose, with carbs, fibre and some protein. I've not had it in a long time, but had it again more recently and felt I'd been hanging on to more weight than usual, when I look at the scales.

Given childhood, in my case, was often filled with a myriad of stress-inducing situations, including fast-paced mornings where breakfast was often eaten quickly, I wondered if there's any link between specific foods (more than just nutritional connections, like carbs, etc.) and the circumstances in which we first had it that might contribute to how we process foods, excluding potential factors like speed of eating (I understand that can affect these things also)?

Could the stressful situation of childhood breakfast times that perhaps triggers some evolutionary mechanism in my body that thinks it would be better to process certain foods in different ways?

I.e., body thinks something is in trouble in stressful situation, decides that circumstances might be difficult, decides to put food into fat storage for resources, situation repeats and food becomes associated with particular mode of processing.

This could be absolute nonsense, but I wondered if there might be any robust scientific literature on this based on my own limited understanding of ourselves, even if it disproves this. Given how complex our body is though, and the connections it can make between particular things related to trauma, it's a question that sounds interesting to explore.

I suppose it might be referred to as a psychosomatic connection - I've heard that term thrown around, but happy to be corrected on that.

Text: I live near a river that has mercury contamination. My general understanding is that mercury sinks to the bottom, and anything that eats plants on the stream bed accumulates mercury, and by further biomagnification, fish are absolutely off limits for eating. If the mercury is at the bottom of the waterbody, does that mean that plants in the floodplain are safe? How does mercury spread through ecosystems, rivers and ground water?

Text: So  I look up in the sky and I see a star. Maybe the star is close to where  I am looking, but the light has been slightly warped because of  gravitation lensing from another star.

But  how do I - or maybe an astronomer - know that the physical location of  the star it isn't on the other side of the horizon from where I am  looking? Isn't it possible I am actually looking at a black hole and the  starlight has been warped enough so that I see it, but it isn't  anywhere close to where I am looking?

As  an analogy, I am sitting in the stands at a football stadium and I am  staring at the 50 yard line, but I see the uprights and goalpost because  there is a black hole on the 49 yard line (oops) that is  deflecting/warping the light by 90 degrees and toward my eyes.

Text: Hi,

I have a neurobiology course, and I have a doubt about something my teacher wrote in the syllabus of the course.

It  says that ions can circulate through the membrane of a neuron via  receptors, and that there is two major factors influencing the  circulation of ions : 1) an electrical force, due to the eletric  potential difference between the outside and the inside of the cell. 2) a  &quot;chemical force&quot; (sic) due to the difference in ions concentration,  &quot;also called osmotic force&quot;.

I have 3 questions :

1. is the concept of &quot;chemical force&quot; a valid one ?
2. most  importantly, I'm note very qualified in chemistry, but it seems to me  that osmotic pressure is by definition related to the circulation of a  solvent through a semi-permeable membrane... here the ions are the  solute if I'm not wrong... so how can osmotic pressure have something to  do with this ?
3. the explanations of my teacher, are they &quot;okay&quot; simplification, or are they simply false ?

Looking forward to reading you,

If low-power magnification does benefit them more than the average person, will their better-than-average vision mean they also experience a greater benefit from higher magnification optical tools?

I'm only asking about tools focused on magnification of objects and not, say, corrective lenses for farsightedness/hyperopia that a person with above-average visual acuity might need.

1. Malnutrition and illness can stunt the IQ of a growing child. These have been on the decline in most of the world for the last century.
2. Education raises IQ. Public education is more ubiquitous than ever, hence the higher IQs today.
3. Reduction in use of harmful substances such as lead pipes.

Has this effect petered out in the developed world, or is it still going strong? Is it really an increase in everyone's IQ's or are there just less malnourished, illiterate people in the world (in other words are the rich today smarter than the rich of yesterday)?

I presume it’s from previous supernova explosions, which accrued in the solar atmosphere, but do we also know why they are at a particular height. For example neutral Ca is at about 1000 km above the solar surface in the chromosphere. Is there a particular reason for that height or is it random? Long post but appreciate any information!

Text: The Wikipedia article on [Causes of Cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_cancer) sums up the common wisdom thus: 

&gt; **Cancer is caused** by [genetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation) changes leading to uncontrolled cell growth and [tumor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm) formation. The basic cause of sporadic (non-familial) cancers is DNA damage and [genomic instability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomic_instability). 

I recently was doing some reading on non-mutagenic carcinogens, and came upon an article, [*Mechanisms of non-genotoxic carcinogens and importance of a weight of evidence approach*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1383574209000428), which states very clearly, emphasis mine: 

&gt;Non-genotoxic carcinogens are **substances that induce cancer** through  indirect stimulation of hyperplastic responses, **without altering DNA,  chromosome number or structure**. Non-genotoxic carcinogens have a wide  variety of mechanisms of cancer induction including receptor-mediated  endocrine modulation, non-receptor mediated endocrine modulation, tumor  promoting, inducers of tissue-specific toxicity and inflammatory  responses, immunosuppressants, or gap junction intercellular  communication 

There are many similar sources, but this one seems to state the point most explicitly. So, what's going on here? Has &quot;cancer&quot; simply been differently defined back in 2009 than it is now? Has the evidence been overturned that there is such a thing as a carcinogen without genotoxicity? Are they simply so rare as to be of no practical relevance and so knowledge never made it into public consciousness? Some other explanation?

We’ve all heard that 99% of an atom is just empty space, and atoms make up molecules. 

So with all that empty space, what’s stopping the molecules from getting closer together?

Additionally, as something gets colder, it’s volume shrinks. Hot air will rise above cold air. We were also told that was because the molecules are moving faster. So theoretically, a molecule can reach absolute cold and be able to be packed right up next to another molecule, without that 99% of space, right?

If I understand it correctly, blue-footed booby nests look nothing like the bowl-shaped stick nest shown in the animation but instead consist of a few little sticks lying on the ground and a scrape, surrounded by excrement.

Would having to rely more on your right hemisphere for your source of sound make you more creative in that case?

Text: GDP can be measured as the market value of final goods and services. A final good is a good purchased by the ultimate user. So if a bakery buys flour, the flour wouldn't be a final good. But if a consumer buys flour to make bread for personal consumption, then the flour is a final good. 

If a bakery buys a cellphone to handle incoming calls, is the cellphone a final good? I imagine the bakery is the final user of the cellphone. Yet the cellphone seems to be part of the bakery's inputs, so I'm hesitant to say yes.

I've heard that some forms of energy, like plasma, don't block photons though. Can photons (not originating from the sun) pass through the center of the sun and make it to the other side?

Ex. If you had a laser, could you shine it at the sun and then see that laser on the other side of the sun? (Let's assume the observer on the other side of the sun can differentiate between light from the sun and light from the laser.)

Similarly for other forces like the electric attraction between an electron and proton seems to reduce the phase-space of their joint spatial configurations which seems to reduce entropy?

How do we reconcile the fundamental forces with the second law that entropy always increases?

In theory if we had all the relevant information we would be able to predict the outcome of the game with certainty. Is quantum mechanics seen as probabilistic because we can't have all the information in practice due to the uncertainty principle, or is there a deeper reason?

Text: Filariasis or Elephantiasis is a human disease caused by the nematode parasite Wuchereria bancrofti. The adult parasite gives birth to a microfilaria from the lymphatic system. The worm then goes into the human's circulatory system, gets sucked by a mosquito, develops until it is reintroduced to another human host and develop into adults in the lymphatic system. Thus its cycle. I have heard that the mosquito is a necessary step in the cycle, but I don't see why other than it being the transmission vector. Is there another reason the parasite has to go through the mosquito in order for it to develop? Do mosquitoes contribute to the nematode's development? What are the differences between the filaria larvae before it has been ingested by the mosquito and after it has been injected into the human host?

Text: Mandarinfish and related species are the only vertebrates known to have blue pigment.

What is the blue pigment in them? like the chemical formula and all that.

Other blue pigments include the blue blood of mollusks and crustaceans due to copper instead of iron but vertebrates have red blood so that's not it.

Another way blue chemicals form is by combining a pigment of a different color and a protein like the blue lobster or the blue starfish but I didn't read anywhere that this fish does it like that.

As in like are they influenced by which hemisphere they are born in? Or like ocean currents? Idk just scratching my brain. 

Cuz having two identical shells with similar dimensions that are able to latch into each-other but are not from the same local region is a legendary coincidence.

Text: &gt;Wheeler,(1958). Scientific Glassblowing, Interscience Publishers, New York &amp; London. Chapter IV Basic Operations, Page 56. &quot;Milligan has found that the strength of glass containing cracks is greatly influenced by a liquid in contact with the surface of the glass. Exposure of the surface to air saturated with alcohol or water greatly reduces the strength. Putting a drop of water on the crack reduces the strength by about 20% whereas moistening the crack with dry paraffin oil strengthens the tube by about 20%. Milligan does not advance an explanation for either of these effects, but many glassblowers can attest to the accuracy of the statement that water in the scratch reduces the strength of the glass tubing&quot;.

To cut glass, a cutting tool is used to make a scored line, then the glass is tapped or torqued and the stress concentration at the scratch causes the glass to break along the desired line.

Glassblowers always suggest wetting the scored mark to make the break easier, cleaner, and more reliable. Why does this work?

[Here is a video of the phenomenon.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEAxhMECluM)

[Here is a paywalled article that I can't read.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-fracturing-of-glass/)

I assume that it has something to do with damping vibrations, but I'm not sure.

The closest I got was to find a manufacturer of lab equipment (Microfluidics), but they list the machines as their model number (I'm assuming) and not their name which, even if I knew, I don't know which ones are or are not needed for recombinant vaccines specifically.

Text: The textbook answer I seem to find everywhere is that they are a way to **represent** field strength and direction, they flow from north to south and the strength of the magnetic field is represented by the density of the lines in a given area. Sure, that makes sense.

However, my question arises when I physically see lines of flux when I scatter iron filings around a magnet. Surely these are not just a representation but a physical reality. In other words, if they were \*just\* a representation, we wouldn't observe them in the exact same way in physical reality, just as you would never be able to &quot;see&quot; the sine wave representing pressure changes moving through the air when describing sound, because that is not what is physically happening.

I'm curious why everything I can find says that they are merely a representation, and yet we can physically see lines forming from iron filings. What's going on there?

Edit: thank you for the excellent answers everyone! All these answers have collectively helped a lot.

Text: I couldnt find any specifics on environmental dangers of landfills other than methane emissions and leachate secretion, which, for the most part, are being sanitized with the majority of landfills. Do landfills contribute to the locations pollution? Do they effect the fauna and flora around them, and do they have any effects on water cycles?  
Also, why are people so opposed to Waste to Energy plants when they are not only an alternative solution to landfills, but also a means to produce energy?

Text: The reasoning behind my question is based on the idea that charge is compressible.

Water is often used to describe electric current but it seems like gas is more fitting.

Say you had two parcels of air with differing parts per million of some particulate but same volume.(let's say they are in balloons to prevent dissipation)

both could be traveling the same speed relative to the ground although the parts per second would be higher for the higher ppm parcel.

Higher voltage is a higher ratio of joules per coulomb

Higher current is more coulombs per second

Higher Power is more joules per second

Am I right in thinking more energy per charge and more charge per second is achieved through higher charge density rather than electrons moving faster though space?

Text: let's say i have an open circuit with a 5V voltage source, with the positive terminal connected to node A and the negative terminal connected to node B (which are not connected to anything, hence an open circuit).

If take B as a reference point, A should have a potential of 5V.

let's say I have a 2 ohm resistor connected between the positive terminal and A.

The circuit is open, there is no voltage drop across this resistor, hence A still has a potential of 5V.

if I connect a current source across that resistor, say 5A, then ohm's law tells us that the resistor has a voltage drop of 10V.

What i want to know is that does A now have a potential of 5V-10V = -5V? does the voltage drop across the resistor caused by the current cause the potential of the battery's positive terminal to drop across the resistor?

I chose an open circuit as an example, to make the calculation easy, but if the circuit were closed, would this voltage drop in resistor caused by the current source ADD to the voltage drop in the resistor caused by the current flowing in the main, voltage source loop?

Stainless steel is a common example of an alloy.   And in nature we know that veins of pure, or almost pure, metals form which is where we mine them from.   So what is the process of refining or seperating metals from each other as opposed to combining one another?

Text: I analyzed recent scientific articles on the effect of parental age on the probability of producing a healthy kid: https://empirical-wonderland.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-effect-of-parental-age-on.html

However, I am not a biologist or a doctor myself. If anybody is also interested in this topic or has more knowledge on the subject, please have a look at my summary and let me know if you find any errors or disagree with me. Any comments are appreciated.

In a nutshell, I found that the probability of a woman getting pregnant in one year of trying (sex every 3 days) drops from 86% (at 20 years old) to 53% (at 40 years old). The probability of miscarriage also increases from 10% to 25%, while the probability of a birth defect rises from 1% to 15%, with an acceleration in this trend after the age of 40.

For men, the effects of age were less pronounced. The probability of making a woman pregnant within a year decreases by approximately 10% after the age of 40, compared to the age of 30. However, older men also tend to have less sex than younger ones. After 40, men increase the probability of miscarriage by 1.23 times (how I understood, it increases from 10% to 12% for a partner in her 20s, but this could be wrong) compared to 25-29. Finally, advanced paternal age has a significant positive effect on the rate of birth defects. However, the rate is generally low. For example, orofacial clefts have a probability lower than 0.2%. For fathers over 45, this probability is up to 0.3%.

It is a very particular odor that is definitely pleasant, almost sweet, earthy, and very rich or thick- if you've ever cultivated mushrooms of any sort, you know that powerful and aromatic smell I'm talking about.

Text: Hello!

First year bio student, just curious about how there seem to be so many zoonotic diseases originating in birds that can spread to humans. There's also a lot originating from other mammals like bats and rats, but that makes sense since humans are relatively closely related to them, and have really similar body systems and tissues. But birds confuse me as a common source of zoonotic diseases. I understand that they're really effective vectors and spreaders of disease, since they can cover so much distance easily and poop often all over the place, but on a biological system level I don't really understand. Birds and humans haven't shared an ancestor since over 200 million years ago, and have significantly different digestive and respiratory systems.   


Rambling aside, what i'm asking is why are we so compatible with birds in terms of diseases? How do so many diseases infect both birds and humans equally as easily when we're so different? Why do some diseases affect birds and humans, but not other mammals? What do birds and humans have in common that other mammals don't?

Text: The first months of 2023 have seen reports of outbreaks of Marburg virus from several countries in East Africa. Closely related to Ebola virus, Marburg is highly contagious and incredibly virulent, spreads through direct contact, and has no known treatment. How worried should we be about the spread of Marburg virus disease?

Join us today between 12 and 4 PM ET for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology, to look at the known biological, clinical and epidemiological aspects of the Marburg virus. We'll answer questions about the current state of research into the virus, give updates on progress into potential treatments and cures, share steps that can (and should) be taken to contain the ongoing outbreaks, and discuss broad strategies that can help prevent future zoonotic disease spillovers.

Ask us anything!

Fins like fish have wouldn't work for them.&quot;

But like if we extended this, that would mean that at larger and larger scales, water has less apparent viscosity. Does that mean a minnow feels water as being thicker than I do? A whale feels water as being thinner than I do? But they both have similar structures for locomotion. If I were 600 feet tall, would swimming in honey feel the same as me being 6 feet tall swimming in water?

There's just a lot of consequences to this statement that start to pop up if it is in fact true.

I looked around and saw that many sites count their tooth as a horn, but I thought horns were pieces of bone connected primarily to the skull of the animal? I know teeth are like that but it feels like theres a difference since horns (as far as I know) aren't used for hunting as much and are more for physical prowess. So does the narwhal count as an animal with a horn despite this?

I have heard that it changes who you’re attracted to based on physical features ie. from testosterone levels, and looked at past questions here about it. So that does seem to happen, or at least be a likely hypothesis, but I’m also wondering how significant that effect is? Would that happen to every woman that takes it? And how strong an effect is it?

Text: I'm asking this question because I found the geography around Parker Ranch, the first cattle ranch in the Hawaiian archipelago, to be very peculiar. 

North of Parker Ranch is Mt. Kohala which sports a lush forest. The elevation shift could explain the arid region on the other side of the mountain, however, the edge of the forest on the north side of the island is very geometric, suggesting land management as the culprit. A third option could be a mix of a rain shadow + land management but I'm not sure. Further, there could be other factors I'm not thinking about.

Thoughts?

Text: Hi, I hope this is the right category for a paleoclimate question.

There are various reconstructions of past global temperatures based on geological proxy evidence. There are some reconstructions going back 540 million years, though they get less certain as they go further back in time.

But it would be really interesting to know how the Snowball Earth events compared to later temperatures. And what the temperatures were like generally during the Proterozoic and Archean. (I already tried Google but couldn't find much.)

I understand there is less evidence for those times. I know they can't use shell isotopes because there were no hard shells. Still, I'm wondering if there has been any work done to figure out how temperature evolved before the Phanerozoic?

Text: What is the largest in (terms of volume, not mass) object in the universe? I've seen that superclusters of galaxies (Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall) are cited as this, but I wouldn't consider them single entities because of the vast distances between the galaxies. I'm asking for a &quot;single&quot; object such as a black hole, star, or something like that. 

(I know technically speaking even these objects are mostly empty space since atoms never really touch, but you get my meaning.)

Text: Both formylmethionine and methionine are coded by the same codon, AUG, so why isn't methionine mistakenly added in the beginning of protein synthesis, or why is formylmethionine not mistakenly added later on?

Also why do prokaryotes use formylmethionine instead of methionine, and why is methionine used to start protein synthesis in eukaryotes in general?

Thank you

Title: Why do hearts have FOUR chambers not two?

Text: Human hearts have two halves, one to pump blood around the lungs and another to pump blood around the rest of the body. Ok, makes sense, the oxygenation step is very important and there's a lot of tiny blood vessels to push blood through so a dedicated pumping section for the lungs seems logical.

But why are there two chambers per side? An atrium and a ventricle. The explanation we got in school is that the atrium pumps blood into the ventricle which then pumps it out of the heart. So the left ventricle can pump blood throughout the entire body and the left atrium only needs to pump blood *down* a couple of centimeters? That seems a bit uneven in terms of capabilities. 

Do we even need atria? Can't the blood returning from the body/lungs go straight into the ventricles and skip the extra step of going into an atrium that pumps it just a couple of centimeters further on?

Text: It seems so straightforward to test the hypothesis of acquired traits: modify an ogranism, observe that offspring do not express the parent's acquired trait. Is it not simple?

Or do textbooks just reference it to contrast alternatives to evolution by natural selection, even if it wasn't a truly competitive theory?

Text: This entire time I thought alcohol makes your blood sugar spike, however, I just read that when your lover is processing alcohol, it stops releasing glucose and could potentially cause low blood sugar. 

Where does the perception of alcohol = blood sugar spike come from? 

What happens if you consume beer? As it is essentially carbs + alcohol? 

What happens if you eat candy concurrently with alcohol?

Text: We know that one way cancers can evade the immune system is through overexpression of immune checkpoints like PD-1/PD-L1.

Do we know if there are any infectious diseases that take advantage of this too?  It seems like viruses in particular would benefit from this, either coding for the checkpoint molecules directly or tricking the host cell into overexpressing them to tamp down immune responses.

Over the past few days we have seen a surge of accounts using bots/AI tools to answer questions on r/askscience. We would like to remind you that the goal of r/askscience is to be able to provide high quality and in depth answers to scientific questions. Using tools like GPT-3 chat not only do not provide the kind of quality that we ask for but they are often straight up wrong.  
 

As with all bots on this subreddit any account using those tools on /r/askscience will be **immediately** and **permanently** banned.

Type: poem
Text: From fairest creatures we desire increase,
 That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
 But as the riper should by time decease,
 His tender heir might bear his memory:
 But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
 Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
 Making a famine where abundance lies,
 Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
 Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
 And only herald to the gaudy spring,
 Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
 And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
 Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
 To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
