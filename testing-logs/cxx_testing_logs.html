Title: Are non-oxygen nutrients transported by red blood cells, a different kind of cell, or just carried along in the plasma?

Text: How are nutrients transported in the body? As far as I know, red blood cells just carry oxygen. The only other cells I'm aware of in the blood are white blood cells and platelets. So are nutrients just swept along in the plasma? I have no idea how they go from the intestines to the cells that need them.

I've been trying to research this, but I haven't had much luck. I'd appreciate any help you can offer. Thanks in advance!

Text: We all know energy can not be created or destroyed, but I am having a hard time understanding where the energy that causes air currents comes from. I understand that air moves from and area of high to low pressure. But I also know that to move something takes energy. Is this some form of potential energy? How does this work?

Text: I live in rural Colorado. It appears to me that during the winter time when I look at the mountains in the distance the edges seem to be more crisply defined then the same views in the summer time, especially on really cold days. I do not know if this is because the colors are different? Or if it is something psychosomatic? Or does the higher heat on warm days lead to some sort of optical distortion (similar to a low-grade mirage effect)?

Text:  

So my son came up with a hypothetical experiment about a beam that cannot flex and is incredibly long. The beam is placed such that it connects to an axel with a small portion extending past the axel on the other side (think watch hand). Also imagine the whole thing is in space. Could a spacecraft placed at the end farthest away from the axel be propelled to light speed by rotating the short piece on the other side the axel a short distance?

 I think I know that a point moves faster the farther away from the axel because it must keep up with all points closer but has farther to move. Other than this I am lost. This came after talking about about levers and Archimedes quote about moving the world with a long enough lever. P.S. I told him I don't think it would reach light speed but I am unsure as to why except that if this were true it would be common knowledge by now.

Thank you for your response

Text: If a calorie is defined as the energy required to heat 1ml of water by 1 degree Celsius. If I refrigerate a drink to 4c in a fridge and drink it, my body needs to burn more energy to maintain temperature and thus burns more energy in proportion to the volume and temperature of the colder fluid consumed.

So if I drink a cold drink vs a warm drink, am I effectively minimizing calories?

Ex. 1cup (250 ML) @ 4c requires 8,250 calories to be heated to body temperature of 37c

Title: How does Q-switching work? (and more on pulse lasing)

Text:  I'm learning about different methods to create short, powerful pulses in lasers, and am currently learning methods Q-switching and Mode-locking. I have questions about both of them, spawned from reading lecture notes.

**The first questions have to do with Q-Switching:**

They have to do with this part of a reading my lecture notes:

&quot;In a Q-switched laser we stop the laser from oscillating by altering some property of the laser cavity (otherwise known as changing the cavity quality – hence Q!). As an example, we might use a device that misaligns the beam in the cavity preventing lasing. The cavity now has a low Q. This allows the population of the upper laser level to build up and means that the signal is not being fed back into the oscillator so no lasing occurs. A fast switch then changes the alignment of the cavity to a high Q value. This allows the oscillation to take place and the pulse to be released.&quot;

* Is my assumption right that, in order for this to be achieved, &quot;stopping the laser from oscillating&quot; refers to stopping photons from entering the gain medium, hitting a resonator, hitting the gain medium, hitting the other resonator? So, moving the resonator slightly will prevent that, as a photon will hit the resonator that's curved and not hit the other one since the trajectory doesn't allow for it (although that sounds classical.. and photons don't move classically). And what is the oscillator, in this case?
* From what I gather, this is my interpretation: if we tilt a resonator, the photons don't gain properly. This causes emitted photons to hit the gain medium, (The emitted photons from the pump, I'd assume... which I'm not sure if is pumped constantly or pulsed here.. since I know this has to do with pulse emission but I'll explain why I'm not sure if it's pulsed pumping or constant pumping) and then not oscillate back. This means less photons hit the gain, causing less stimulated emission and more electrons sitting at a lasing band, with their high decay time. So, without any incident photons, they're more likely to stay there. Then.. I suppose.. from adjusting the &quot;Q value&quot;, by aligning the mirror perfectly and fast, we get that needed amount of incident photons, and that cluster of lasing band electrons all undergo stimulated emission in close to at the same time? What gaps do I have in this?

**The second question has to do with Mode-locking**

Modelocking has to do with introducing a ton of longitudinal modes of different wavelengths into the cavity. These waves, when superposed, seem to tend to create one larger peak spike when added. This also appears in beats with sound. Why exactly is this? I've heard it may have something to do with Fourier analysis?

**Finally, I have three small questions on general pulse lasing**

Gain switching is described in my lecture notes as &quot;we simply control how long we supply energy to the laser for, and thus how long the laser remains above threshold for. As the laser only emits when the gain &gt; loss, so a pulse of light may be formed.&quot; How does this create a pulse? To me this sounds akin to holding my hand over a flashlight and then quickly removing and putting my hand back to cover it. This doesn't seem like when I remove my hand more light will come out, the same but for a different amount of time. Not more power or anything we think of with pulsed lasers. According to this diagram, Pulse-Repetition Frequency is defined as 1/Tinterval (Am I write in assuming an amount of displacement t on this graph is referred to as time bandwidth? If not, what is it?) Where is the intuition behind this?

[https://i.stack.imgur.com/aISLv.png](https://i.stack.imgur.com/aISLv.png)

One more question. Thanks very much for bearing with me. Am I right in assuming this graph has to do with the varied amounts of intensities with the necessary gain, when going through both resonators and through the gain medium, produce net output gain? What do those arrows represent, (lasing modes.. huh?) and what explains the general curved figure of the graph?

[https://i.stack.imgur.com/DhWO3.png](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DhWO3.png)

I appreciate any time taken to help answer these. I'm new to the subject but it's intriguing, so I'd like to know exactly what is going on so I can develop a sense of pride for this thing.

Text: Going by the equation  G= M🜨/ (r🜨)² = (r🜨)(ρ🜨) (which I think is correct, I don't remember what source I got it from), a planet with twice the mass and twice the radius of the Earth (2/(2)²) would give a surface gravity of 0.5 G. All of this is to say that this hypothetical planet, despite being twice as massive and being twice as large, has a low surface gravity. This leads into my main question: would the low surface gravity mean that this body would have a low escape velocity or would the higher mass mean it would have a higher escape velocity than Earth?

Text: For example, in additive mixing, red plus green make yellow, correct? I always see it talked about in terms of light that is already overlapping, and how that would affect the rate at which sensors in your eye would fire... so, let's  say I have two really bright LEDs, one red and one green, and I start to bring them closer and closer together. At what point will I start seeing, e.g. yellow light? Does this question contain a misconception?  


What about practical or visual demonstrations that also measure the distance required, in terms of things like intensity, for example?  


If you have a red light source on one eye and a green light source on the other eye and they are made to overlap, what colour(s) would you see?

  
I  suppose one could also look at the distance between the components of multicoloured LEDs to get an idea of when they are definitely close enough... but when would they be too far apart?   


My question is meant to be about how the underlying physics relates to compound colour perception. I'm curious about the specific values of the underlying parameters (whichever may be relevant) in common day-to-day situations, at which you'd experience a perceptual transition (e.g. going from seeing &quot;definitely red and green&quot; to seeing &quot;definitely yellow&quot;).

Text: Hey there - I was sent here from r/AskHistorians they said it will be better suited for this subreddit.

I remember first hearing about this theory in the a late 90s/early 00s on Discovery channel.

For those who might not have heard of this: it's the hypothesis that when the Black Sea was reconnected to the Aegean Sea in the Early Neolithic age (around the 7th millennium BCE), the difference in water levels caused a cataclysmic deluge from the Aegean filling in the Black sea. This event would have devastated communities living by the coast. We know that there were lots of Neolithic settlements in Anatolia at the time, it makes sense for settlements to exist on the Black Sea coast as well which would have been wiped out.

As someone who was born by the Black Sea, this idea is fascinating !

I have not heard anything new about this theory (no development since the early 00s). So my questions are:

1. Has there been any subsequent studies done on this ? Or evidence discovered ?
2. If not then has this theory been disproven ? (gradual filling of the Black Sea instead?)
3. Is this theory considered a crackpot theory on the same level as Graham Hancock clickbait ?

According to Wikipedia however, relic neutrinos are estimated to have energies ranging from 10^−4 to 10^−6 eV, 10^10 times lower than the high energy neutrino we’re able to detect with current technology.

I understand that the CMB consists of low energy photons because the radiation gets stretched as space expands. Neutrinos are fermions though, and are known to have mass. Do all particles, including massive ones, lose their momentum as they travel though expanding space, or are neutrinos somehow different?

Text: I received a new, unglazed terracotta tagine (Moroccan clay cooking vessel) for Xmas, which came with directions for curing &amp; seasoning before its first use. I sort of understand the science behind seasoning cast iron, but not this.

1. Submerge tagine in water for 12 hours
2. Let dry in open air for 48 hours
3. Rub interior with olive oil
4. Put in cold oven, set at 350F and leave for 2-2.5 hrs

My questions:

1. What's the point of submerging in water if we're just going to let it dry? What's happening there?
2. When seasoning cast iron, I understand to use oil with higher smoke point and use a much higher temperature in oven, like 450-500 degrees F. Is there any logic behind using olive oil besides &quot;authenticity&quot;? Is the lower temp because of the olive oil, or the clay? Is the olive oil creating a polymer layer, like in cast iron?
3. Is there any reason why the manufacturer would ship this tagine uncured and unseasoned? Is there a benefit for the purchaser/user doing it themselves - like, maybe my tagine is more fragile now?

Text: I've been reading on the history of transplants, and it seems that other than the massive amounts of surgical skill needed, you also needed to to get \*some\* way to make sure the organs aren't destroyed by the recipient's immune system. So which means, I got a question about the discovery of immune suppressives.

1. How do they find it out? I know how antibiotics are found. Plate the agar, and then put in the antibiotics. How do they test out immune tolerance? Do they just mix the blood containing white blood cells, and put in the donor cells, with evidence of donor cell destruction showing that the immune suppression didn't work? Or is there some thing else?
2. How do they create the specific immunosuppressive drug cocktail to prevent organ rejection. Obviously you can't just access and examine the kidney or heart while its inside you. How do they modulate the dose to maximise effectiveness?

Text: I was thinking about the problem of lifting a space craft from the earth's surface to space and for some reason only just now realized that there's an optimization problem here (I think) and I'm curious what the model looks like for this and how it's performed. Suppose I want to lift a mass to an orbit of some altitude, I can compute what energy the system has to have once it's in orbit; what's the best way to generate that?   


Suppose you launch with low power; then you spend more time in a higher gravitational field which means you're counteracting gravity for a longer period of time. I assume that minimizing the integral over time of the force of gravity on the vehicle would save you fuel, which saves weight which saves you fuel... (I assume this converges)  


Suppose you launch with very high power; you accelerate quickly out of the gravitational force but then air resistance becomes an issue and with too much velocity any additional increase in velocity requires O(x\^3) power. At some point it's not efficient to add more power because you'll need a lot more fuel.   


In both of these cases the higher you are the lower those forces are; so maybe a launch system which has a lot more power early and cuts the power later is useful (SRBs are useful here).   


Now, if you build a rocket or launch system with more engines you incur more weight that you're trying to move, also bad. Along with this is the weight of the fuel which goes down over time. The more fuel you have also starts to incur more non-usable weight for the fuel tanks.   


I presume that the effects of wind resistance and gravity create non-linearities in the system since the forces acting at time t are functions of altitude. Is there a model that's used to get started and then iterated on once certain discrete parameters are figured in (that is, you can't add 0.5 engines)?

Edit: I’m familiar with both KSP and the rocket equation. The problem of designing the system seems like a optimizing a function described by a non-linear differential equation which I assume probably doesn’t have an analytical solution. I’m curious about what things get modeled and which don’t and how this is actually done in practice.

Text: I believe I understand the basics of the process. 

You have a gene you want 'disabled', you engineer a specific DNA sequence that contains the neomycin-resistance gene from bacteria as a marker and pray it gets successfully incorporated into the genome of an embryonic stem cell (ESC) and 'knocks out' whatever gene you want through homologous recombination.

Afterwards you let the populations of ESCs grow a bit in culture. After a while, your petri dish contains some populations in which the process was successful and a whole lot in which it wasn't. That's where the neomycin-resistance gene comes into play; you add neomycin to the petri dish and soon it becomes obvious in which cells the homologous recombination was successful and in which it wasn't as the cells that didn't get the neomycin resistance gene die off. At least that's the way I understand it. 

However, how does neomycin kill these (eukaryotic) mouse cells? The way I understand it, neomycin should only be able to 'kill' bacterial cells as they specifically inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. What am I missing?

Text: I've found this claim repeated all across the Internet: that if unused for years or months (a site even says weeks!), the rubber gaskets and seals (some sources mention specifically in the motor) will &quot;dry up and crack&quot;, leading to leaks once it's used again.

I find this a bit difficult to believe. I know UV radiation can cause cracking in rubber and plastic, but dryness? That may be the case with some kinds of sponges, but afaik rubber gaskets or seals don't need to be moist to retain elasticity. Besides, the outer side of the gasket should be dry even when the machine is used. 

Is there a scientific basis for this that I'm missing, or it's a legend that people just hear and repeat?

There are efforts to sequester CO2 underground. Fracking is successful, in part, because of the top secret toxic mixture they pump into the shale to fracture it and increasing oil/gas flow.

In a similar fashion, could aquifers be actively recharged, speeding up that process? If so, are there any feasibility studies underway to investigate this idea?

Text: Most articles I've read on the matter estimate that between 80-95% of individuals that achieve major weight loss regain most or all of the weight down the road, typically within a couple years. Many people, in fact, will become heavier than they were originally. 

It seems that more and more articles are released every week discussing the seemingly &quot;irreversible&quot; metabolic impact of being obese and remaining obese for an extended period of time. 

That got me wondering, if the duration of obesity likely impacts long-term (potentially life-long) metabolic function, could the inverse be true as well? 

Could there be a critical period of time that a formerly obese person must maintain their weight loss before their normal metabolic function recovers or will they always have &quot;obesity in remission?&quot;

Does anyone know of any long-term studies that address this question?

EDIT (17:30): It just occurred to me, many people that lose large amounts of fat tend to lose a significant amount of lean muscle mass as well. I wonder if this may explain some or most of the loss in metabolism observed in some studies or if that's just a gross oversimplification

Text: First of all, I will begin with a copy paste from one source I've read from, which led me to frustration because I think it's plainly wrong.

 &quot;Abyssal Zone: This zone is a continuation of the benthic zone from 4,000 m and below, making it the deepest, darkest, and coldest region in the ocean, which also has the most pressure. Additionally, it has the highest oxygen concentration because more oxygen can dissolve in cold water than in hot water.&quot;

First, abyssal zone is not a continuation of the benthic zone by any means, since the benthic zone is the ocean floor...abyssal zone should be one of the pelagic zones of the open ocean....

Second, even though it is true that oxygen dissolves more in cold water than in hot water, other sources confirmed my doubts by saying there is **barely** any oxygen in the abyssal zone due to no light penetrating which means no photosynthesis.

Can you clear or confirm my doubts? Is the source spreading misinformation?

Text:  Hello, this thing is completely destroying my brain.

HCO3- in renal tubules is &quot;reabsorved&quot; into the circulatory system through a bunch of reactions involving the carbonic anhydrase.

Basically:

\- It combines with H+ forming CO2 + H2O, that can enter the tubular cells;

\- The reverse reaction happens inside these cells: forming HCO3- + H+. The HCO3- is reabsorved into the blood, and the H+ goes back to the renal tubules to restart the cycle with another HCO3-.

I dont get how this is supposed to eliminate H+. Isn't the H+ net equal to 0 ?

Also, how does this make the pH higher? If it reabsorbs the HCO3-, then the H+ used wont be eliminated and vice versa, so I don't see how any of these actions (one or another) could make the pH higher.

Sorry if it is confusing and thank you.

Given a place with a moderate climate, it has been raining for two weeks solid, when the average monthly climate would have say 5 rainy days per month.

Does this say anything about what might come next in the last two weeks of the month? Would you expect those weeks to be less rainy (maybe if whatever circulation patterns exist simply don't support a full month of rain)? Or is it more random like flipping a coin where you can get heads 10 times in a row but the next flip is still 50/50?

There's one thing I don't understand - in the 1970s, when restriction enzymes and molecular cloning were being developed, they were then used to insert parts of human genes into plasmid clones. But how did they know which fragments were from the correct genes? This was prior to PCR so presumably the signal couldn't be amplified, and the recognition sequences are too short to be specific.  


Thank you.

Text: It's well known that having a meal before consuming alcohol (ethanol in this context) slows down its absorption into the bloodstream. A quick google search pegs this at 50% reduced maximum BAC level compared to consuming alcohol on an empty stomach. Without chemistry knowledge, one might be inclined to believe that just about all of the alcohol eventually reaches the bloodstream.

I found out today that ethanol reacts with organic fats (carboxylics only?) to form esters, which do not appear to act like ethanol in the body.

My question is, is this likely to result in a significant decrease in the total amount of ethanol that eventually reaches the blood? If a person ate a fatty meal before drinking, is it possible this could reduce the bioavailability of the ethanol (if that's the right term) by &gt;20%?

One option is to arrange for the melt water to drain away, thus reducing the mass that needs to be heater. However, the water that drains away will cary some heat out of my system. Which effect will dominate? Does it depend on the geometry of the ice block, or perhaps the method of heating?

Text: [NASA's InSight lander](https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/) sent its last transmission on Dec. 15, 2022, after more than four years of unique science work. The spacecraft - which landed on Mars in 2018 - detected 1,319 [marsquakes](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-insight-records-monster-quake-on-mars), gathered data on the [Red Planet's crust, mantle, and core](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-insight-reveals-the-deep-interior-of-mars), and even captured the sounds of [meteoroid impacts](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-insight-hears-its-first-meteoroid-impacts-on-mars) miles away on the Martian surface.

So, have you ever wanted to know how operating a lander on Mars is different from a rover? Or how engineers practice mission operations in an [indoor Mars lab here on Earth](https://youtu.be/q9NptmKlXms)? How about what we might still learn from InSight's data in the months and years to come?

Meet six team experts from NASA and other mission partners who've seen it all with this mission, from efforts to get InSight's heat probe (or &quot;mole&quot;) into the Martian surface to the marsquakes deep within the planet.

We are:

+ Phil Bailey (PB) - Operations lead for the robotic arm and cameras. Also worked with InSight's Earthly twin, ForeSight, at NASA JPL's In-Situ Instrument Laboratory.
+ Kathya Zamora Garcia (KG) - Mission manager for InSight, also helped clean InSight's solar arrays with Martian dirt.
+ Troy Hudson (TH) - A former instrument systems engineer and anomaly response team lead for the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Probe, known as &quot;the mole.&quot;
+ Mark Panning (MP) - Project scientist for InSight, specializing in planetary seismology.
+ Emily Stough (ES) - Led surface operations for InSight.
+ Brett White (BW) - Power subsystem and energy management lead with Lockheed Martin, which helped build the lander.

Ask us anything about:

+ How InSight worked
+ Marsquakes
+ How the interiors of Mars, Earth and the Moon compare and differ
+ Meteoroid impacts
+ Martian weather
+ InSight's legacy

We'll be online from 12-1:30 p.m. PT (3-4:30 p.m. ET, 20-21:30 UT) to answer your questions!

Usernames: /u/nasa

UPDATE 1:30 p.m. PT: That’s all the time we have for today - thank you all for your amazing questions! If you’d like to learn more about InSight, you can visit mars.nasa.gov/insight.

Text: I'll start by saying that this is probably caused by my own lack of knowledge on the subject.  


I hear and read time and time again how it is impossible to know the position and velocity of X particle in a system and how that makes the universe nondeterministic. But as far as I'm concerned that is not a natural law but a restriction caused by our own inability to observe those data points without influencing the system ourselves.  


If in the future there was a way to measure such systems without interfering with them, would that negate the uncertainty principle?   


Or is it instead a natural law that will remain true (If the math holds up) no matter how far science advances?   


Thanks for your answers!

But how can this be explained with a wave model as the dark bands (where waves &quot;cancel&quot; each other) would seem to say the energy from each wave just disappears at those spots? 

 (Whereas in Quantum Mechanics, I assume you would say the photons just don't hit those spots, but all photons do hit somewhere.  Which is also quite odd but at least consistent with energy conservation.)

Everything in the Arctic or Antarctic has intricate crinkly edges: Svalbard, Ellesmere, the Falklands, the Kerguelen Islands.

Tropical islands look totally different, smooth and rounded: Sri Lanka, Barbados, Nauru.

Why's that?

I haven’t verified the validity of this video, but regardless how is it possible to come to conclusions as this with only a fossil?

Text: Hello. I was having a discussion with a friend about snakes and how they go about digesting their food. We kept using the frame of reference that food goes in through our mouths, then through the digestive tracks of the stomach, then eventually out. We figured snakes were the same way, except their digestive tracks are part of their elongated bodies.

Then I started wondering, does food go in one direction then? Is it through the mouth, then slowly pushing toward the tail, where their output mechanism gets rid of it? Or is it through time, the food shifts from going outward towards the tail and upward towards the head, almost like a thrashing, until the food is broken up enough to exit the system?

I'm not sure of these answers. This might be a dumb question on my part. Just curious though.

How do snakes digest their food?

Do snakes use a more powerful acid they have to break down food than humans have?  Is there a rate at which the average snake passes food matter from one stage to the next? If so, how does that rate compare with humans, as its a smaller system?

I'd figure if that were the case, it would be a shorter time span to eat and output waste for a snake, than it is a human, but then again, that could be wrong, maybe its not relative to the size of the system, but the differences in the digestion process from snake to human and back. Who knows?

Might as well ask yall though lol. I'm not a herpetologist but one of you biology folks might be.

Text: Recently I was listening to a podcast and I believe I heard it explained that the human visual perception is different from what people usually expect.

It was explained how people expect that we simply receive input to our retinas and we make sense of it and then give meaning to it, or something along the lines.

However, it was stated that we receive input to our retinas and this input is used to check against an already formed expectation of what we are &quot;supposed&quot; to be seeing. 

Does anyone know what this podcast presenter was basing himself on?

Any articles or resources I've found either just say that it has an impact, or goes into detail on other things, I think because it assumes the reader already understands. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

But how do they know which pixels are red, green or blue? Is the filter array aligned on the sensor with enough precision to know the exact colour of the filter above each pixel, or is there some element of the demosaicing algorithm that allows them to work out the filter above each pixel after production? Or is each sensor calibrated during production to locate the red, green and blue pixels?

And when you squeeze an orange-sized metal sphere to the size of a virus, it will become a black hole.  
But can you squeeze together 50 neutrons and make a black hole?  (let's assume you have unlimited energy available)  
and next ...  can you squeeze 2 neutrons together to form a black hole?  
but next.... can you squeeze 1 neutron together (the quarks in it) to become a black hole?  
and even next.....  if the previous is true, than in fact a quark is a black hole on itself...  Or a quark is composed of even smaller particles that can be squeezed together to form yet another even smaller black hole....  
But if that is true, these smaller particles are black holes on their own, and that is not possible...  


So where is the flaw in this all?

In this he talks about a fascinating field of research in Animal behaviour, about how animals experience time - and how time is expressed in the perception of sound and motion.

Consider my mind blown.

Benn's video implies that the subjective perception of motion, and pitch of sound change for animals with varying levels of &quot;Critical flicker-fusion frequency&quot;.

Is this belief well backed by research? Are there any good places to learn more about &quot;CFF&quot;?

I understand that they work to reduce appetite and slow the digestion of food. But how is it that they do this? And why are these drugs seemingly so much more effective than other appetite suppressants that we've developed in the past? Everything just mentions that they slow the digestion of food and that leads to weight loss, but this feels like an incomplete explanation. Presumably other drugs have been able to suppress appetite, so ultimately my question is if some other mechanism is at play.

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/w3rut0/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxvii/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).

Text: I watched this [Royal Institute lecture (youtube link)](https://youtu.be/S3xH97Su-KY?t=937) where the presenter explains that [Dirac (1931)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspa.1931.0130) showed, that if a magnetic monopole exists, it would explain why the electric charge is quantized as described by quantum mechanics.

I tried treading up on this, but I'm not a physicist and I'm only familiar with QM on a podcast / youtube video level so I'm looking for a more intuitive explanation on why this happens and how this is derived.

- Does the existence of a magnetic monopole imply that the magnetic charge is also quantized?
- Is this a fundamental explanation on why things are quantum in nature or do we have to go deeper than that?

Text: I'd like to start by explaining how I see evolution takes place.

So, small mutations are occurring with every new generation. The new offspring will have new genetics and will progress the evolution.

But in order for these new mutations to spread, that individual needs to have new offspring. Hope I got it so far, please correct me if I'm wrong.

Now, we come to the difference between apes and humans, in terms of chromosome count. We know that at some point 2nd chromosomes fused and we got 1 less pair.

So, my question is, how did this mutation propagate, if species with different chromosome count cant interbreed? Let's say an offspring is born with this new mutation, and he has his/her chromosome fused. First of all, he will most likely look/behave differently than the rest of the tribe, reducing his chance of survival. Second, he would require a peer with the same mutation to interbreed with and spread this mutation. I can see this process unfolding in species that have hundreds of offspring (like laying a bunch of eggs with a lot of them having the same mutation), but can't imagine that in an environment that produces a handful of offspring every now and then.

Text: As the title mentions, based on casual observation, it seems to me that the effective dose of most medicine active ingredients is somewhere between 5 mg and 200 mg. There are of course exceptions like fentanyl which is incredibly potent at the scale of micrograms, and gabapentin, which is often dosed at over 1000 mg, but it seems like most medications are within a narrower range I mention above. This is surprising given vastly different molecular structures of the different medications.

My first question is, is my observation empirically accurate? Or, am I just noticing a non-representative subset of medications?

My second question is, if this is true, why? I know the range i mentioned is pretty large, but it seems narrow when considering total physically possible ranges? Why don’t we see more medications with effective dosages at the microgram scale?

One possibility that occurred to me- is this just a matter of practicality? Consuming multiple grams of medication, although possible, is inconvenient. Similarly, maybe its more expensive to manufacture super potent compounds because of the precision it requires. Are companies just choosing to develop products that work in a more convenient dosing range?

Another possibility that occurred to me- is there some law of chemistry or factor in our biology that makes this the ideal dosage range for many different compounds? E.g., the size of molecules limits potency, the body has some process that clears de minimis amounts of a compound, the average human weight somehow necessitates medications usually be in this range, etc.?

This question has been driving me crazy, so thanks to anyone who can provide some insight.

if you did this regularly, would your immune system be better able to tackle real issues in the future? If so, why don't we do this? and if it wouldn't help, why?

edit: no im obviously not asking about vaccines. I'm not talking about vaccines created to train our immune system against a specific virus.

I'm asking if you're immune system will grow general defenses from simply allowing minor infections.

would strengthening your immune system against generic infections in paper cuts have any benefit to your immune systems abilities to fight other infections? Is there a limit to how *trained* your immune system can be for infection in general? or a specific infection? or specific types of infection?

ok so fine let's ask something about vaccines then. I've had all the generic vaccines that most people do. does that make my immune system better at fighting viruses in general? or only the ones I'm specifically vaxxed for.

For example - in 1930 testosterone normal level in the population is 10 units . So when you have a blood test the normal range is 8-12. 

In 2020 the normal level is 4 units, so the normal range has been adjusted to 2-6

I hope I am making sense, and I really hope to get an answer. To me this makes no sense. For sure adjustments are made based on better science, but not because the population is becoming unhealthier?

The basics I found are that it's mostly normal and harmless.  It can be from injury, cancer (rapidly dividing cells), ageing, or no real reason.  

So I'm wondering what the biochemical process is.  Is there a protein that carries calcium around the body?  What's it called?  What is the chemical trigger that causes it to dump calcium there?  Why would ageing cause it?  Why would cancer cause it?

For an external combustion engine, is there any reason you would prefer cold air to hot air? As in, would air temperature affect the energy output of burning a fuel? Assuming 100% heat transfer from the fire to the boiler, can you make these engines more efficient by controlling the air temperature?

Text: Last night my family and I were debating how the light moves from the electricity (or plasma, whichever makes the electromagnetic radiation) to our eyes whenever lightning strikes.

I proposed that if the light didn't scatter through the droplets and atmosphere, then all we would see is the strike itself and the sky would remain dark. So I was imagining that refraction between water and air as well as internal reflection of the droplets is what causes the light to reach our eyes, not that the sky lights up like a light bulb does.

I also argued that different points on Earth would receive varying levels of light from each strike because of the random nature of water droplets and the structure they happen to form at that moment. So whether a particular strike is bright depends on where you are, not just the amount of energy released. (because different places would receive different numbers of rays, so the sky looks a different brightness. Kinda like how the moon always reflects along a body of water in the direction of the observer, each point gets varying directions of electromagnetic waves)
. This is kinda what I want fact-checked the most.



P.s. I couldn't find anything useful online, just generic &quot;oh, lightning occurs when clouds polarise&quot; and nothing about the path of the light.

Text: Background:

Friend says turbo engines (typically) run lower *compression ratio* than naturally aspirated engines, and concluded turbocharged engines don't require as high of octane as an NA engine of the same compression ratio.

From my experience with ECU tuning, I know that maximum Manifold Absoulute pressure is often (roughly) double in turbo engines compared to NA (NA is retricted to atmospheric pressure: 1ATM/~14.7psi/~1013mbar)

Question:

*Assume all variables &amp; designs (power, fuel economy, displacement) are the same *EXCEPT* for compression ratio, peak MA pressure (MAP), and means of induction.*

Does a turbocharged engine produce higher cylinder pressure than a naturally aspirated engine?

Additional question:

Assume the same scenario as above, but now compare at an equivalent MA pressure. Say both engines cylinder pressure is measured when both engines are at 1ATM (maximum MAP for NA, but typically half maximum MAP for a turbo engine)

In this scenario, which engine will have a higher cylinder pressure?

Text: In particular, what do evidence-based studies say about the effectiveness of the bivalent vaccines against currently-circulating variants for those who have previously had the primary series, the original booster, and who have subsequently had COVID-19. Some previous data suggested that there's a short term (few weeks) boost in antibody titers of a similar magnitude to those seen with the original wild-type booster, but that those gains quickly evaporate back to a baseline antibody level from prior to the bivalent booster. Is there data separating the short and longer term benefits in terms of both transmission protection and hospitalization/death prevention? Bonus points for studies containing data specific to children and pregnant women.

Text: TL.DR: Humans suffer during pregnancy, and many women die giving birth. Does that happen to other animals too? Are we too weak? 

My wife is pregnant (Yey!). She struggles with nausea and tiredness, and everything doctors say is normal during the first trimester. In addition, she is scared about the possibility of miscarriage, complications and, in general, medical difficulties that could endanger her health (and the baby's health). She has been reading a lot about how, in the past, many women died because of pregnancy complications or while giving birth. Today, we wondered: is that kind of thing normal in animals? 

I have never heard someone mention, &quot;oh yes, my dog died because of pregnancy complications&quot;. I have never heard of that happening in wild animals. Maybe I am incredibly ignorant because I live in a city, but I am curious if other animals also have some rough times with pregnancy.

Is that the case? Or is it simply that we humans are weak?

But there are only a handful of antivirals available, and even then, 99% of viral infections I’ve seen are treated by medicating the symptoms and getting bed rest until your body itself takes care of the virus.

Why are antibacterials so common and widely used, while antivirals are basically unseen? Is it something to do with their effectiveness, or how hard it is to manufacture them?

Text: Hi! My name is Tareq Abu Hamed. I am originally from East Jerusalem, and I hold a PhD in chemical engineering from Ankara University. I did my first post doctorate research at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, where I worked at the Environmental Sciences and Energy Research Department. My second post doctorate was at the University of Minnesota, at the Solar Energy Laboratory of the Mechanical Engineering Department. I have published in a wide variety of journals and have received several awards for my research, including the Dan David Prize. Previously, I served as the Deputy Chief Scientist and the Director of Engineering Research at The Ministry of Science, Technology and Space. I also established the Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation at the Arava Institute. I am currently the Executive Director of the Arava Institute and a researcher at the Dead Sea and Arava Science Center.

You can read about my role as Deputy Chief Scientist here: https://www.haaretz.com/science-and-health/2015-03-22/ty-article/east-jlem-palestinian-tapped-deputy-chief-scientist/0000017f-e34c-d568-ad7f-f36f0f2a0000

The Middle East is a global hot spot for climate change and environmental stress on water, energy, agriculture, health and other necessities. Many cities in our region are predicted to become uninhabitable by the end of the century. In recognition of this pressing reality, the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies is conducting a variety of academic and research projects that combines regional environmental diplomatic activity, academic research, and the initiation and execution of projects throughout the Middle East.

One of our great projects is Methuselah. Methuselah is a date palm that Dr. Elaine Solowey sprouted from a 2,000-year-old date seed. This seed, among others, was found during the excavations of Masada in the mid 1960's. In 2005, several of these seeds were obtained by the Louis L. Borick Natural Medicine Research Center of the Hadassah Medical Organization, which gave them to Dr. Elaine Solowey at the Center for Sustainable Agriculture. Dr. Solowey successfully germinated one of these seeds, which sprouted into a young date palm.

Initially thought to be botanically impossible, this successful project has been featured in the New York Times, National Geographic, and other publications. Today, Methuselah has a permanent home in the Arava Institute research park on Kibbutz Ketura.

Text: My coworker has a part (the part is a PCB in a metal housing with the cover off) in a thermal chamber.  It is like a convection oven.  He set the chamber to 105C.  When I view my part with a thermal camera,  I can see the electrical bits are all at the temperature that I would expect.  But the metal housing for the part is closer to 85C.  The unit was in the chamber for over an hour, so it should have been “soaked” by that time.  

I was talking to a coworker and he said that the hot air in the chamber was cooling the part because it was flowing.  But that didn’t make sense to me because I would think that air at 105C would make everything about 105C.  Why does hot air cool metal and reduce the temperature of the metal to below the temperature of the hot air?

Text: Hi there. I am not a geologist, and most of my knowledge has come from seminars on soils or reading online sources. So I am here to ask a question of geologists that I am having trouble finding online.

Lithification of marine sediments appears to be the most common process in the creation of sedimentary rock. It's quite easy to find information on this. However, I have found very little information on whether there are terrestrial processes that create sedimentary rock on land. One could assume that the relative absence of information means it doesn't happen, but I don't want to assume that just because I can't easily find the information means it doesn't happen. So, are there any types of sedimentary rock that form in terrestrial environments, and what are the processes? I have read about cements and conglomerates, are those typically the only ones?

Generally it seems that lithification happens in marine environments, the rock is then uplifted into the terrestrial environment, where it then erodes back to the sea. Does lithification generally not happen on land because the accumulation of new sediment is not enough to replace or overtake sediment loss to erosion?

I'd appreciate any pieces of information or sources on this. Thanks!

Text: I think this is a science question because it's about a natural process. Seriously, where do bears go to hibernate? I'm assuming they instinctually go for safe places where they won't be bothered or affected by weather, and perhaps places that are relatively warm and solitary. I've been led by Hollywood to believe bears hibernate exclusively in caves, but I've lived in places with lots of bears and it's flat forest land as far as the eye can see (Florida). I know there are limestone cave systems, but they're far and few between in most places. I'm just wondering where else in the woods is a good, safe, warm, sheltered, protected, viable place for them to go to sleep for 6 months. Thickets? Fallen tree mounds? Do they dig holes for themselves?Unless they all crowd in together there just aren't enough caves for all of them! Where do the beers sleep???

What is it about scarlet fever, herpes etc. that make them more difficult to vaccinate against than polio, measles or meningitis?

It's been answered for HIV before: it attacks the immune system and mutates quickly - is it the same type of factors for other illnesses, or something else?

Text: All the sample return missions I've seen have their own reentry systems.  Seems like a large weight penalty and extra complication to do so when the craft can rendezvous with the ISS, be taken on board, and returned to earth on a scheduled supply or crew return mission.

Seems that not having to use it's own reentry vehicle would reduce mission costs, or allow for more or bigger scientific equipment to be carried on the probe.

Am I mistaken here or would this not be a nice effective use of having a continuously manned space vehicle in orbit?

So, are their mechanisms the same as ours? Is there any mechanism exclusive to plants? In which case, could we technically implement it in animals as well or understand cancer better?

Text: I might be misunderstanding the concept, but:

If the goldilocks zone is just the sweet spot away from a star that could sustain life, is it possible for that zone to shift as the star goes through different life stages? Or possibly life might evolve differently at different distances?

Does this have a place in our modern understanding?

Update/Follow Up Question: There seems to be a consensus in the thread that this is a valid concept. So...could that mean...we evolved as scientists think we did but maybe we did that on another planet in our our system and had to move to Earth when the goldilocks zone shifted? 

....maybe? Even in a &quot;plausible sci fi&quot; way?

Or is the change over too many billions of years to make any sense?

Text: I understand that the body can use carbs and/or fat as an energy source during exercise, in differing proportions depending on intensity, but what does “burning fat” during exercise actually mean, and how is it different to actually losing fat?

If you do a long, low intensity workout where your body predominantly uses fat as its fuel source, will your body fat percentage be lower when you’re done? Is your body burning fat for fuel the same thing as when it loses fat due to a calorie deficit?

Again, I know there is no possible way to &quot;accurately&quot; determine how much was taken, but is there a rough way to guesstimate? Thank you

Text: The question is a bit hectic but I wasn't sure how to word it properly.

Basically if we consider bacteria and viruses causing illness in humans, are they present for so long only because there was always someone to &quot;pass it on&quot;?

In other words, if we were lucky enough to get to a point where nobody would be infected by smallpox, would that mean the end of smallpox? I know there are of course things like the bacteria being able to survive without a host for some time on contaminated surfaces, etc., but hosts remain their main way of survival, right?

The thought that brought me to this question was whether the wide range of diseases we know today exists because we were never lucky enough for nobody to be infected by that specific bacteria for example.

I was wondering if there is other scientific evidence for droughts in the Euphrates-Tigris Rivers over the last 3000 years. I know there is a drought currently in the area, but have drought events occurred before? Any peer-review articles or evidence you all know of?

3) Since deserts are made of sand can they change collocation in time?

These same fishermen claim that the resulting slurry stays cold much LONGER than just a cooler of ice without the salt. They've done no experiments with timing it, they just make the claim.

I understand the salt melting the ice, and the resulting slurry being partially liquid and the liquid being as cold as the solid.  What I don't understand, or even BELIEVE, without some explanation is that he mass would stay cool LONGER in one form or another.  It's as if they're saying that by adding salt, they've removed even more energy (heat) from the mass.

Sounds wrong to me.  Am I missing something?

Let's suppose we have a very long stick with astronomical length in the range of light years or similar.

This question has been proposed before but I wish to hear clarification on some facts that aren't clear to me.

If we push the stick 10 cm, does it mean the stick is 10 cm shorter before the push reaches the other end?

Is the strength we would have to apply to do that only the strength necessary to move the stick with its given length and mass or is it also needed to add additional force to transiently deform it if the previous question is yes?

Text: Edit : thanks for the replies everyone unfortunately there wasn't a definitive answer but the main points brought up were abundance of calcium ions, it's ability to easily be converted to soluble and insoluble forms and there was one person who proposed that calcium is used for bones since it is a mineral that's needed for other functions in the body.
I look forward to read other replies.

Text: I've recently taken pelargonium cuttings. The mother plant was gorgeous when young, but, as it has aged, it has become less appealing with less flowers. So, will these stem cuttings look like brand new, young plants? Or is it that they'll act like the old parent which is past its best, of a lesser quality than a brand new plant? If not, does this mean the plant can be cloned indefinitely without becoming unhealthy? Thanks.

Text: I guess it's obvious what I'm referring to, i.e. current events over Montana.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_China_balloon_incident

The thing is up in the stratosphere, higher than most planes (and certainly rotor/propeller aircraft) can reach.

I haven't found any discussion of this question online, and I'm sorry if this isn't strictly a 'science' question but there *is* an &quot;Engineering&quot; flair, so I'm giving it a shot.

How could a device like this be brought down without destroying it (as I understand it's hard enough to *destroy* it)? What means are available for capturing a large high-altitude balloon carrying a ton of electronics equipment?

*edit 2 days later*

It sounds like the answer is &quot;wait till it's over the ocean, pop the balloon with a missile fired from an F-22, then pick the wreckage out of the water&quot;.

Now I wondered why that could be and I figured that it must be a combination of my peripheral vision picking up light easier and my peripheral experiencing the same phenomenon that sometimes occurs with cameras.

Text: I'm sitting on my thesis for my history class for uni and analyzing some old local policies from 1718 (from a city government in Palatinate, germany) , which told the citizens to bring a light source with them if they wanted to go outside after a specific point in time in the evening. I was a little bit confused about the determined point of time, being 10pm in summer and 8pm in winter. I thought, why would they set the time that late in winter? Where I live in December at 5pm it's already dark outside. Why force the people to carry a lightsource not until 8pm? Why not already at 5pm when it's already dark especially without having electrical light at that time. That applies to the summer time as well? Why having to bring a lit lantern at 10pm when there is still enough daylight so you wouldn't need a lantern. At least from todays perspective. And on top of that it's even more confusing if you take in account that we have winter and summer time. In the past winter time would be the normal time (UTC+1). Hence my question: How consistent is  the yearly cycle of varying daylight duration from day to day throughout the year in a historical view? Was it the same in 16th century as today? Did it change throughout the millenia? And if so, how much did it change?

How do these viruses stay in the body?

I think I read before that the physical virus 'unit' doesn't stay in the body but after the first infection the genome/DNA for such virus is now integrated with yours and replicates anyway, only normally the genes are not expressed enough for symptoms or for cells to begin producing full viruses?           (Maybe im wrong).

Im very interested in this subject.

Text: When most people think of tick-borne illnesses, the first thing that comes to mind is usually Lyme disease. Yet its closely-related cousin relapsing fever, while not as prevalent, has actually been foundational in the study of vector-borne diseases. Largely unknown today, the story of relapsing fever is a fascinating exploration of scientific research that contains important lessons for modern medicine.

Join us today at 2 PM ET (19 UT) for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), all about relapsing fever. We hope to shine a light on the mechanism and biology of relapsing fever, and to highlight how research on forgotten and ignored diseases can have real impact on health and medical advances.

With us today are:

+ Dr. Phil Stewart, Ph.D. (u/Mercurialdrifter)- Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health.
+ Dr. Tom Schwan, Ph.D. (u/Argasidae)- Special Volunteer, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health.

I hate to post this because it feels so selfish, but news media here are spreading so much contradicting information and I am freaking out honestly. Can someone please explain if all the aftershocks from the Earthquake (some we feel some we don't), can cause some activity in our area that can lead to a devastating earthquake because our buildings here are almost all unequipped and it would be impossible for us to cope with, I fear so much for my families and younger siblings to experience something like that god forbid. 

Please can anyone give me some reassurance or anything about if the aftershocks cause more or less stability in the area? Or anything else I need to know please. Thanks so much!

Text: I know you might think this can be Googled, but the more I look into it, the more confused I get lol. So haematopoietic stem cells become either myeloid or lymphoid stem cells yes? And all blood cells come from either of those? Here’s the confusing bit - my lecturer said that myeloid = neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils, and lymphoid = T &amp; B cells, monocytes, and NK cells, but when I Google it I get contradictory responses. 

Some sites say myeloid cells become all types of blood cells including red ones &amp; platelets, apart from lymphocytes which come from lymphoid cells. So, does that make monocytes and NK cells types of lymphocytes? When I look into that it just starts telling me that dendritic cells and macrophages are both actually monocytes, which confuses things further. Returning to the original point though, some sites directly state that monocytes come from myeloid cells, which is the complete opposite of the lecture material. Can anyone clear this up for me please?

I live in the PNW, and we're always talking about &quot;the big one&quot; on the Cascadia fault and how we're overdue. But are we? We have a few small quakes every year... doesn't that relieve the pressure?

Text: Something I always wondered was why anabolic steroids or HGH are never prescribed to speed up graft incorporation or wound healing. They got a lot of bad press after both were seen as giving athletes unfair advantages, but I don't think we should let that get in the way of a medicine that has its uses.

The longer it takes for a graft to heal, the greater chance a patient can re-injure it.

Edit: Found an interesting paper on the topic that AAS improve recovery time: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34982051/

But I imagine the stigma of a roided out patient prevents widespread clinical use.

Text: Hi all,

MRI scans tend to take around 20 minutes of operation to get the data versus an x-ray (5 seconds) or CT (10 minutes or so). I understand (to a small extent) that the MRI creates a magnetic field that aligns the proton and then when the magnet is then switched off it detects the movements of these protons back to their original state to draw the picture. Why though does this take 20mins? Is it doing this multiple times or just one long charge/release?

Text: I'm particularly interested Urushiol, the substance in Poison Oak/Ivy/Sumac that many people are allergic to.  
My understanding is that repeated exposure to some substances can cause someone to become allergic to it. However, repeated exposure to that same substance can make you immune, or at least non-reactive.   
I'm also not sure of the difference between being immune &amp; being non-reactive? I have read that only 0.5% of the population is truly immune to Poison Oak, while the rest who don't get it are only non-reactive, but can become reactive to it later.   


Lastly, Urushiol is made of a benzene ring with a hydrocarbon tail. I have read that the benzene ring in Poison Oak, Poison Ivy, &amp; Poison Sumac all have the same benzene ring, but slightly different hydrocarbon tail lengths. Would the different hydrocarbon tail lengths be enough to be allergic to one but not the other?  
Can someone help me understand this better? Thanks.

Text: Currently there are pictures floating around Reddit of how the earthquakes in Turkey resulted in a fault line visually having shifted several meters.

What would happen to a person standing right on the edge of this?

Most images show one side moved (like the traintracks one showing the tracks didn't shift on one side, yet having moved several meters on the other side).

So, extended:

* What would happen to a person standing on the moving side.
* What would happen to a person standing on the side that didn't move.

Considering even a whales call can cause physical damage to a person if they get to close, I'm suspecting the release of energy alone isn't particularly healthy, no matter which side you're standing.

Additionally, are there any  known cases of a person or telemetry device experiencing this?

I know diseases like HIV are thought to come from primates, which makes sense: we're so closely related. But H5N1 infecting humans, sea lions, and _birds_? Sea lions are in an entirely different order from us, and birds in an entirely different class! All having distinct and sophisticated immune systems (at least I think birds have sophisticated immune systems?)

Is H5N1 atypical in terms of how it can cause infection in so many radically different species? Or are the animals infected by H5N1 more similar than I realize?

Text: Hi, I'm doing research for fun stuff.

From my understanding of [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-14199-x) article from Nature, the impact winter after the K-Pg meteor was caused by soot (and/or sulfur) in the atmosphere reducing sunlight penetration. And that the 10-ish years of the impact winter was much more responsible for the extinction event than the impact itself (ie. the sonic waves and tsunamis and heat and magnitude 11 earthquake and stuff).

I would like to figure out exactly what the timeline was for the world's recovery after K-Pg. This stuff is surprisingly hard to find, I swear.

I found a [figure](https://www.space.com/36239-dinosaur-killing-asteroid-strike-chicxulub-life-return.html) that said it took 30,000 years for the first microbes to start showing back up again. That feels weird. Why did the article say that the climate would be returned to normal after 10ish years but it still took 30,000 years for microbe life to return?

How long was it before the first big trees? How long until everything was more or less &quot;back to normal&quot; in terms of the presence of flora? Are we talking, like, 200 years or 200,000? At what point after K-Pg could I walk outside and see a green landscape?

Is this number different for fauna? Like, what's the earliest we saw animals thriving again?

I'm going crazy. If you're an expert I'd appreciate book recommendations or articles and whatnot. Point me in the right direction so I don't have to keep hasslin' you :)

EDIT 2: Every day is a new lesson learned. The process of inducing criticality is very very complex. Could someone please write an accurate, succinct summary of how plutonium criticality is achieved so I could put it here?

EDIT 3: I would like to sincerely thank everyone for their insight. From everything I'm gathering in the comments (and please feel free to correct me as necessary):  

Tl;dr plutonium is *compressed* into a very compact density by a precise configuration of explosive &quot;lenses&quot; (shaped charges) in a nuke. Once this density is achieved, the mass achieves criticality. The plutonium itself doesn't go critical until it's either been compacted to such a density that its own radiation will energize it to a point of no return, or as with the &quot;dragon's tail&quot; experiment when a core was made critical by reflecting its own radiation back into it, which in turn caused a chain reaction.

Edit: since this post got so popular, [here](https://imgur.com/a/f2izXmq) is a picture of my &quot;sterilization&quot; setup and what I am trying to sterilize (it is a solution containing fluorescent protein in a glass globe). That glob on the right is some epoxy that frustratingly got away from me during the sealing process, not a growth.

Text: I've been trying to find an answer for this in scholarly sources, but am having trouble tracking down anything discussing it in detail. The most I've been able to find is people noting that organic matter usually ignites on contact with lava, which is obviously true, but I'm curious what happens if it is not able to burn for whatever reason (Perhaps the lava falls on it, and thus cuts it off from oxygen). 

Does anyone know of a paper that would be useful here?

Text: I guess &quot;mindreading&quot; would the the broad term for this, but I'm talking more like being able to record what someone is thinking and hearing when they are dreaming, hallucinating, or asked to imagine the image of a frog, for example. I know next to nothing about neurology, so this is probably way off, but I imagine that we'd have to first scan a person's brain so we can see what electrical impulses are occurring and where, and then we'd have to understand the function of each individual neuron or whatever, and then be able to interpret patterns from whatever the current combination of electric signals are in said person brain. Then we'd have to convert that analog information to a digital visual and auditory representation that can be displayed on a screen. But I suppose one of the biggest problems is that everyone's brain is different, so even if you could interpret one person's brain, it wouldn't work on another. You'd have to have some kind of AI that could dynamically analyze the pattern of any given person's brain and understand how it functions.

Again this is just my uninformed, speculative rambling. I'm interested to hear from more knowledgeable people how this could actually work though. The benefits of such a technology are truly mindblowing. Imagine the creative potential for art, music, fictional writing, movies, etc., if we were able to do this? Imagine being able to actually see and hear what a person experienced during a sleep paralysis episode! True horror movie potential right there. Imagine what we could learn about people with mental illness, or learn about the similarities in how we all think. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

I am currently having difficulty understanding the difference between a free radical and a radical neutral. I know a free radical is any transient species, but how does that differ from a radical neutral? My research is into plasma characteristics, and a quote from the paper I am reading states, &quot;the most important parameter in low-temperature plasmas is often the density of the radical neutral.&quot; I'm not too sure what this means without understanding radical neutrals.

Any clarity on radical neutrals/the above quote would be much appreciated! :)

To prevent this, we take immunosupresant drugs that weaken our immune system to the point it cant effectively kill our organs.

Text: To be specific: Do we know of a bacteria, virus or a less-obvious category of infection that can affect both an animal and a fungus? I imagine plants are too far removed to have overlap but the same question remains.

It can be assumed the resulting disorders from the infection would be far different but the concept doesn't seem as rare as a google search would imply.

Text: Since I'm not any versed in neuroscience. I have read that there are some methods where which the brain tries to functionally recover. This involves neurogenesis and neuroplasticity.

From my understanding, with not as much research, neurogenesis isn't going to replace damaged cells, but it will help functionally promote more cells of the damage brain in places like the hippocampus and the amygdala. Neuroplasticity is when the brain rewires where the damaged brain function is to another part of the brain to get it to work properly. Maybe a section of one side of the hippocampus isn't functioning properly, that hippocampus function might be rewired to the other one or another part of the brain entirely.

Hello all, 

Are there any cases where an individual might test negative (outside of the window period) using HIV RNA PCR &amp; antibody/antigen testing despite actually being positive?

Is it possible that someone might have some weird/rare mutation that causes the HIV RNA PCR test to not detect any HIV despite it being present?

If so, would that mutation also impact the HIV antibodies to where they are also not detectable?

We've experimented with dough, meats, vegetables, sweets, made a seven-ingredient slice of cheesecake, and printed chicken samples which were then cooked by lasers. Currently, we are focusing on building robust software and hardware to incorporate more functionality to print food of different consistencies and multi-ingredient combinations to fully showcase this tech's potential.

In August 2022, my work was featured in Interesting Engineering, and the publication helped organize this AMA session. Ask me anything about the technology behind 3D-printed food, the how-tos on printing food, how lasers can cook food, how 3D-printed food can be inventive, nutritious, and customized for each individual.

Assuming you can control the frequency (and hence the energy) of the photon, you can theoretically send a photon of any arbitrary energy towards the atom. Let's say that the energy required to excite the electron from the 1s state to 2s is 1. (Some arbitrary units) And the energy to from 2s to 2p is 0.5 in the same units. Now if I fire a photon of 1.4 energy units, where does the extra 0.4 energy go? There's no further sub quanta of energy it can excite the electron to. Does that mean that such a photon will never be absorbed by the atom? Is there some non quantized sink of energy it can go to, like the kinetic energy of the atom or something like that?

But if the water is held together only by cohesive forces, how does it change with &quot;depth&quot;? In the book they were free floating and various sized

Water is less dense as a solid so pressure causes it to melt, so I'm not thinking there could be a solid core by pressure.  I'm wondering, if there was a drop of water 14 miles across (so the center is as far from the surface s the Challenger Deep), what would the pressure be at the center? Could we scuba all the way through?

Maybe it would help to imagine a spherical &quot;drop&quot; of water of radius (depth) x, in free fall, with enough of a &quot;balloon&quot; around it to prevent heat loss and evaporation but not add and &quot;squeeze pressure.&quot; How would pressure change through the pond?

Every year, [more than 300,000 people worldwide die from complications related to seasonal influenza](https://www.who.int/teams/global-influenza-programme/surveillance-and-monitoring/burden-of-disease). Even though the yearly flu shot [reduces infections, decreases hospitalizations and prevents thousands of deaths](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/vaccineeffect.htm), there is clearly more work to be done. Further complicating things is that many of the typical symptoms of flu overlap with symptoms of COVID-19, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection and the common cold.

Join us today at 2 PM ET (19 UT) for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), about seasonal and pandemic influenza. We'll answer your questions about why we need a different flu shot every year, talk about the process of identifying, making and delivering the flu vaccine, and discuss strategies for minimizing (and hopefully preventing) the spread of influenza. Ask us anything!

But still, one would imagine that given the major physical similarities (due to similar pressures, I assume), and the tail being equally important to both crocs and gators, the pressures that caused the alligator to develop/retain its tail regrowth trait would also apply to crocodiles. So why can't they do it?

Text: I saw a post about chickenpox in this sub and the common spots, but this made me wonder why hand foot and mouth disease (coxsackievirus A16) specifically causes blisters and rashes on these extremities. I am not well versed in virology or histology, so if this belongs in another sub please let me know (like r/Nodumbquestions) Thank you!!

Edit: Y’all I know WHY it’s called Hand foot and mouth 😭 thank you for clarifying. I’m asking WHY the blisters form on the hands, feet, and in the mouth rather than indiscriminately all over the body, such as with other viruses like varicella (chickenpox)

I've spent a lot of time around volcanoes in the PNW, from Mt. Baker to Shasta, and never seen that quantity of cinder cones on any of them (although Adams does have a very distinctive cinder cone on the north side.)  I assume at least some of them would be erased by glacial activity, but apparently Moana Kea used to have glaciers.

The state space has many more dimensions than those 3 variables, so a bunch of states can be transformed into the same one. This relies on Hawking knowing that a black hole is not affected by timing of consuming matter, non-electric charge aspects of the matter (such as chemical composition), and all those other dimensions in the input space. How could he have narrowed out all those input variables?

Text: Hi, I'm Ben Masters, wildlife filmmaker and ocelot enthusiast. I studied wildlife biology at Texas A&amp;M University and founded the production company [Fin and Fur Films](https://www.finandfurfilms.com/about) in 2015. 

There are fewer than 120 ocelots remaining in the US. With many factors acting against them, there is still hope for their survival, if opposing parties can come to an agreement on their management methods. I've spent years in Texas capturing the first-ever high-quality footage of American ocelots in the wild, meeting with stakeholders along the way to raise awareness about conservation solutions.

You can learn more about these efforts in the recent PBS Nature documentary &quot;[American Ocelot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiQ8zOlWHUQ&amp;t),&quot; now available to stream in the US.

I'll be answering your questions at 1 pm ET (18 UT). Ask me anything!

Text: Let's say an astronomer notices something worth studying out there.... How do they tell other astronomers around the world, or just record exactly where they are looking at? For instance for coordinates on Earth they'd give a lat/long and that would always be the same place.

&amp;#x200B;

But in space, everything is in motion and therefore relative to the observer.  The earth is moving in space, and rotating as is whatever object is being studied.    So on any given day, or even time, the object being studying is not going to be in the same 'relative' space as it was yesterday, etc....

&amp;#x200B;

So how are coordinates marked for collaboration or future study?

Text: Now that NASA is planning on colonizing the moon, and possibly mars soon, I had a thought that's been lingering in my mind.

Say for example, theoretically. We built a space elavator or just a very long wire that carries data from mars to earth, or just moon to earth, and say it's a perfect cable that has 0 ping.

Relativity states that the more massive an object is, it dilates time around it. So if we go further from the earth say a vaccuum of space such as the moon, there would be time dilation right?

If we set up a skype call using that &quot;data elevator&quot; with the people on the moon or mars, would we see them as they were a few nanoseconds ago? Meaning will there be a noticeable time dilation or does time dilation go out of the question since we're now observing them in real time?

Text: From what I learned in high school, every B cell in every lymph node is entirely unique since the structure of the surface receptors is randomly generated, causing each B cell to recognise a different antigen. However, whenever there is an infection in the body, it always seems like the closest lymph nodes are the ones active, eg. under the jaw during a cold, or under the armpit after a vaccine. Wouldn’t there be just as much chance that the B cell able to identify your sore throat antigens lives in a lymph node further from the site of infection like the groin, ect.? Does the B cell travel to a closer lymph node  once activated? Or are there many different B cells that can recognise an antigen to varying degrees, and the closest ones mount the fastest immune response, even if a B cell further away could do a better job?

Text: (Quick info to start with, I'm from Germany, so I may make some mistakes with the technical vocabulary and some best practices may differ)


So this is a kinda awkward question for me to ask, considering I'm an electrical engineer planning the electrical systems for all kind of construction projects, and I like to think I'm quite good at it, including the technical side.


But during a conversation with a colleague yesterday, we noticed we both can't quite explain how exactly the drection of the flow of power is measured in AC power systems (compared to DC, where it's really easy). We both know it's possible, we both have watched old electricity meters (like [this one](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Drehstromzaehler_offen.jpg)) run backwards when either wired incorrectly or when the measured system is actually feeding power into the mains, for example with solar panels. And while I understand the basic principles of those old meters (it's essentially a finely tuned linear induction motor), what I can't figure out is how the **direction** of the powerflow is determined. Even worse with modern electronic meters, those don't even have moving parts where I could at least justify that they work the same as the old ones. And yet those to can determine the direction and don't measure currents running in the opposite direction (for example again with solar panels when you don't actually have a contact for receive compensation for the power you provide. The meter simply doesn't count up or down when you produce more than you need and thus are feeding into the mains. Mechanical meters solved this with a ratchet system.)

AC power doesn't have an inherent direction, that's its fundamental principle. So how do those meters do it? The only thing I can come up with is that it's basically more like &quot;measuring&quot; the voltage differential between one side and the other, or at least that that is what determines the direction. But *how*? What physical effects are used to electronically measure if power is flowing from A to B and when it's going from B to A?

Thanks for any explanations you can provide, the more detailed and in depth the better.

Text: We're the Auto Terra Project, one of the top 25 teams in the US competing in the NASA Deep Space Food Challenge, a competition to create the Mars habitat food production system.  This system will be used to feed the astronauts at every step of the mission.  You'll see us listed on their website as the Arrakis Terrarium Project, as we recently rebranded: https://www.deepspacefoodchallenge.org/teams

Our solution centers around enclosed ecosystems!  Think of a 4 foot by 4 foot by 26 inch (1.2 meters by 1.2 meters by 0.66 meters) climate-controlled community garden plot in a box, complete with a water cycle, lights, temperature control, humidity control, sensor data, and more.  The internals are separate from the externals, meaning that the plants have an ideal environment despite what's going on outside.  We have proof of concept, and if you would like to see our prototype, some of our harvest, and our work, feel free to check out our website: https://autoterraproject.co/

We would also like to someday use our devices to strengthen food security on Earth by partnering with nonprofits to put these into the homes of people in need.  The devices require 0 daily maintenance and allow the users to access fresh foods whenever needed, without having to worry about supply lines, costs in grocery stores, or transportation.

If you'd like to support us, the biggest thing you can do is to get on our website and sign up to our email list!  It'll help us show others that our project is important and aid us in getting additional funding to continue our work.

The people answering questions from our team include:

+ **Ariel Shramko** (/u/ATPSpaceFood) the environmental engineer on the team.  They create the criteria for the ecosystem, create the ecosystem itself, monitor the health of the units, and complete some of the chemical engineering within the project as well.
+ **Eliot Pirone** (/u/Necessary_Ad_126) the mechanical engineer behind the physical design of the project.  If Ariel determines what the units need to do to maintain healthy environments for the plants and changes the living matter within the ecosystems, Eliot figures out how to make that happen.

The team will begin answering questions at 12pm EST (17 UT). Thanks for listening, AUA!

Text: I was recently discussing how hard it is to retrofit online multiplayer onto classic arcade games, as they expected the other players input to be right there on a wire plugged into the PCB. However one earlier solution to this was used by the [XBAND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XBAND) service, where each user would run the game locally, but with lock-step inputs of their own controller and the remote player, who was dialled directly into your XBAND adapter.

My real question is, what would have been the latency of such a direct call? Assuming two users in urban environments, say one in San Francisco and one in Los Angeles. Every resource I can find talks about general internet latency in the dial-up era, but that involves routing and multiple machines, or talks about modern cell-phone calls, which have a more complex set-up and teardown. You're directly dialled into someone else, it's a voice call, what's the latency on that?

Were Neanderthals ever competing against early humans without the gene change?

What are the influenza contagion mechanisms that determine when you are contagious?

* How long do the effects last? Could you lay down for 10 minutes before a visit to the doctor to gain back that height?

Text: I've always observed this when looking out of the window on trains and now I started noticing it also shows on other dual-pane windows too but never on normal windows. 

The thing I'm describing is most of the times really subtle, and it can be described as seeing two really close (almost matching) reflections of one random object. One of these two is &quot;shifted&quot; towards a color (e.g. purple) and the other one has its color modified towards the complementary one (in the example, yellow). 

Where the two reflections overlap the color is the same of the object, but as I said they don't fit perfectly and this results in the object having an &quot;aura like&quot; edge (in the example the reflection would show a slightly more purple edge and a yellowish one on the opposite side). 

I know this has something to do with optics and wavelengths but I can't get my head around it. Can someone help me figure it out?

The closest I can find is [these](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01351-4) two [articles,](https://www.nature.com/articles/154013c0) with the second giving a minimum vision that seems equivalent to X-rays using the math I have.  Even the conventional range of lux (100 microlux to 100 Kilolux) doesn’t feel like it’s expansive enough because it’s constrained to sunlight.

Edit: It specifically doesn’t feel sufficient because we can see stars in the night sky, as per the [lux definition.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux#Illuminance) the maximum is also too low because surfaces under the sun aren’t blinding.

Text: What is going on?
A piece of raw meat is moderately firm, if supple.
Cooked well, it becomes phenomenally soft tender and soft, such that it barely requires chewing;
HOWEVER, with the heat applloed differently, it can char into an even firmer, harder, state.

What's going on chemically?
Obviously the intensity and time of the heat applied plays a role; what other factors are involved? Are there consistent principles? What are they?

Thanks much!

Text: I understand the very basics of how CAS9 enzyme cuts off a gene with a guide RNA to help it locate,, but what's still unclear to me is what we do with the DNA breaks

• If we let the cells repair it by themselves, will they not just remake the segment we just cut off?
• If we insert a new gene, how exactly do we deliver it? Does it come with the CAS9 and guide RNA complex? Or do we use another enzyme to deliver it separately?

I've just started learning about this topic so I'm sorry if my question seems very basic. I've tried searching online it but so far I've only gotten things like, &quot;We insert the gene...&quot; &quot;We deliver the new gene...&quot; or &quot;The new DNA segment is delivered&quot; without specifying *how* it was delivered

I understand why smuggling gold OUT of the country could be harmful, but what economic harm could come from smuggling gold IN? Presumably people are smuggling gold so that they can sell it for fiat currency. I would think that exchanging their less valuable, inflated currency for a more tangible asset like gold, which holds its value and could be exchanged for more valuable foreign currency, would be an overall positive for their economy.

I have recently learned, however, that the Oklo natural fission reactor is known to have at one time produced elements as heavy as Fermium. When the phrase &quot;heaviest natural element&quot; is used, how exact is that statement? Is there an atomic weight where it is theoretically impossible for a single atom to have once existed? For example, is there no possible scenario in which a single atom of Rutherfordium once existed without human intervention? If this is the case, what is the limiting factor? If not, is it simply the fact that increasing weights after uranium are EXTREMELY unlikely to form, but it is possible that trace amounts have come into existence in the last 14 billion years?

Or put another way, do subatomic particles experience collision/volume like mass at a macroscopic scale (or does another force provide a similar property)? My understanding is that collision as we experience it is a result of electromagnetic forces.

Assuming the crew that turns the lights back on doesn't introduce new microorganisms to the environment, would the bodies actually decompose when re-exposed to oxygen and heat, or would they be preserved?

If you have a neutron in, say, a helium atom... that neutron is stable for billions of years.

Contrast this with a free neutron, which has a half life estimated to be somewhere between 10 and 15 minutes. Free neutrons decay into a proton, an electron and a gamma ray (and an antineutrino or something like that?)

So what is it that makes such a huge difference in the stability of neutrons (in a nucleus vs free)?

1. it's all about the ganos fault (GF) ; a segment in the north anatolian fault (NAF) located in turkey and which is the cause of many earthquakes. The GF was examined using geophysical tools in order to decipher its tectonic evolution, its morphological and structural properties, its fault-fluid relationships. But to obtain comprehensive results they used the magnetotellurics method (it's bc of the fluids in the pores but can u explain me the whole process with a logical structure)

2.There's a topographic map and i don't understand how it works with the geological periods (for example miocene then eocene and alluvium why ?)

3. And finally what is 'dimensionality' and what are 'galvanic distortions' ?

I'm also the lead on the initial Mineralogy/Petrology of the meteorites found by the Australian Desert Fireball Network (DFN), an interdisciplinary research group that is working to uncover the mysteries surrounding solar system formation. Digital observatories, part of the DFN, monitor a third of Australian skies, all night. The DFN images and studies the paths of fireballs in the sky, their trajectories, and orbits using intelligent imaging systems. As a geologist, I want to know where rocks come from, along with their composition and distribution. Trying to mesh those two is kind of the holy grail in figuring out what the solar system is really like. In 2006, an asteroid was named after me - Asteroid 6579 - for my contributions to planetary science.

In August 2022, my work was featured in [Interesting Engineering](https://interestingengineering.com/science/astrogeologist-space-rocks-important), and the publication helped organize this AMA session. Ask me anything about asteroids, meteorites, planetary science, and my work with the Desert Fireball Network.

Text: I've been looking at things like using [solar panels on water canals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCRX232VkBk) and other man made structures for water, in addition to technology just meant to reduce evaporation.   I see a bunch of figures like &quot;decreases evaporation by x%&quot; and it's being peddled as a solution to water crisis in dry areas (now made dryer due to climate change).  What I don't understand is that water has to get into the atmosphere to cause rain and other things.  So decreasing evaporation here reduces the amount of water going into the atmosphere.  If you aren't *increasing* the amount of water in the system (say in California), then you still have dry-problems, accept now, your soil might be even drier due to the humidity being lower over all, and you may even be affecting climates around the area inadvertently right? 

The only positive sum game I can see with this is if this somehow caused more *ocean* water to contribute to for example, the California climate.  

**So does preventing evaporation on these structures ultimately cause negative environmental impact over the long term?**

Although it seems rare, patients can be awake and sometimes need to move while connect to the ECMO. 

Since your urge to breathe comes from the build up of carbon dioxide in your blood (carbon dioxide that the ECMO is removing), does this mean a patient on an ECMO doesn't feel the need to breathe or is this an oversimplification?

Text: Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Economics, Political Science, Linguistics, Anthropology**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for 'X' were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;.

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

If you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/about/sticky).

Text: A common conspiracy theory you hear, particularly in the &quot;targeted individual&quot; community, is that military/intelligence agencies have the technology to secretly detect brain activity from a distance and extract meaningful information from it and even modify said brain activity without any conspicuous or invasive device. Basically remote mind reading and mind control. 

They often cite patents such as these as proof this technology exists or has been worked on: 

https://patents.google.com/patent/US3951134A/en

https://patents.google.com/patent/US6017302A/en

I was arguing with someone who believes this and it got me wondering about the technical feasibility of this concept. I don't know enough about neuroimaging and EEG to answer the question.

if an object at rest on earth is lifted to a higher altitude then the kinetic energy required to do so is converted to potential energy? 

so is there a limit to this?

If an object is lifted higher and higher until it is only negligibly affected by the earth's gravitational field, does the amount of potential energy it gain keep increasing too?

If so, is there a standard way to convert that into human-visible color in RGB terms, given an ISO-standard monitor?  Is there an industry standard calculation between the output of a visual-wavelength telescope and an image on nasa.gov?

Text: I know this seems like a broad question, but I didn’t know how to summarize my question adequately for the title. I’ve been trying to understand different evidences of common ancestry, and one topic that had been brought up was the discovery of endogenous retroviruses and their presence in the human genome and other animals, which points to a common ancestor.

To clarify, my question is how do we know the retroviruses found in our DNA and the DNA of other species are from a virus infecting a common ancestor, and not a result of a prevalent virus in the past that infected multiple species around the same time, resulting in an alteration of the genomes of different species but occurring around the same time? If that makes sense.

I don’t necessarily believe that, but growing up in a very conservative, 6-day creationist, Christian household, I think that it’s a thought that could pop up in response to the ERV findings, so I am interested in what the rebuttal would be. I am not knowledgeable at all in these areas, and so I’m grateful to anyone who can help me understand and learn this in a simpler way, if possible. Thanks!

Text: Recently i came across a similar question in another field here (meteorology) that i've been asking myself, which reminded me of this question.


I'm more interested about the physiological/neurological perspective. External solutions like exoskeletons are fascinating too, but at least for me they are a separate less medicine more technology matter.


The 30 year time frame is somewhat arbitrary, tough i picked it cause it's the point in time before computers and the benefits they brought along become more common. Also i assume that the care improved a lot when tomographic machines became more widespread.

Text: Google search is telling me 2 completely opposite things.

On every video about orbits it always shows the orbiting body moving faster the closer it is to the thing it is orbiting. As well as this spacecraft often use a planets gravity to slingshot to their next destination, which again implies an increase in velocity.

But if our planet is constantly accelerating and decelerating depending on its position in the orbit of the sun, wouldn't we feel it?

Text: This is probably a very stupid question but Google does not seem to help at all and it's been bugging me for the last 2 hours. 

The title is a very shortened and simplified version of my question, so let me explain it in more detail.

For example, a (obviously homozygous) blonde man and a homozygous dark haired woman had a female child. The daughter would be (again obviously) heterozygous, hair color-wise, meaning she has one allele coding light hair from her father and another one coding dark hair from her mother. By the laws of (probably highly simplified) genetics, the daughter would have inhairited dark hair, as the dark hair allele is the dominant one in her genotype. However, as I understand, to make sure both famale and male organisms have roughly the same level of gene expression in both sexes, RANDOM one of the X chromosomes in female organisms gets inactivated. Now back to the whole cat fiasco. I was reading about tortoiseshell cats and everything made perfect sense to me. Since one of the cat's X chromosome located alleles codes for orange hair, and another variation of it codes for black, AND  one gets inactivated with basically a 50/50 chance, the cats fur presents as a black-orange mosaic depending on the pigment amount/pigment variation coded in a specific cell. Back to our heterozygous daughter. Why isn't her hair a blonde-black mosaic? If the chromosome inactivated was inharited from her mother, the strand should be blonde and vice versa.
Now, I do have some theories about why that doesn't happen. For once, this overly simplified model of hair color inharitance is basically high school level genetics, so I'm sure someone's true hair color is determined by a variation of many genes. 
Another explenation would be the hair color genes only being situated on the 23rd pair in cats. 
Unfortunately, this just raised more questions in me. It can't only be cats then, right? Does any other mammal have this fur variation or something analogical? It also can't possibly only affect hair color, surely there are other alleles on the sex chromosomes that would fit into this weird expression loophole. 
While answering, try not to be to rough. I'm only just out of high school and about to re-take my finals. I'm very passionate about biology and so interested in genetics, but sometimes I just don't completely understand. Hope I got the terminology right, my Polish high school offered an &quot;English speaking&quot; biology class but the teacher actually didn't speak any English and she would just resort to handing out some English homework she stole of the web, lol.

The other side of the closet had the same geometry and it was impossible to paint that spot with my dominant hand so I had a crack with my non dominant and did a half decent job. (there were shelves built into the closet so it was impossible to step inside to be in a better position.) 

For a summer job I cleaned windows on high rises (look up rope access if you're interested) and from the outset my boss trained me to practice cleaning with both hands while learning so I could cover more area at once.

*tldr questions start here:*
Anyway, this got me thinking, when a surgeon is digging through a body cavity, are there any awkward spots? Do you ever find that you can't reach from a particular angle and the other hand reaches better? Is this really bad practice? Do you just reposition your paitient? Are there more reachy tools that do the trick? Ever been forced to abandon a procedure because you've realised you've come from the wrong angle? Are there any skills that you by default train yourself to do ambidextrous because it'll come in handy? Or is this never an issue?

So forgive the ramblings of this madman. Genuinely curious as to how this all works.

Text: I genuinely tried my best to reaserch this on my own but couldn't find the information i need.

My    understanding is that EE2 is not like, say, Estradiol valerate or    estradiol hemihydrate just estradiol with something to transport it but a    different hormone. Is that correct?

I    looked at the chemical structure and wondered what it is that makes   EE2  interact differently with the (intracellular) estrogen   receptors(120%  at the ERalpha and 44% at the beta receptor; compared to   E2) [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Affinities\_of\_estrogen\_receptor\_ligands\_for\_the\_ER%CE%B1\_and\_ER%CE%B2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Affinities_of_estrogen_receptor_ligands_for_the_ER%CE%B1_and_ER%CE%B2)

Is it understood why that is? Is it possible for a hobbyist to understand the biochemical reason for that?

If anyone could explain this to me or give me a hint what so search for I would appreciate it. Thank you very much in advance.

Text: On my weather app on my phone I always see the temperature line across the week and I just noticed that during winter the peaks and valleys are a lot shallower than in summer. So I checked historical data from my location and indeed, on clear summer days, the temperature can reach 35 degrees celsius during the day and drop to around 15 at night, that's a temperature change of 20 degrees. In winter, the biggest change I found for my location is 10 degrees. But overall, it seems to me that the changes are more dramatic in summer than in winter.

Is it overall cloud coverage? Is it absolute humidity? Is it the energy cost of water freezing and melting? Or is it just my location that is like this?

Text: I have been wondering lately what the theoretical top speed of a helicopter would be. I have a basic understanding of retreating blade stalls and keep seeing it listed as one of the main limitations to a helicopters top speed, along with the advancing blade eventually breaking the speed of sound creating shockwaves and the more obvious ones like drag.

In theory if we imagine we have a helicopter with an infinitely powerful engine and made of materials that would never be damaged from heat or the forces caused by flying at high speeds, would these limits still apply? If it is a coaxial helicopter then the retreating blade stall shouldn't be a problem as it would be stalling on opposite sides at the same time and if the rotors are made of this theoretical material the shockwaves wouldn't damage them. Would this theoretical helicopter still have some hard limit to the maximum speed it could achieve?

Text: I'm writing a story, and one of my characters who is intersex has a child at one point. I thought it would be poetic and be a great part of his arc if his kid was intersex like him, allowing him to guide his kid in a way he was never guided. However, considering how low the chances of obvious intersexuality are (which doesn't count very minor intersexuality or intersexuality that is entirely internal, and therefore unnoticeable), it would seem sort of contrived if his kid also happened to be intersex. However, if it's hereditary, that wouldn't be an issue. So how does that work, exactly?

Thumbs in primates are obviously quite beneficial while the fifth finger for animals like dogs are not too useful. But they generally always have a fixed number. When did vertebrates (or animals in general) converge towards this constant number? Do we have fossil/current evidence of animals which did not follow this number? I understand if the answer to this might not be fully clear, but do we have an idea as to why animals converged to 5 and not any other number? Are slightly more/less fingers any more or less beneficial for most vertebrates?

It dives into numerous utopian and radical subcultures, from cryptoanarchists, cypherpunks, and gold-standard libertarians to Extropians and transhumanists, all of whom - as it turned out - were tied into the project of trying to invent computational money. 

I was recently featured as one of the experts in NOVA's documentary film, &quot;Crypto Decoded&quot;, about the history behind cryptography and cryptocurrency. You can watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnavKPl5f9I

+ Will crypto change how we think about money?
+ Where else is cryptography used?
+ How did cryptocurrency begin?
+ Are cryptocurrencies hacker-proof?
+ What problems has cryptography solved?

Text: Does there exist a gas that changes in response to magnetic fields in its surrounding?

Could one theoretically manipulate such a gas in a meaningful way with magnets? I.e. if gas was placed in a hermetically sealed cylinder with some spinning magnets at the top and bottom, or on the sides or whatever, could you create a predictable vortex / any predictable fluid flow within the tube? Assuming you find some smart person to piece out all the complicated math of spinning magnetic fields and fluids etc.

What's the limiting technology for this?

Text: To move something in space we have to generate thrust right? So to do that something has to be ejected in the opposite direction? Like gas or jet exhaust? 

Old school cathode ray tubes TVs shoot an electron beam, in a vacuum, guided by magnets at a phosphorescent material. These electrons then excite the pixels and produces photons. 

So assuming we cut off the display end of a tv and attached it to an item in space could the electron beam be able to move said object. 

Electrons are basically massless but if we had enough being shot out would the cumulative effect be enough to generate thrust in the opposite direction?

I’m not high I’m just not knowledgeable enough to figure it out.

Edit: Hi all, thank you for the replies. The bit about the + charge affecting the “spacecraft” and attracting what negatively charged particles may be in the vicinity, after a while, I hadn’t thought about. Makes total sense of course, additionally I had no idea ION thrusters were a thing. Lots to read up on.

Text: From my understanding, a photon is essentially a self-propagating oscillation in the electromagnetic field, with the electric and magnetic components out of phase with each-other by 90 degrees. Due to the way in which a changing magnetic field induces an electric field and vice-versa, this combined oscillation ends up propagating through space at the speed of light.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is: Do Gluons, W and Z bosons and the Higgs boson propagate via similar methods to the photon but just using different fields, or is their method of propagation completely different? The other types of bosons feel so mysterious to me in comparison to photons, so I'd love to learn more about how they work

Text: From my very basic understanding so far, we had some bacterias in the warm ocean enjoying yummy photosynthesis and gasses, kinda screwed themselves over with that for a few years, but bounced back for the second half. I'm wondering how or why did they become multi-cellular and what could've been the first organisms we could actually see (with our own eyes not a microscope) mostly before the proterozoic period? I'd say we have some examples today, but I'm gonna assume our bacterias had their own evolution through time also.


Side rant- I wish we could've just stayed in the warm primordial soup so we don't have to pay taxes, but noo, we just had to enjoy land 🙄

(I'm still heavily learning but my new hyper fixation is learning about the earliest life, and for obvious reasons it's kinda hard to research something so long ago. And most of my knowledge is being built by small easy to follow informational vids on YouTube, like PBS Eons is one of my faves for example. But most stuff would be on prehistoric animal lines we could follow from today.) 

If you have any interesting videos or creators to share please let me know! I do have the attention span of a mentally set back squirrel but this is also something I'm very interested in, not just this but all prehistoric biology. I use TikTok and other social media's too so not just YouTube!

Text: For example, why do some types of cancer account for the majority of cases while others are rare? What is stopping more people from getting those rare cancers more often? I know environmental influences + cell type + other genes/genetic predispositions are definitely big factors, but it almost feels like a paradox to just call all mutations random, even though I know that to be true. 

To clarify, I'm not trying to challenge the idea that genetic mutations are random, I'm just trying to understand the framework, especially in the broader context of evolution.



Edit: Thanks everyone who's responded! This has pointed me in the direction of thinking more along the lines of distribution of cancers + mutations in general in different types of cells + in specific genes and considering the complex environmental causes/risk factors (?) of cell mutations, which feels more comprehensive and like I'm on the right track. I feel like I may need to go more in depth to understand this in the broad context of genetics + evolution, so I might have to look for some good (maybe basic, for now) reading materials or something.

I've often heard the ability for organisms to grow to such sizes is correlated with higher concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere, is this accurate? And beyond that, for organisms that grew to be so massive, did they simply contain a larger number of cells not much different from the animal and plant cells we see today (granted there's variation within those categories), or were individual cells also larger themselves? Perhaps the surface area to volume ratio could have differed based on oxygen availability and thus enhanced cell transport?

Text: Some breeders cross a dog and a wolf to create a wolf-dog. That make me thinking, over the thousands of years we bred dogs, there must have been countless occurrences of cross breeding between the two. I wonder if we know the amount of genes and DNA sequences that evolved among dogs that spread into the wolf population ? I saw some people adopting a wolf as a pet, I am under the impression that a wolf from 100 000 year ago would not have been tamed so easily.

Text: ~background info~

I've found an interesting series of videos that talk about humongous structures in space like the dyson sphere. One of these structures is called the shkadov thruster which is capable of accelerating stars. The actual acceleration is very slow and would take billions of years to get any decent velocity out of it, but the concept is fascinating - taking billions of years, untold resources and a star to make the biggest bomb in history.

So I'm curious, what would it actually do if it hit something? I'm fairly certain everything in the size of the solar system would be basically gone. So would this annihilate some significant portion of the galaxy?

Millions and millions of gallons are used DAILY, which surely can’t be sustainable long-term. Especially so with the population now reaching 8 billion and climbing. Is there actually a plan in place or is the “doomsday” so far out that it’s actually not a cause of concern for those in power?

I got here thinking about what the night sky would look like for a species that developed, completely implausibly but not technically impossibly, early in the lifetime of our universe. I don't even know when that'd be, but just for example, would someone looking up on an Earth-like planet in a random galaxy 4, 5, 6 billion years ago see more things because fewer things were seriously redshifted? If not, is it a matter of those numbers are too small or it would never amount to a noticeable difference? Would local (intragalactic) contributions be a much bigger variable anyway?

Basically, I would like to see some data on the infection rates of Flu and RSV between cohorts that recieved an mRNA vaccine for covid and those that did not. Ideally peer reviewed sources, but pre-order review could suffice (I can follow along until the paper is published). It may also be the case that it is too early in the flu season for such research to have been conducted, so I would also be interested in any ongoing studies. Lastly, I'm interested to learn about the methodology used to find these studies.

As I know COVID can be contentious, my agenda is to accrue compelling evidence to disprove my family member's assertions that rising flu and RSV infections are caused by &quot;the clot shot&quot;.

For transparency, I am double vaxxed and boosted, with another booster on the the way.

If I stand in place, and do a 360 rotation, I'm spinning in place. But once we interpret it as, instead, the world revolving around me, it becomes a problem. Distant galaxies, following that wide arc, have traversed billions of lightyears a second, relative to my rotation. Just centripetal force alone should reduce them to dust. 

So how does relativity of motion reconcile with things rotating?

Text: Both online and in my physics courses I’ve seen two seemingly very different accounts for pressure in a fluid at hydrostatic equilibrium:

· The first posits that pressure is a macroscopic measure of the impacts of fluid particles on a surface submerged in the fluid. It is therefore a function of the temperature of the fluid and its density.

· The second explains pressure by the weight of the volume of fluid above each point. It therefore depends on its density and the depth in the fluid (or the altitude in the case of the atmosphere).

I can’t figure out how the two are related. The first explanation requires no gravity, while the second would imply zero pressure in a zero g environment. What am I missing? Is the first explanation only valid for gases and not liquids? And if so, why?

And on that note, I would also like to ask how the second explanation accounts for pressure being a scalar and not a vector: if it is merely the reaction force which balances the weight of the fluid above (per unit area), then why is it the same along axes perpendicular to the vertical?

Text: There's lots in the news about antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and I'm trying to get a more nuanced understanding of how bacteria develop resistance, and if they ever lose that resistance over time.  I know that, in the world of genetically engineered bacteria, it's hard to keep a trait stable over many generations of bacteria.  If the trait isn't necessary for the bacteria's survival, it often mutates away.  Genetic engineers often tie interesting traits to a separate trait for bacterial resistance, and then expose the bacteria to antibiotics to select (in theory) for just the bacteria that have an intact version of the special trait and the associated resistance.

I'm curious about what happens if you take a bacteria strain, like MRSA, that has evolved a resistance to drugs in the methicillin family, and then culture it in an environment where it's not exposed to any antibiotics.  Does the bacteria lose the resistance over generations?  How long does it take?  If the culture loses resistance over time, and then you expose the culture to methicillin again, does the culture re-gain resistance faster, than, say, a naive strain of S. aureus that's never developed resistance in the first place?  Is inherited resistance forever, or does it require continued exposure to antibiotics to maintain that resistance?  

Also, got any recommendations for good books about bacterial resistance?

Text: We   all know the benefits of masks in reducing the number of respiratory   infections, and that fact was reinforced during the pandemic. Many of us   are still wearing masks in our daily lives and have successfully   avoided not only corona infections but other respiratory infections as   well.

On the other hand, not   getting infected with respiratory viruses also means that our immunity   wanes over time. We know that roughly half of the population of people   who live in isolated tribes die when they contract a respiratory virus   after contact with a modern human, because they lack immunity.

Could masks contribute to a waned immunity and therefore have a negative effect on population health in the long term?

Text: A quick search shows that a 2 month old baby can see around 12 inches away. What happens when they look at a mirror within that range? Can they see things across the room clearly, because the mirror itself is less than a foot away? Do things in the mirror look just as blurry as they would normally, since the object in the mirror is more than a foot away?

I noticed while changing my kid's diaper that he would stare really intently into the mirror on the wall just above the changing table. Sometimes it seemed like he was accurately tracking my wife moving around the room - through the mirror - even though she was way outside the normal limit of his vision. It could be that he was just tracking a sort of blobby movement (which he does a lot of anyway.) But his level of interest in the mirror is really intense.

(To add, because the mirror is so close and above him, I think he's able to see a lot of the room well, but not much of himself. I don't *think* he's just fascinated by his reflection, but that is obviously another real possibility)

-why aren't vax shots done in the veins and arteries? Why the arm muscle? If it's in the vein, wouldn't that carry the &quot;product&quot; around faster?

-is the muscle and everything just mass covered with veins so that chances are the needles hit the veins anyways? 

-why are vaxes via needles and not tablets like antibiotics? 

-if the vax/needle is put in the arm/muscle, how does that product move around the body? Does our immune system just update our OS with the new info and its filed away?

-why the arm soreness? Is it because a needle pierced the muscle? If so, wouldn't that pain happen right away like stubbing a toe? Or does the arm hurt from the product? And why?

Hope these questions actually made sense! And thanks in advance!

Text:  I was doing some reading about Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome and I noticed this site and a number of others say “The current diagnostic criteria for POTS is a heart rate increase \[…\], within the first 10 minutes of standing, in the **absence of orthostatic hypotension**.”(emphasis mine): [http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/page.php?ID=30](http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/page.php?ID=30)

However other sources I’ve read talk about orthostatic hypotension as one of the common symptoms of POTS, so I’m confused by this contradiction.

For example:

“Significant initial orthostatic hypotension (IOH) occurs in \~50% of postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) patients and 13% of controls. Heart rate and blood pressure recovery are prolonged in IOH sustaining lightheadedness; IOH is more prevalent and severe in POTS.”  
[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32702262/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32702262/)

”Symptoms include fast heart rate coupled with low blood pressure”

[https://www.ehlers-danlos.org/what-is-eds/information-on-eds/postural-tachycardia-syndrome-pots/](https://www.ehlers-danlos.org/what-is-eds/information-on-eds/postural-tachycardia-syndrome-pots/)  


Can someone clarify for me why this diagnostic criteria seems to conflict across so many sources? 

Is it a lack of consensus in the medical community? A change in what is known about the condition rendering old criteria outdated? Or do different types/causes of POTS manifest differently? I did notice low bp/orthostatic hypotension most often seemed to be mentioned as a symptom in the context of POTS cases associated with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and MCAS (which is itself often associated with EDS).

Text: Wheat was the food staple of Europeans for most of history, and its been only recently (about the last 2 generations) that so many of us suddenly seem unable to process it properly. What in our biological make-up could be causing this sudden rise in intolerance of a once critical food? Have there been any studies pointing to a cause? Can we reverse it / fix it?

Text: I'm an astrophysicist at the City University of New York and American Museum of Natural History, I'm also host and writer of PBS Space Time, and am working on a new film project called Inventing Reality!

Ask me anything about:

PBS Space Time! We've now been making this show for 7 years (!!!!) and have covered a LOT of physics and astrophysics. We also have big plans for the future of the show. AMA about anything Space Time.

The new astrophysics program I'm working on that will (hopefully!) map the region around 100's of supermassive black holes at Event Horizon Telescope resolution, using gravitational lensing, machine learning, and the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time. A &quot;side benefit&quot; of the project is that we may help resolve the crisis in cosmology with an independent measurement of the expansion history of the universe. AMA about black holes, quasars, lensing, cosmology, ML in astro LSST, and how we hope to bring it all together.

And finally, with some of my Space Time colleagues I'm working on a new feature-length documentary called Inventing Reality, in which I'll explore humanity's grand quest for the fundamental. It'll include a survey of our best scientific understanding of what Reality really is; but equally importantly, it'll be an investigation of the question itself, and what the answers mean for how we think about ourselves. AMA about reality! And the film, if you like. Ps. we're trying to fund it, just sayin': [www.indiegogo.com/projects/inventing-reality](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/inventing-reality)

Text: I have read a lot and heard a lot about dark energy and dark matter being required to explain why galaxys are possible to exist without flying apart.

What i never see explained is:

Is each star within a galaxy assumed to be a point mass? Or do we see each star as a 3D object that has gravity that disipates from its own centre of mass and is less at its surface and progressively less effect as distance increases (to infinity)?

Do we &quot;simply&quot; count the stars, and their mass, and get that as the mass of the galaxy, and then based on its size, work out if it should be capable of staying together? Or do we model the individual stars and their gravity?

If we do model the individual stars, do we model their cumulative gravity to infinity too?

&amp;#x200B;

Short of reading research papers (which go waaaay over my head), none of the above is ever really explained on any documentary (traditional tv or youtube or podcast) that i have seen. Could somebody give me an idea of any of this?

There is a clear mental picture of what 10 squared is, 100 of course, but 10 multiplied by itself 1.397... times fits awkwardly into my mind.

I am interested in the way we conceive and use these notions. Logarithms work but 10\^1.39 has no meaning.

Is there some, maybe mystical, way of thinking about these things where they become meaningful?

2. You have a closed tight syringe-like tube with a piston inside, in &quot;compressed&quot; state (occupying low volume), underwater. Inside the tube, there is a small electric engine (powered by a battery) connected to the piston. The weight of the whole system is very low. Starting the engine (i.e. remote controlled) will push the piston towards outside (increasing the volume). Will the tube start floating if enough delta-volume is made by the movement of the piston?

Text: The holiday season can be painful enough without suffering from physical agony, so we're here to answer questions you may have about pain and pain relief.

More than 20% of Americans endure chronic pain - pain that lingers for three months or more. While pharmaceuticals can be helpful, particularly for short-term pain, they often fail to help chronic pain - sometimes even making it worse. And many people who struggle with opioid addiction started down that path because to address physical discomfort.

Join us today at 3 PM ET (20 UT) for a discussion about pain and pain relief, organized by USA TODAY, which recently ran a 5-part series on the subject. We'll answer your questions about what pain is good for, why pain often sticks around and what you can do to cope with it. Ask us anything!

Text: So from my memory of thermodynamics, an ideal heat pump is the carnot cycle. This cycle uses an ideal gas on both the hot and cold sides of the pump. However in the real world we use the refridgeration cycle with an evaporator and a compressor.

I understand that the Carnot cycle is 'ideal' and therefore we can't get to Carnot efficiencies in real life.

But what real life factor means we can't try and use a gas both sides (with a turbine to replace the evaporator? Is it energy density? Cost? Complexity? Do space/military grade heat pumps with high performance requirements do something different?

Thanks!

Edit: just a quick edit to say thanks so much for all the responses so far, it's exactly the sort of detailed science and real world experience I wanted to understand and get a feeling for. I will try and respond to everyone shortly!

Edit2: bonus question and I think some commenters have already hinted at this: flip the question, what would it take / what would it look like to have an all-gas cycle and if money were no object could it outperform a phase change cycle? I'm assuming extremely high pressure nitrogen as the working fluid to achieve a good energy density... Enormous heat exchangers. Could it get closer to Carnot COPs?

Text: In discussions of fusion research online, I keep finding statements that the preferred fusion fuel is a combination of Deuterium and Tritium.  Deuterium is readily available in nature, but the Tritium has to be manufactured.  The commonly stated scheme is to bombard Lithium-6 with neutrons from the fusion reaction, which will (usually?) cause the Lithium-6 nucleus to split into Tritium plus an alpha particle.  What I can't understand is how this can produce enough Tritium to maintain fusion.  One D-T fusion reaction produces one neutron, and one neutron causes one Lithium-6 nucleus to produce a Tritium ion -- for this to work, it seems we are requiring perfect 100% efficiency of fusion neutrons producing Lithium fuel.  My engineering background refuses to believe it. 100% efficiency is a fantasy, some of those fusion neutrons are going to escape the Lithium blanket without reacting, and some will get involved in reactions that don't produce Tritium.  Thus the fuel cycle I keep seeing described can't possibly produce enough Tritium to keep fusion going indefinitely.  Is there some mechanism I haven't run across that produces extra Tritium or extra neutrons somehow?

The only answers I was able to produce while searching related to what happens to our bodies in space or on different planets, and that our skin doesn't &quot;breathe&quot;, but still absorbs oxygen. 

So just as an extreme example, if we were to find another planet with the same pressure and composition as ours but lacking oxygen, or if our own somehow ran out of oxygen, would there be a limit to how long we could stay outside without a suit, aside from the oxygen required to breathe?

Or in other words, what would happen to our bodies if the respiratory system was the only part of us that had access to oxygen (most of the time)?

I was wondering what the undergoing mechanism/reason is behind that upper limit. 

Is there a cut off after which it can’t be metabolized properly or will it put unnecessary strain on the liver/kidneys ?
I’m aware that a possible danger would be elevated blood pressure due to osmolarity I think ?

Would love some links to papers/articles/book suggestions regarding this as well if some can be provided.

So recently when cooking I had placed cut potatoes into water to prevent oxidation and when I poured off the potatoes a small amount of water+starch was left in my stainless steel bowl. Where the water spread out and started drying it looked like the starch was shimmering, it did not happen in the more water rich slurries or when completely dry.

What's going on? Are there starch crystals falling out and refracting the light?

My question is, how confident are we in the Lambda-CDM model? As physicists continue to work on this stuff and improve and modify the model, is the estimated age likely to change? And if so, how dramatically?

I.e., how certain are we that the Big Bang did not actually happen 14 billion years ago and that the Lambda-CDM model is just slightly off?

Would the patient require to solely transplant the eyeball or would any nerves, like the optic nerve have to be transplanted too?

A follow-up question; In the TV series Babylon 5, a doctor is able to implant an artificial eye into a patient. The patient would see via a camera that transmitted to the optic nerve (IIRC). I don't recall if the eye-ball was artificially grown or not.

Funny enough the eyeball transmitter has some range so the eye could be ehm.. forgotten somewhere..for a while.

It sounds to me like altering the genetic structure of an organism by either removing or introducing DNA, or modifying existing genetic material in situ would go against natural selection, assuming a genetic error isn't being corrected, would it not?

I would think artificial selection also isn't necessarily biomimetic, given the role natural selection plays in biomimicry, correct?

Text: Under Radiative Transfer Theory, does a water vapor molecule in the atmosphere release infrared radiation (spontaneous emission) in all directions (isotropically), or in a specific direction (anisotropically)?

Also, I understand that the release is &quot;spontaneous&quot; or &quot;random&quot;. Does &quot;spontaneous/random&quot; relate to both timing and vector of photon emission, or just one of the two?

Thanks for any insights you can provide.

Text: This is an idea I was curious about for a while, I'll give an example to further clarify what I mean

Let's say that we have a group of say, 500 individuals with a certain genetic disorder, for example short sightedness
Wouldn't it be possible to sequence their genes to find the ones they all have in common in order to get a cure?,  this obviously can also apply to any other mental or physical disorder

I know that it's much more complex than that and that several genes can cause the same problem, and it can also be created due to 2 or 3 unrelated genes clashing together, but the main question is if this method is feasible as a solution


Let's expand it further and say that we have sequenced more than a million individuals, would it be possible to average that in order to get an average human?

Text: I am Shimon Rachmilevitch, a plant ecophysiologist at the Institute for Agriculture and Biotechnology within the Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research at Ben Gurion University of the Negev since 2007. I completed my B.Sc. in Biology, and then continued to complete my M.Sc. and Ph.D. in plant sciences, all degrees at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. I carried out post-doctoral research at University of California Davis and Rutgers University and spent three years as a visiting professor at Harvard and Cornell universities. I published over 100 peer reviewed studies and supervised over 50 students and post docs from all over the world, of which most have continued either in academic or industrial research.

The overall goal of my research is to explore adaptation and acclimation mechanisms of plants to the desert environment in both natural and agricultural vegetation. Understanding tolerance mechanisms of plants grown in desert environments is invaluable for increasing the genetic pool of tolerant plants for agriculture and for maintaining biodiversity in natural ecosystems. A focus of this research is the root system and the interaction between roots and shoots that enable plants to prosper in drylands. The lab takes advantage of its location in the desert and studies the surrounding natural and agricultural ecosystems. I collaborate with many researchers and receive research grants from different foundations, including the Israeli Science Foundation, BARD, and Ministry of Agriculture. In the last six years I managed the &quot;Root of the Matter&quot; knowledge center. I also collaborate with the agritech industry including Baier, Evogene, Netafim and Syngenta.
I serve as the head of the Israeli Society for Plant Sciences and the Mirilashvili Center for Food Security in the Desert, and am the chair of the DDD - Desert, Dryland and Desertification international conference in collaboration with the UN, which in its last conference, hosted over 800 scientists from more than 50 different countries.

You are welcome to learn more about my lab: https://rachmilevitchlab.weebly.com/

Text: Each generation back, the number of individuals doubles (two parents, four grandparents, etc.), but eventually, the same individuals start to appear in multiple parts of your family tree, since otherwise you’d be exceeding the population of the world. So the number of unique individuals in each generation grows at first before eventually shrinking. How many unique individuals can we expect in the ‘widest’ generation?

Edit: I’ve found the topic of [pedigree collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedigree_collapse), which is relevant to my question.

Edit 2: [Here's](https://www.straightdope.com/21341588/2-4-8-16-how-can-you-always-have-more-ancestors-as-you-go-back-in-time) an old blog post which provides one example of an answer. For a typical English child born in 1947, &quot;the maximum number of “real” ancestors occurs around 1200 AD — 2 million, some 80 percent of the population of England.&quot; [Here's](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/01/your-family-past-present-and-future.html) another post that delves into the concept more.

Similarly, during the time I lived in student residence, outbreaks of it were common (and fleeting). People are usually quite sick for just a day or two in the typical dramatic noro fashion, and then become asymptomatic. 


Most other diseases' symptomatic periods tend to last about a week or more - like a cold, or some common flu, or even covid-19. Why is norovirus so quick, in comparison? Is this something to do with the nature of it infecting the GI as opposed to the respritory tract?

Or, if they did, I didn't understand it. 

I infer that the presence of the string tells the attacking virus &quot;I've already been infected&quot; and so it leaves it alone. I'm anthropomorphizing, but not sure the better way to describe it. Am I correct? Or is there more going on here?

I saw some picture of a doctor and nurses sitting on the floor in exhaustion after a 36 hour life-saving surgery (or so the post claimed). 

.

I then found myself wondering - how do the shifts work in such a procedure? Surely it wasn't the same staff for 36 hours, right? Is there an overlap where a second team takes over and is fully briefed over an hour or more, or what?
If the scope of the operation is uncertain, how are the shifts designed?

.

In my mind this is a scientific question about procedures in the field of medical science. I hope you agree and that someone can offer some valuable insight.

Text: Hey folks.

Please correct me if I have any assumptions wrong. I have read articles about fusion and the time line of main sequence (?) stars. And so many times I have read that once a star starts producing iron, it is a dying star. From what I understand, the energy from fusing iron into heavier elements takes more energy than it gives out. For sure, a lot of the language I read is seemingly overly dramatic. I'm hoping that I can get some more precise information, on two points.

1. This is different from larger stars, correct?
2. What is the time frame for this 'iron death'? I would never assume that a star suddenly goes dark of course, I mean, it's laughable, if I can be funny for a second, the any iron in a main sequence star would kill it. As in, catapulting an anvil Wiley Coyote style will put out a star.

My assumption as that the H to He fusion and so on continues, for billions of years? I hope someone who knows these things can clarify the timeline for me. And thanks!

How does the net number of prides increase and how do lions (re)colonize new territories?

Do large prides occasionally split up? Or may wandering males link up with females that have left their pride for one reason or another, similar to what wolves do?

Any biologists, ecologists or zoologists here that know the facts on this? Are there any solid sources on this? When I look around online all I find is the same information about males taking over prides, which makes me want to find the answer even more.

I appreciate anyone who can help me scratch this itch.

Text: Some context: 

Where I live in NH, the average historical daily temp continues to drop after the Winter Solstice (December 21 this year) and doesn't level off and start getting warmer until about mid-January. Why is that?   


Additionally, the average temperature climbs slower from Winter into Spring than it drops from Fall into Winter. What's going on there?   


Based on my naïve understanding, I'd expect the temperature to be relatively symmetrical around the Solstice (Solstice - 1 roughly = to Solstice + 1, etc), but that's clearly not the case. 

Can someone help explain this to a weather newbie?

I know that neurogenesis is somewhat debated but I couldn't find answers as to whether neurons naturally died without an external factor such as injury, disease, or the like.

If they do naturally die of old age what's a neuron's life expectancy?

If they don't then how long do they life on average before degenerative diseases or the like kill them?

Are you really doing children a big favor by having them play these types of games? I recall them being used during my Computer classes as well. (only there though) Other schools might use them even more frequently.

Text: I was reading this paper (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10717540801905124) and I was wondering about this part below and I had a few questions.

“Synthesis of Aminated Gelatin

Aminated gelatin was synthesized by the reaction of native cationic gelatin with 1, 2-ethylenediamine (Wang et al. 2000). Briefly, native cationic gelatin was dissolved in phosphate buffer (pH 5.3), and 1, 2-ethylenediamine, was added under stirring. After adjusting the pH to 5.0 with 5 M HCl, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride was added. The final concentrations of native gelatin, ethylenediamine, and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride in the resultant solution were 20, 56, and 10.7 mg/mL, respectively. The resultant solution was incubated at 37°C for 18 hr, followed by dialysis against purified water for 48 hr, and then freeze-dried to obtain the aminated gelatin. The numbers of primary amino groups introduced into the native cationic and aminated gelatin were measured by the TNBS method (Snyder and Sobocinski 1975). The amino group contents of the native cationic gelatin and aminated gelatin were 0.33 and 0.64 mmol/g, respectively.

Preparation of Gelatin Microspheres

NGMS and CGMS were prepared by glutaraldehyde cross-linking in the dispersed state of an aqueous gelatin solution in the oil phase by a modification of the method of Tabata and Ikada (1989). Briefly, 1 mL native cationic or aminated gelatin aqueous solution (10 wt%, preheated to 40°C) was added dropwise to 25 mL olive oil and then emulsified by vortex-mixing to yield a water-in-oil emulsion. The emulsion temperature was dropped to 4°C, then 7.5 mL cold acetone was added to the emulsion and stirring was continued for 1 hr to induce gel formation. The resulting microspheres were collected by centrifugation (2500× g, 4°C, 5 min) and washed three times with acetone. The cross-linking of the microspheres was carried out using 0.06% glutaraldehyde in acetone/0.01 M HCl solution (7:3) at 4°C for the indicated time. Following collection by centrifugation (2500× g, 4°C, 5 min), the microspheres were agitated in 10 mM aqueous glycine solution at room temperature for 1 hr to block the residual aldehyde groups of the unreacted glutaraldehyde. The resulting microspheres were finally washed three times with purified water by centrifugation and then freeze-dried.”

From Millipore Sigma’s website “Physical Properties: Type A gelatin has 78-80 millimoles of free carboxyl groups per 100 g of protein and a pI of 7.0-9.5.”

What does it mean when there’s a range for the isoelectric point? Does it mean that using the procedure from the paper, it can increase type A gelatin’ s isoelectric point to be closer to 9.5? From the second paragraph, are microspheres just powders? Would it be soluble in water? Lastly, is an isoelectric point the same as a pH point of zero charge? Thanks so much!

Text: (Unsure if best place to ask/best flair, thank you for your time.)

I obtained a scald injury on my hand recently, and have been researching radiation casually. I experience flares of pain on the scald area whenever I accidentally warm the skin up, such as proximity to warm skin or hot mugs, etc. Naturally, on the flip side, cold = good.

It got me wondering: could a radiation burn feel similarly? I know about sun exposure increasing pain for some radiation burns, but I don't know about warmth-related pain, since it's UV that causes the sunlight pain.

I couldn't find an answer by Googling, and my guess is no they don't (except from burns from thermal radiation) but I have no reason to think that, I guess. A burn is a burn, right? Or are radiation burns fundamentally different in some way?

Text: Was in a discussion about radiometric dating, and someone suggested this paper: http://library.sciencemadness.org/lanl1_a/lib-www/pubs/00285784.pdf

They claimed the paper shows how radiometric dating is unreliable, because radioisotopes can be leeched or absorbed which would through off the ratio of daughter to parent isotope.

In practice, I’m sure scientists wouldn’t excavate samples anywhere near known nuclear tests sites or radioactive waste. I also know we have isochron methods to help identify contamination, but does anyone know how this is actually practiced? 

How do we account for this type of contamination or does the paper have any real implications on radiometric dating?

Thank you
