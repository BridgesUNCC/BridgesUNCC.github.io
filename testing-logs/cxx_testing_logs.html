Title: Is the Flynn effect still going?

Text:  The way I understand the causes for the Flynn effect are as follows:

1. Malnutrition and illness can stunt the IQ of a growing child. These have been on the decline in most of the world for the last century.
2. Education raises IQ. Public education is more ubiquitous than ever, hence the higher IQs today.
3. Reduction in use of harmful substances such as lead pipes.

Has this effect petered out in the developed world, or is it still going strong? Is it really an increase in everyone's IQ's or are there just less malnourished, illiterate people in the world (in other words are the rich today smarter than the rich of yesterday)?

What was it about conditions on Earth at the time that made such immensity a viable adaptation?  Hypothetically, could such an adaptation emerge again under current/future conditions?

Text: I've been watching documentaries released \~7 years ago about food waste in America. They criticized companies like Walmart for throwing out their leftover food rather than donating it or selling it at a discount. They said that when food is in landfills it produces methane, but if you compost it then it  won't. 

So my question is: Could someone explain why one form of decomposition results in methane production but another does not? Are there other differences?

Text: I’m currently working on my Masters thesis in the area of atomic filters for solar atmospheric observation. It’s known that there are elements at varying heights in the solar atmosphere, such as sodium and calcium, but why? I presume it’s from previous supernova explosions, which accrued in the solar atmosphere, but do we also know why they are at a particular height. For example neutral Ca is at about 1000 km above the solar surface in the chromosphere. Is there a particular reason for that height or is it random? Long post but appreciate any information!

Text: I have seen this animation on how the thousands of satellite revolved around the earth, and it led me to wonder about Saturn. Saturn has these rings, and how in the world does it look like that? I have also seen this j1407b who has lots of rings.

So, what causes the rings on planets, and how did they form? How do they have different layers, and how do they separate?

Thanks for any explanation.

Text: What is the mathematical principle which helps any organism (like a tree or fungus) decide the general spacing between the branches originating from the main stem? The older the branches are, the further apart they will be due to extension (i think), so is it a logarithmic growth? Does the theoretical maximum length of the branch decided how further apart they will originate from the main stem? Is this length coded in the genetics of that species?

Text: I have seen this animation on how the thousands of satellite revolved around the earth, and it led me to wonder about Saturn. Saturn has these rings, and how in the world does it look like that? I have also seen this j1407b who has lots of rings.

So, what causes the rings on planets, and how did they form? How do they have different layers, and how do they separate?

Thanks for any explanation.

The older the branches are, the further apart they will be due to extension (i think), so is it a logarithmic growth? Does the theoretical maximum length of the branch decided how further apart they will originate from the main stem? Is this length coded in the genetics of that species?

Text: We were taught in elementary school that the reason gas is amorphous is because the molecules are really spread apart. The reason solids are hard and can’t be moved through is because the molecules are packed together. 

We’ve all heard that 99% of an atom is just empty space, and atoms make up molecules. 

So with all that empty space, what’s stopping the molecules from getting closer together?

Additionally, as something gets colder, it’s volume shrinks. Hot air will rise above cold air. We were also told that was because the molecules are moving faster. So theoretically, a molecule can reach absolute cold and be able to be packed right up next to another molecule, without that 99% of space, right?

If I understand it correctly, blue-footed booby nests look nothing like the bowl-shaped stick nest shown in the animation but instead consist of a few little sticks lying on the ground and a scrape, surrounded by excrement. So there's not really anything to tear down, and it wouldn't make any sense to do so either.

I even tried contacting Big Word Club, asking how that claim ended up in the video, but I haven't gotten an answer. I know, I don't have care this much, but I would like to be absolutely certain.

If a bakery buys a cellphone to handle incoming calls, is the cellphone a final good? I imagine the bakery is the final user of the cellphone. Yet the cellphone seems to be part of the bakery's inputs, so I'm hesitant to say yes.

Ex. If you had a laser, could you shine it at the sun and then see that laser on the other side of the sun? (Let's assume the observer on the other side of the sun can differentiate between light from the sun and light from the laser.)

Similarly for other forces like the electric attraction between an electron and proton seems to reduce the phase-space of their joint spatial configurations which seems to reduce entropy?

How do we reconcile the fundamental forces with the second law that entropy always increases?

Text: Filariasis or Elephantiasis is a human disease caused by the nematode parasite Wuchereria bancrofti. The adult parasite gives birth to a microfilaria from the lymphatic system. The worm then goes into the human's circulatory system, gets sucked by a mosquito, develops until it is reintroduced to another human host and develop into adults in the lymphatic system. Thus its cycle. I have heard that the mosquito is a necessary step in the cycle, but I don't see why other than it being the transmission vector. Is there another reason the parasite has to go through the mosquito in order for it to develop? Do mosquitoes contribute to the nematode's development? What are the differences between the filaria larvae before it has been ingested by the mosquito and after it has been injected into the human host?

What is the blue pigment in them? like the chemical formula and all that.

Other blue pigments include the blue blood of mollusks and crustaceans due to copper instead of iron but vertebrates have red blood so that's not it.

Another way blue chemicals form is by combining a pigment of a different color and a protein like the blue lobster or the blue starfish but I didn't read anywhere that this fish does it like that.

Text: &gt;Wheeler,(1958). Scientific Glassblowing, Interscience Publishers, New York &amp; London. Chapter IV Basic Operations, Page 56. &quot;Milligan has found that the strength of glass containing cracks is greatly influenced by a liquid in contact with the surface of the glass. Exposure of the surface to air saturated with alcohol or water greatly reduces the strength. Putting a drop of water on the crack reduces the strength by about 20% whereas moistening the crack with dry paraffin oil strengthens the tube by about 20%. Milligan does not advance an explanation for either of these effects, but many glassblowers can attest to the accuracy of the statement that water in the scratch reduces the strength of the glass tubing&quot;.

To cut glass, a cutting tool is used to make a scored line, then the glass is tapped or torqued and the stress concentration at the scratch causes the glass to break along the desired line.

Glassblowers always suggest wetting the scored mark to make the break easier, cleaner, and more reliable. Why does this work?

[Here is a video of the phenomenon.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEAxhMECluM)

[Here is a paywalled article that I can't read.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-fracturing-of-glass/)

Text: Most pet owners probably give their dog/cat some monthly dose of oral/topical medicine that aims to kill parasitic organisms before they are able to transmit disease. Why is this not a viable option for humans as well? It seems our options are confined to deet and permethrin as the only viable solutions which are generally one-use treatments.

Text: I am aware of how they are made (at least as much as a layman art major can be) and how they differ from subunit or inactivated vaccines, however I am trying to better understand the physical creation part of the process.

What machine is used to process the proteins? What skills are needed to even use them?

The closest I got was to find a manufacturer of lab equipment (Microfluidics), but they list the machines as their model number (I'm assuming) and not their name which, even if I knew, I don't know which ones are or are not needed for recombinant vaccines specifically.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

Text: The textbook answer I seem to find everywhere is that they are a way to **represent** field strength and direction, they flow from north to south and the strength of the magnetic field is represented by the density of the lines in a given area. Sure, that makes sense.

However, my question arises when I physically see lines of flux when I scatter iron filings around a magnet. Surely these are not just a representation but a physical reality. In other words, if they were \*just\* a representation, we wouldn't observe them in the exact same way in physical reality, just as you would never be able to &quot;see&quot; the sine wave representing pressure changes moving through the air when describing sound, because that is not what is physically happening.

I'm curious why everything I can find says that they are merely a representation, and yet we can physically see lines forming from iron filings. What's going on there?

Edit: thank you for the excellent answers everyone! All these answers have collectively helped a lot.

Text: The reasoning behind my question is based on the idea that charge is compressible.

Water is often used to describe electric current but it seems like gas is more fitting.

Say you had two parcels of air with differing parts per million of some particulate but same volume.(let's say they are in balloons to prevent dissipation)

both could be traveling the same speed relative to the ground although the parts per second would be higher for the higher ppm parcel.

Higher voltage is a higher ratio of joules per coulomb

Higher current is more coulombs per second

Higher Power is more joules per second

Am I right in thinking more energy per charge and more charge per second is achieved through higher charge density rather than electrons moving faster though space?

Text: let's say i have an open circuit with a 5V voltage source, with the positive terminal connected to node A and the negative terminal connected to node B (which are not connected to anything, hence an open circuit).

If take B as a reference point, A should have a potential of 5V.

let's say I have a 2 ohm resistor connected between the positive terminal and A.

The circuit is open, there is no voltage drop across this resistor, hence A still has a potential of 5V.

if I connect a current source across that resistor, say 5A, then ohm's law tells us that the resistor has a voltage drop of 10V.

What i want to know is that does A now have a potential of 5V-10V = -5V? does the voltage drop across the resistor caused by the current cause the potential of the battery's positive terminal to drop across the resistor?

I chose an open circuit as an example, to make the calculation easy, but if the circuit were closed, would this voltage drop in resistor caused by the current source ADD to the voltage drop in the resistor caused by the current flowing in the main, voltage source loop?

Text: I analyzed recent scientific articles on the effect of parental age on the probability of producing a healthy kid: https://empirical-wonderland.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-effect-of-parental-age-on.html

However, I am not a biologist or a doctor myself. If anybody is also interested in this topic or has more knowledge on the subject, please have a look at my summary and let me know if you find any errors or disagree with me. Any comments are appreciated.

In a nutshell, I found that the probability of a woman getting pregnant in one year of trying (sex every 3 days) drops from 86% (at 20 years old) to 53% (at 40 years old). The probability of miscarriage also increases from 10% to 25%, while the probability of a birth defect rises from 1% to 15%, with an acceleration in this trend after the age of 40.

For men, the effects of age were less pronounced. The probability of making a woman pregnant within a year decreases by approximately 10% after the age of 40, compared to the age of 30. However, older men also tend to have less sex than younger ones. After 40, men increase the probability of miscarriage by 1.23 times (how I understood, it increases from 10% to 12% for a partner in her 20s, but this could be wrong) compared to 25-29. Finally, advanced paternal age has a significant positive effect on the rate of birth defects. However, the rate is generally low. For example, orofacial clefts have a probability lower than 0.2%. For fathers over 45, this probability is up to 0.3%.

Text: I understand that as vessels age, the endothelium becomes less responsive to various chemical signals, including nitric oxide.  What I don't understand is why this happens .... is it because of an increase in the number of senescent cells in the endothelium?  Have I got this wrong and it is a decrease in nitric oxide production?  Or is this some other change in the sensitivity of the endothelial cells to existing or even higher levels of nitric oxide available?

Specifically I'm referring to the wonderful aroma of a freshly broken up block of mushroom mycelium, but applies to the smell you pick up when you're in the woods and there is a lot of mushrooms nearby, or when you overturn a well-colonized clod of duff from the forest floor. It is a very particular odor that is definitely pleasant, almost sweet, earthy, and very rich or thick- if you've ever cultivated mushrooms of any sort, you know that powerful and aromatic smell I'm talking about.

Text: Hello!

First year bio student, just curious about how there seem to be so many zoonotic diseases originating in birds that can spread to humans. There's also a lot originating from other mammals like bats and rats, but that makes sense since humans are relatively closely related to them, and have really similar body systems and tissues. But birds confuse me as a common source of zoonotic diseases. I understand that they're really effective vectors and spreaders of disease, since they can cover so much distance easily and poop often all over the place, but on a biological system level I don't really understand. Birds and humans haven't shared an ancestor since over 200 million years ago, and have significantly different digestive and respiratory systems.   


Rambling aside, what i'm asking is why are we so compatible with birds in terms of diseases? How do so many diseases infect both birds and humans equally as easily when we're so different? Why do some diseases affect birds and humans, but not other mammals? What do birds and humans have in common that other mammals don't?

But like if we extended this, that would mean that at larger and larger scales, water has less apparent viscosity. Does that mean a minnow feels water as being thicker than I do? A whale feels water as being thinner than I do? But they both have similar structures for locomotion. If I were 600 feet tall, would swimming in honey feel the same as me being 6 feet tall swimming in water?

There's just a lot of consequences to this statement that start to pop up if it is in fact true.

North of Parker Ranch is Mt. Kohala which sports a lush forest. The elevation shift could explain the arid region on the other side of the mountain, however, the edge of the forest on the north side of the island is very geometric, suggesting land management as the culprit. A third option could be a mix of a rain shadow + land management but I'm not sure. Further, there could be other factors I'm not thinking about.

Thoughts?

There are various reconstructions of past global temperatures based on geological proxy evidence. There are some reconstructions going back 540 million years, though they get less certain as they go further back in time.

But it would be really interesting to know how the Snowball Earth events compared to later temperatures. And what the temperatures were like generally during the Proterozoic and Archean. (I already tried Google but couldn't find much.)

I understand there is less evidence for those times. I know they can't use shell isotopes because there were no hard shells. Still, I'm wondering if there has been any work done to figure out how temperature evolved before the Phanerozoic?

Nevertheless I have also read an article, which says that this statement is a myth (https://slate.com/technology/2022/11/brain-development-25-year-old-mature-myth.html). What’s your opinion on that topic? And if it’s true that the brain has not finished development until 25, how does a fully developed brain differ from a say 18 year old brain?

Text: Human hearts have two halves, one to pump blood around the lungs and another to pump blood around the rest of the body. Ok, makes sense, the oxygenation step is very important and there's a lot of tiny blood vessels to push blood through so a dedicated pumping section for the lungs seems logical.

But why are there two chambers per side? An atrium and a ventricle. The explanation we got in school is that the atrium pumps blood into the ventricle which then pumps it out of the heart. So the left ventricle can pump blood throughout the entire body and the left atrium only needs to pump blood *down* a couple of centimeters? That seems a bit uneven in terms of capabilities. 

Do we even need atria? Can't the blood returning from the body/lungs go straight into the ventricles and skip the extra step of going into an atrium that pumps it just a couple of centimeters further on?

Text: Something like how much of a chemical (lead, PFAS, acetaminophen, malathion, etc) on a daily basis, will eventually raise your risk of the associated serious health issue (neurological damage, compromised immune system, liver damage, etc.) significantly above the background level, over the course of your lifetime.

Bruce Ames (father of the Ames test for mutagenicity) advocated for the idea of &quot;Carcinogenic Potency&quot; in weighting health risks of different chemicals.  This takes into account both the mutagenicity and the level of exposure:  alcohol is only slightly mutagenic, but taking into account the much higher amount typically consumed, it was the the most potent carcinogen outside of smoking in his analysis.  But that's just for cancer.  

Now we are considering limiting PFAS in drinking water to 4 parts per trillion.  But the FDA already allows up to 8 ppm of the pesticide, Malathion, in some foods: 6 orders of magnitude more.  Does that really reflect the difference in risk?

TEMPO, [which launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket earlier this month](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-high-resolution-air-quality-control-instrument-launches), will monitor and report on levels of nitrogen dioxide, aerosols, and other pollutants several times a day.

TEMPO is the first-ever space-based instrument to measure air pollution over North America and will transform the way scientists observe air quality from space. TEMPO's observations of pollutants will take place during daylight hours and will have incredible and unprecedented accuracy-down to four square miles.

This data will play an important role in how scientists study and analyze pollution, including studies of rush hour pollution, the potential for improved air quality alerts, the effects of lightning on ozone, how pollution spreads from forest fires and volcanoes, and even the effects of applying fertilizer.

Ask us anything about TEMPO!

Text: These chemicals in your blood may cause autism (#7 will surprise you!)

If you are in the USA, there is a 70-80% chance you have pyrethroid pesticide metabolites in your blood right now. If you have a can of bug spray, they are likely in it. If someone sprays for insects in your apartment or home, this is likely what they are spraying. If you are in an area where they fog for mosquitoes, this is what they are spraying. It is used in landscaping in public green spaces and businesses. These pesticides are everywhere - and for good reason. They are considered completely safe for adults.

And yet, multiple recent studies have shown that exposure to pyrethroid class pesticides during pregnancy, or even just having them used within a mile of your house, is a risk factor for autism and neurodevelopmental disorders in the unborn child.

In my research, published today in the journal PNAS Nexus, we exposed three separate cohorts of pregnant mice to a &quot;safe&quot; low dose of the pyrethroid deltamethrin during pregnancy and lactation, then we examined the offspring. All three cohorts of offspring had hyperactivity, reduced vocalizations, increased repetitive behaviors, failed basic learning tests, and had wide ranging disruptions in the dopamine system in the brain. All symptoms which, in humans, are related to autism and neurodevelopmental disorders.

I am happy to answer all your questions! I will be on today at 12pm US EST (16 UT) until at least 5pm (21 UT). AMA!

Text: So, I was playing top trumps with my daughter, the Sea Life version (which i believe gets its data from the Encyclopaedia of Life), and my 6 year old daughter had the Sand Tiger Shark. She looked at the picture in which it looked pretty big and called the Weight stat. To her disbelief the card was beaten by my Beluga whale. They looked pretty similar, however her shark's weight of 87kg was dwarfed by the Beluga's 1,400kg. To explain why something of comparable size might have a weight of more than 15 times its rival i assumed it was something to do with bone density. However, my daughter then grabbed the Basking Shark card, which while twice as long as the Sand tiger shark had a weight of 5,200kg, or almost 60 times the weight. But they're both sharks she said, how come the Sand tiger is so light. I was stumped.

Could someone explain why there is such a varying weight (density) between shark species so i can tell my daughter? If possible both from an anatomical perspective and a practical/evolutionary one (so why)?

I have read countless articles, seen lots of video, but I still don't quite get it.

So far this is what I understand: Magnets and microwaves somehow ionize gas, makes it spin around the reactor and make plasma. That makes it hot enough to fuse atoms together to create energy.

Text: Hello,

I was curious about Antiviral medications.  For instance, there is an antiviral available for HIV now,  ART.  There are also Antivirals for things like Herpes Simplex 1; Acyclovir and others.

Antibiotics, to my understanding, are essentially a nuke.  They kill everything in the infected region.  We don't have that technique available to us for Viruses, though.  

So, I was curious - what are the traits of these Antivirals and what mechanisms do they have that result in successful treatment?  

Are Antivirals creating an environment that is prohibitive towards the Host's virus in their system, causing them to not duplicate or fail to do so?

And one more on the same topic - Are they basically the same medication, but just used in different quantities?  For instance, would ART also treat Herpes Simplex 1, Simplex 2, etc?  

Or are they entirely different in their form and function to treat other viruses?

Thank you for your time

 I know that it is water that triggers this, but more a a fundamental level what is the process in a microscopic or even molecular level. Is there a form chemical signal? or is just mechanical swelling? or something else?

Operating in Belize, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico, we track the health of the reefs in the area and evaluate each country's reef management efforts. I have a PhD in Marine Science from the University of South Florida and have also worked for the World Wildlife Fund and the Smithsonian Institution. I'm the author of more than 40 peer-reviewed research papers and the recipient of the 2021 Conservation Award from the International Coral Reef Society.

In 2013, an uncharted coral reef was discovered off the coast of Belize and Guatemala - but was kept rather secret until this year. Dubbed &quot;The Cayman Crown,&quot; this reef surpasses the size of Manhattan and is a refuge for a vast array of marine life, from schools of yellow jack and blue tang to bottlenose dolphins to the critically endangered - and commercially important - Nassau grouper. While not wholly immune to the dangers that face other reefs, such as overfishing, bleaching and invasive species, this reef's remarkable resilience is likely due to its position on the edge of the Cayman Trench. The hope is that this discovery can mark a new chapter in understanding corals and in saving coral reefs worldwide.

The Cayman Crown was given protected status in 2020 by both Belize and Guatemala, but there is still much to be done to ensure its conservation. You can learn more and see the first-ever footage of the reef in the new PBS *Nature* documentary &quot;[Treasure of the Caribbean](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/about-treasure-caribbean/28747/),&quot; now available to stream in the US.

I'll be answering your questions at 1 pm ET (17 UT). Ask me anything!

So my question is, why does a hot meal taste better than the exact same cold one?  I mean a cold tin of beans tastes terrible compared to a warmed tin of beans yet they physically have had nothing added or removed other than heat.

Is this something we perceive as being better because we are biologically programmed to feel more fulfilled after a hot meal, or is there a chemical change in the food which impacts flavour? 

Also why is this sometime the case in reverse, I.e cold pizza sometimes tastes better than hot pizza?

Text: If my question is confusing, it’s like this:

Every substance has spectral emission and absorption lines. We can use those to identify substances in and around objects in space, for example. However, these absorption and emission lines don’t correspond to the color of a substance if I were to look at it in a macroscopic amount. 

Like the spectral lines for indium make it appear indigo (hence the name) but in reality it is a silvery-white metal. Iodine (afaik) also has pretty weak violet lines in its spectra, but it appears that color in vapor form. This is odd to me because what a substance absorbs and reflects directly contributes to its color, and spectral lines (which describe that concept) seemingly don’t match up.

I’m sure I’m misunderstanding or misrepresenting something, so if someone could explain this to me I would appreciate it greatly.

What I'm wondering is, if these jellyfish and box jellyfish share a similar diet of small fish, why have large Chironex Fleckeri box jellyfish evolved to have the ability to kill multiple people within minutes while also being almost completely transparent? 

I can understand with snakes and spiders as they need to defend themselves and kill relatively large animals. But jellyfish face similar threats everywhere like turtles, whales, seabirds etc and they eat similar food like small fish and crustaceans while having massive differences in their ability to harm humans.

I was wondering if anyone is aware of any papers out there that investigate political beliefs while controlling for both education and occupation.

For context, I had a discussion with someone who was explaining that having a college degree is associated with being more liberal. I was wondering if that relationship still held up when controlling for occupation: is it the careers that college educated people end up in that make them more liberal?

E.g. a couple small business owners I know are more conservative and don’t have college degrees, is it being a small business owner that makes them more conservative? Or not having spent the 4 years in college?

I looked around for some research on this but didn’t have much luck finding exactly what I was looking for. Thanks in advance.

Text: I read a comment that said that the hormone testosterone is what makes the difference between males and females. So, males having a greater amount of testosterone than females during life and before being born makes their body different than females. And I guess that the user who made the comment (although they didn't explicitly tell it) thought that with the hormone estrogen the same logic applies.

I would like to know if there would be any differences between males and females if they had the same hormones and amount of them. I am aware that the chromosomes would still be different between males and females. But would there be any other physical differences? (strength, height, bones, prostate, face features, hips, breasts etc.) Also, would the genitals be different or the genitals need hormones (in this case hormones before birth) to become different between males and females? (As far as I know, the glans and the clitoris have a common origin, and the scrotus and the labia have a common origin too) 

Finally, I am sorry if it sounds strange or weird that I say *&quot;males&quot;* and *&quot;females&quot;* instead of *&quot;men&quot;* and *&quot;women&quot;*. I was honestly trying to not be offensive towards transgender people and didn't know what were the rigth words to use.

Now, let's say it starts moving and by the time it's 1 km away from me (t1), it's going 0.865c, which means it should look just 1 meter long to me. Does that mean that from my perspective, the back of the rod has traveled 1 meter further than the front? I.e. 999.5 meters for the front, and 1000.5 meters for the back?

To be more precise, the middle of the rod is touching my shoulder at t0, and the middle of the rod is exactly 1km away from that point at t1.

What now if the rod is 2km instead of 2m? Will the back of the rod seem to travel 1500 meters, and the front only 500 meters?

And, what if there are 3 2m rods, one 1km behind me, one 1km in front of me, and one next to me. They accelerate in unison. Do they individually become shorter, but stay 1km apart, or does the length between them also contract?

Text: So I was thinking of this scenario.

Say you take a pipe, fill it with water, cap the ends (kinda like a pipe-bomb) and throw it into the fire. Thermal energy will transfer from the heat of the fire to the pipe, to the water, causing it to boil and eventually explode when water turned to steam.

Now take the same pipe, fill with water and submerge it in liquid nitrogen.  Water will freeze, expanding it and do nearly exact same thing; exploding it..

Question is, if the fire is providing thermal energy to the water to explode it, but energy is leaving the water as it freezes, where is the energy coming from that bursts the pipe?

Text: Somebody posted this question [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/lkij7f/how_many_neurons_do_earthworms_have/), but the only answer given linked to an article about a nematode (C. elegans) and then said &quot;the bodies have a few more nerves because it’s longer but the nervous system will be relatively the same&quot;. But C. elegans and earthworms aren't even in the same phylum, so I'm skeptical of the assumption that earthworms will have similar numbers of neurons. Does anybody know of any numbers which have been found for earthworms specifically? Or for any annelid species?

Also, to alleviate any confusion, my question was referring to fossils that are millions of years old and not those young enough to be dated by using carbon-14.

How does every fossil we find contain enough radioactive nuclei and their daughter isotopes to accurately date? I was under the impression that elements like uranium are in general rare on earth and only present in significant quantities when they're concentrated by geologic processes over done. How do ordinary sedimentary rocks containing fossils contain enough to actually date?

Text:   

Hello,

I came across this article today (it was a busy weekend) and wanted some opinions on some thoughts inspired by it. The article is from Tyson (2023), which details an experiment that showed wood (altered) can be used to conduct electricity (Tran et al., 2023; Tyson, 2023). Tran et al. 2023, imply (to me) that the outcome was essentially a cellulose product that can be impregnated with a polymer to help conduct electricity and likely reduce the flammability. However, if I understand (Salmeia et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019) correctly; given the assumption that if heat can be used to create energy (Chu,2018), the opposite is true; and if that is the case heat is likely to be a byproduct from electricity (assumption based on energy loss/entropy). 

So, my initial question is: 

If Tyson (2023) and Tran et al. (2023) allow for a cellulose material  (impregnated in a polymer) that improves conductivity (and likely reduces flammability), and some concerns are conductivity of cellulose and the flammability (Salmeia et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019). An additional factor is an ability to create flame-retardant cellulose fibers better (Claire, 2023; Salmeia et al., 2016) and potentially combine them with the properties allocated (in this posting) to Tran et al., 2023. Primarily the impregnation and coating of the material with a polymer to increase conductivity and assumedly to reduce flammability (Chu, 2018; Salmeia et al., 2016; Tran et al., 2023; Tyson, 2023; Zhang et al., 2019). Could a layer of conductive metals, silver (Tran et al., 2023) or a silver and superalloy mixture (Sands, 2022; T. Smith, 2022; T. M. Smith et al., 2023); with an outer coating of the polymer that also incorporates a matrix structure (within the polymer) to facilitate conductivity better (Pan et al., 2022) comprised of the metals used, increase conductivity, and additively decrease flammability?

Additional Questions: Could the cellulose fibers (flame retardant) be created to include a matrix of metal fibers (second option) within its structure and be subsequently impregnated and further coated, as inquired about above?

   Thanks for any help or responses; I was trying to de-stress and grow (or correct my knowledge base). Have a Good Day!!

Text: Seeing as people living in regions with less sun coverage and less frequent exposure tend to have lighter blue eyes, it seems this is the body’s attempt to let more light in. With less melanin acting as sunglasses in the iris, it allows for better photon reception, thus letting more light in. This, of course, also means that people with lighter colored eyes are more sensitive to bright light/the sun. 

Anyways, if someone has blue eyes, and they moved up to Scandinavia in a darker region, would the melanin in their iris eventually lower and bring out a brighter shade of blue? 

Thanks strangers, cheers to science! Keep being awesome!

Text: Question provoked by New York Times article I read today showing that this form of hydropower is becoming more popular, but that's behind paywall so I wont share here. Here are two descriptions that are not behind paywall:

[https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/pumped-storage-hydropower](https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/pumped-storage-hydropower)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage\_hydroelectricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity)

I'm not in this field so take my description with a grain of salt, but my understanding is that for this type of power generation, water is used to generate electricity by gravity, similar to standard hydroelectric power (e.g. a dam), but in 'off hours', excess electricity is used to pump water up from a lower reservoir to an upper one. When more electricity is needed, that upper reservoir is used (gravity flow down to lower reservoir) to generate electricity. 

I must be missing something--to my mind, based on classical physics, this seems like it must be inefficient--how can we pump water uphill with electricity, then use that water flowing back downhill to generate more electricity than it took to pump it uphill? I must be missing something--perhaps there's always a secondary source of power churning in the background that is always available for electricity generation, so it's just excess electricity from this that is used to pump water uphill? 

Thanks in advance for enlightening me.

Text: I read today that polar bears have the best noses of mammals and can smell things up to 18 miles away. How is that calculated? Also how does that work? From my understanding smell is tiny pieces of whatever you’re smelling drifting off of the object and into your nose. I imagine it would have to be very specific circumstances for a smell to travel 18 miles. How fast can smell travel? How does it not get so diffused in the air that even if you could smell it you could pick it out of the background enough to actually do something useful with it.

Bonus question, sharks can smell blood in the water from great distances too, and I would imagine that smells travel much slower in water, so how does that work?

Text: So, I know that inside the chamber of the engine, fuel is mixed with air and thus combusted to create an explosion. 

Previously, this was my understanding:

Since the explosion expands equally in all directions, it provides force equally in all directions. The &quot;back&quot; of the engine passes through the opening at the back of the nacelle, providing no  force.

The &quot;front&quot; of the engine pushes against the inside of the nacelle, pushing it forward. 

However, recently I have read that its actually the gas *exciting* the nacelle which provides the thrust. How does that work?

Edit: Everyone keeps describing the rest of the turbojet, and I appreciate it but I have a (decent) understanding of the rest of the system. It's specifically how air escaping out the back moves the jet forward without pushing on it that's throwing me

Text: As demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic, settings like hospitals and nursing homes are highly susceptible to disease outbreaks. Recently, outbreaks of the fungus *Candida auris* havebeen reported in these locations. What makes these events so concerning is that *C. auris* is often resistant to standard antifungal treatments, spreads easily, and can be difficult to identify. What can be done to prevent a full-blown *C. auris* outbreak?

Join us today between 2 and 4 PM ET for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology, focused on the biological, clinical and policy aspects of preventing, diagnosing and fighting *C. auris*. We'll cover the science of what makes this fungal species so unique, talk
about treatment strategies and remedies, and share ideas for steps can be taken to prevent future outbreaks from happening. Ask us anything!

Text: Energy can not be created, nor destroyed,  only transformed. When a power plant generates electricity,  that energy gets used up instantly by some device on the other end. A power plant has to be able to predict energy usage and ramp up more generators to feed the need of their service area. They don't want to run out, so they would always be generating more power than the city uses in any given moment. That would leave a sizable excess of power in the system that wasn't used up by a device. The power plant is sending the next wave of power down the line, so that excess has to go somewhere. How does the power plant discharge the excess energy?

Text: Hallo everyone 

so pretty much what the title says.  So let's say that you get infected with a germ and your innate immunity takes care of it but not easily, thus meaning a day or two with very mild symptoms. Does your adaptive immunity still kicks in so the germ gets wiped out instantly in the second infection or does it do nothing and only kicks in when you get fully sick? The second case would mean that your innate immunity would have to fight and defeat the same germ over and over again causing you to have those very mild symptoms repeatedly over very long periods. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what happens in reality?

Text: I presume everyone is used to their own sense of depth, and adjusted to it, and it seems normal to them (because it *is* normal for them). But I've also noticed that stereoscopic images made with a wider parallax result in a 3-D image that appears stretched, deeper, and exaggerated.

It seems this would hold true for someone with more widely set eyes. If I wore specially designed prismatic eyeware that gave each eye a slightly further off-center view than I am used to, would I get the same elongated sense of depth? 

Would this offer an advantage to someone who relies on depth perception, like an NFL quarterback, or MLB pitcher? Would they be able to see more detail with their sense of depth, analogous to stretching out the linear display of a soundtrack, with sound editing software?

It makes sense that not having an atmosphere will always be better than correcting for an atmosphere but ground based telescopes have so many other advantages (much larger diameters, no similar concerns about weight or power restrictions, far fewer thermal issues) that I'm curious what unique advantages Hubble still has. When HST finally shuts down does it make sense to plan a future orbital optical telescope or is it only &quot;worth it&quot; for telescopes that operate in wavelengths that are blocked by our atmosphere?

Text: Hello everyone

I've been studying neuro-pathology and have been having difficulty in understanding how the pathophysiology of PD results in its clinical manifestation. This probably has an obvious answer but I haven't been able to figure it out.

What I've understood till now is that there's destruction of the dopamine-producing neurons in the Pars Compacta layer of the Substantia Nigra. Dopamine generally counters the normal inhibitory influence on motor activity in the Basal Ganglia so a decrease in dopamine would naturally make it harder to initiate muscle movement.

This would explain the bradykinesia, gait disturbances and dysarthria **but how would this result in rigidity and the resting pin-rolling tremor.** Why would this be seen when motor activity is already reduced?

I'm a med student and haven't studied neuroscience in detail so I'm sure there's something I'm missing. I've consulted my textbooks and google but still haven't found an answer.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated!

However, processes such as complete combustion and celular respiration create water, and photosynthesis destroys it. So, we have water being destroyed and new water being created all the time, essentially recicling our water.

This makes me think: how much of Earth's H2O is actually the same molecules that came to us through meteorites, and how much of it actually came from complete combustion?

Text: Imagine you are in a rotation room in empty space. There is no external force acting. In the room you will still feel a force pointing outwards and can clearly determine if the room is rotating. Why is the rotation reference frame special in that way? By pure definition it's not accelerated, shouldn't it be an inertial frame?

There is mach's theorem that says you can only detect relative rotation, i.e. rotation relatively to the rest of the universe. That would at least take away the absolute reference.

so my question is why is it possible to become immune to some things like the poison of a rattlesnake, and not to others like for example mercury.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it because venom is a biological composition of proteins and complex molecules and the body can learn to &quot;dismantle&quot; it and mercury is a simple metal?

&amp;#x200B;

but if that is why the body handles other metals as well, such as iron or zinc, calcium or gold in small quantities.

Text: I've been watching the BPS Space youtube videos on making a solid rocket motor, and the intuitive reasons for having a converging and diverging section don't really make sense. It seems like if there's a conservation of energy, then sending all the mass out the back of the engine would yield the same thrust, as long as the exhaust can all be directed backwards.

So the diverging section makes sense, it allows the exhaust to expand and bounce off the walls of the nozzle, ending it directly backwards. And in an ideal situation the pressure at the exit of the nozzle is exactly ambient and all the exhaust is going directly backwards.

But wouldn't that happen anyways without the converging part?

I keep seeing people say that the converging part gets the velocity up to mach 1, and that chokes the nozzle. Does that mean that because the nozzle is choked the pressure inside the combustion chamber can get higher since the exhaust can't get out of the nozzle any faster, no matter how high the pressure is? And then because there's a higher pressure, more energy can be extracted from the pressure differential? If that's the case I don't understand how the higher pressure affects the downstream exhaust? How does it make the exhaust move faster in the diverging part?

I cannot seem to find a scientific answer for or against a moonbow being possible during a solar eclipse. Given its decreased brightness - I like to think the ghostly white &quot;rainbow&quot; similar to at night is not completely out of the realm of possibility. To wrap up my main question - given perfect conditions of the sun height, clarity of the sky, water droplets present in the air, etc. - is it actually possible to get the faint white moonbow during a solar eclipse?

Louis Pasteur’s germ theory came out in the 1860s, by then people were well in control of fermentation processes and were able to create distinct flavors without even knowing bacteria existed. What was their logic/reasoning behind their methods? 

For example if we mix a batch of bread dough too warm, we know the dough will ferment quickly because bacteria are more active in warmer environments. If a baker mixed dough too warm in 1820, what did he think was happening?

Text: Apologies if this is the wrong tag, I was torn between biology and chemistry and medicine.

I understand that the mechanism behind washing with soap and water as an effective pathogen control mechanism is a combination of friction, water washing things away, surfactants lifting oils (and anything mixed in) off the surface down with the water, and the breaking of lipid layers that enclose many pathogens. 

I have eczema and am looking for options that are less likely to aggravate the condition, and these &quot;soap free&quot; cleansers keep coming up, as well as things with &quot;gentle surfactants&quot; like Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate. 

My question is, do the differences between these products reduce the effectiveness of handwashing? Say, after using the toilet or handling raw meat, would such a thing be an appropriate swap for normal   liquid hand soaps?

Text: I visited the very impressive Wieliczka Salt Mine recently, and something occurred to me: Where are the natural caves?

I'm no geologist, but I've been in plenty of limestone caves to know these basic facts (which I'm spelling out so that I may be corrected if I'm operating on incorrect knowledge): Limestone is soluble in acid, and water is ever so slightly acidic (there's also a role played by microbes). A flow of water causes the slow dissolution  of the limestone over time, eventually carving a cave system.

Now salt is far more easily soluble than limestone in water, so there should have been vast natural caverns. And there is certainly water present under there, I saw it, and it needs to be pumped as in most mines.

So where are the caves?

Text: I am getting ready to move to Asia later this year for a few years of traveling, and I'm reading up on the recommended vaccines. One of the recommended vaccines is the Japanese Enciphilitis vaccine.

When reading about JEV, I read that pigs and some birds are common breeding grounds for the virus, then mosquitos will contract the virus from the diseased animal. However, humans can only contract the virus if they get bit by a diseased mosquito, and not if they eat the diseased animal. 
 
Virology/science has never been my strong point (I'm a financial advisor, so my strength is in finance/economics), so I don't understand how you don't get sick if you eat the diseased animal. Do our stomachs have some acids that breakdown certain viruses or something? Do viruses require special types of hosts to develop to the point it can affect humans?

Text: 
I don't know much about stats so excuse the question. But every day I come across studies that make claims, like coffee is good for you, abused children develop mental illness in adulthood, socializing prevents Alzheimer's disease, etc.
  

  
But rarely are any of these findings from true experiments. That is to say, the researchers either did not do a random selection, or did not randomly assign people to either do the behavior in question or not, and keeping everything else constant.
  

  
This can happen for practical reasons, ethical reasons, whatever. But this means the findings are correlational. I think much of epidemiological research and natural experiments are in this group.
  

  
My question is that with some of these studies, which cost millions of dollars and follow some group of people for years, can we draw any conclusions stronger than X is associated/correlated with Y? How? How confident can we be that there is a causal relationship?
  

  
Obviously this is important to do, otherwise we would still tell people we don't know if smoking &quot;causes&quot; a lot of diseases associated with smoking. Because we never conducted true experiments.

People always talk about the nutrients, the smaller stuff. But I'm looking for what is holding the fruit together. Watermelon is mostly water but if you try to pick up water, it would just fall out. Watermelon is able to keep all of it's water in so there must be something holding it all together? I've tried quick googling. My first thought was fiber but nothing has confirmed this guess. I was chewing on a watermelon a second ago and thought, ok I've swallowed all the juice/water, what am I chewing?

Coreect me if I'm wrong but meats are made up of protein, the thing holding it together and plants are held up by cellulose (a type of fiber). Which makes me think watermelon and all fruits the same are held up by cellulose. 

To add to this, what would the flesh of apples, bananas, and other fruits be made of?

Text: I've recently learned to scuba dive, and naturally I've been looking up all the places I might be able to dive in the future, and asking experienced divers I know their thoughts about where the most interesting spots to dive with aquatic life are.

I've been surprised to find that freshwater lakes and rivers don't seem to have much in the way of macroscopic biological structures that create habitat, unlike oceans (which have corals, kelp forests, soft-bodied anemones, huge clam beds, seagrass meadows, etc). It also seems that freshwater animals stem from a severely restricted subset of overall aquatic life. Divers have been telling me that the only really interesting stuff to see in freshwater are wrecks. This is wild to me.

I spent a while trying to find out whether there were structurally complex biological underwater environments in the Great Lakes, thinking that massive lakes must surely support lots of interesting variety, but I'm not finding much variety in environments beyond scenes of greyish fish swimming around over relatively flat sediment or rocky bottoms.

I'm confused by this. I know that small ponds and bogs can be full of stuff like rushes and lily pads and duckweed and other things, so I'd expect to see that sort of environment grow larger and more varied with more space in lakes and rivers. With shallower waters (compared to the ocean) and a high ratio of edge-to-area where biomass from land can enter the water to provide nutrients or evolutionary access points, I'd have thought there would be an abundant variety of aquatic plant life, and that you'd see things like kelp forests or lily pad groves or lake-grass meadows; and I know freshwater hydras exist, so I'm surprised there aren't freshwater sessile cnidarians forming beds along lake bottoms. 

I've heard the mineral content of freshwater is too low for animals that form hard structures like corals, but there are plenty of soft-bodied structures in the ocean too that don't seem to have developed in freshwater. There are a few microbialites in places like Pavilion Lake, BC, but those seem to exist in lakes that are otherwise relatively low in biological activity.

What are some of the factors that prevent these things from evolving in freshwater? Or do they exist plentifully elsewhere, maybe just not at temperate latitudes?

Text: To start, I'm a biologist and am absolutely NOT questioning evolutionary theory. What's been bothering me though is when people ask the question &quot;Why did Trait X evolve&quot;? What they're asking of course is &quot;Why was Trait X advantageous?&quot;. Usually someone comes up with some logical reason why Trait X was advantageous allowing everyone to sit around and ponder whether or not the explanation is reasonable. If something doesn't come to mind that makes more sense, the explanation is usually agreed upon and everyone moves on. Ok cool, but we know of course that not all traits are propagated by natural selection. Some are propagated by genetic drift. Some traits may not confer a particular reproductive/survival advantage, they could be neutral, or just not mal-adaptive enough to be selected out of the population. 

So, outside of inductive logic, can we ever have empirical evidence for what factor(s) caused Trait X to be selected? I can sit here and tell you that a particular bird evolved feather patterns to blend in with its surroundings, thus giving it the adaptive advantage of avoiding predators, but this may not be true at all - it could be sexual selection or genetic drift that caused the trait to persist. While some adaptations selective pressures may be so obvious that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent, many are not so obvious and we should be cautious assigning causation when only correlation may exist.

Text: It seems like it’s a foregone conclusion nowadays that fractals and the Fibonacci sequence and golden ratio etc… are found in nature all over. 

But when I see examples, it doesn’t quite add up (to my admittedly ignorant mind) , I see spirals sure, but it’s not exactly the Fibonacci sequence

I see branches etc that are “reminiscent” of fractals, but they are *not* fractals because I thought fractals can’t exist in nature?

Just looking for some honest/open minded clarity.

Thank you.

Text: I’m not just talking about size- like their actual physiology and nutrients on a cellular level. (Apologies in advance if none of what I’m about to say makes sense, I know very very little about biology lol, i’m just trying to learn more :)

So say you have two tiger cubs. Both the same size. You feed them each the same quantity of meat every day (progressively they both get more as they grow etc.) You feed them cows. But one gets 6 KG worth of Runt cow meat, and one gets 6 KG worth of cow meat from ONLY the biggest cows in the herd (but both the runt and big cow are the same age!) Is there an actual different between the quality of meat? And will one tiger grow up to be stronger/healthier because of the meat’s quality?

Again, maybe something in this example doesn’t make sense, sorry about that. 
An example with humans is that someone eats 0.1 kg of bananas that are small, and someone else eats 0.1 kg of bananas that are gigantic. But both bananas came from the same place and were the same age.

And continuing on that, what about an animal with a genetic deformity? If you eat a cow that was born with brain damage, but you only eat the thighs, is there still a noticeable difference? Or how about a cow with muscular dystrophy? Or a cow with some sort of nervous system disorder? Not like a disease, just a defect.

Does that mean anything? does it imply that another one can occur in the next let's say, 1-2 years? or does it mean that it wont ever again?
  

  
Also, is there any way to predict the next one? I ask this cause like, we can predict when suns will end, blockholes fade away, and stuff like that, and it seems kinda weird that we can't predict that(? (altho ik that it might not be that simple if we don't have a prediction))

Text: Hello fellow science enthusiasts!
  

  
I've recently been fascinated by the concept of time dilation, a fundamental part of Einstein's Theory of Relativity. It's a mind-bending idea that time moves slower as you approach the speed of light or experience stronger gravity.
  

  
Now, we know that astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) are moving much faster than we are on Earth and experience a weaker gravitational pull. Over the course of their stay on the ISS, their clocks would tick slower relative to ours, but this effect is extremely tiny given the speeds and gravitational differences involved.
  

  
My question is: what tangible effects, if any, does this difference in the passage of time have on the astronauts' bodies and minds? Does it affect their biological clocks, circadian rhythms, or even the rate at which they age?
  

  
Also, on a psychological level, do astronauts report feeling any different in their perception of time? I've read reports of many astronauts experiencing what is known as the &quot;overview effect&quot;, a cognitive shift in their understanding of life and reality when viewing the Earth from space. Could changes in the passage of time contribute to this phenomenon in any way?
  

  
Thank you for your insights in advance! I'm excited to dive deeper into this topic.

Text: I'm asking this question because I'm a bit stumped. I was reading up on iron's role in star death which got me curious about the energy release of fusion &amp; fission reactions throughout the periodic table. It seems intuitive to me that a nuclear energy output equation would look something like this:  
\*energy output = (Mass of extra products converted to MeV) - (nuclear binding energy)\*  
So for example, if a reaction produces an extra 2 neutrons, would your energy output be the mass of the 2 neutrons minus the binding energy required to get them to split?  
Is the above correct or do I have a missing piece(s) somewhere?

Text: I am professor Ilan Marek, (https://ilanmarek.technion.ac.il), one of the best synthetic organic chemists in the world today. I have received accolades every single year from different organizations and different countries (the last one being the Arthur C. Cope Scholar Award from the American Chemical Society, prize which is not frequently awarded to non-American citizens), and have been elected to the French Academy of Sciences in 2017 and to the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities in 2019. I am an editorial board member of a long list of important journals in organic chemistry from different countries and societies. I have educated 44 MSc and PhD students and 43 post-doctoral fellows in my career, 26 are now faculty members in different countries and the rest are occupying important positions in various chemical or pharmaceutical companies.

The world population is rapidly expanding. 2.5 new inhabitants (on average) are born every second. By 2050, our planet is going to be inhabited by 10+ billion people. To maintain and improve the global quality of life while meeting the needs of an expanding world population, the production of food, medicine, consumer, and new technology products must be increased to meet this growing demand. Can the world sustain its growing population in the same way we did up to now, without causing additional ecological damage and further depleting natural resources?

To give just one example of the increasing environmental impact of modern life, in the last 70 years, the production of plastic increased from 1.5 million tons per year in 1950 to 450 million tons per year in 2022. That would be fine if one knew how to handle plastics after usage. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Only 9% of plastic is recycled. In 2020 alone, more than 20 million tons of plastics ended up in the sea, creating a floating mass twice the size of Texas in the Pacific Ocean. If we keep on like this, by 2050 there will be more plastic in the sea than fish. If that's not enough, recent studies found micro particles of plastic in people's blood and lungs.

We are in a situation where drastic changes are needed. To support the needs of the growing population, to maintain and improve the life expectancy and life quality we're taking for granted, we cannot just produce more. We need to produce better.

The answer, I believe, lies in catalysis.

A catalyst is any substance that triggers or speeds up a chemical reaction. Catalysts are crucial for life itself: they control our cells, perform our digestion, form part of our immune systems. Catalysts also make modern life possible: they play key roles in food production, drug and materials manufacturing, energy production and many other fields. It is hard to imagine the world today, or indeed civilized society in general, without the impact of catalysis on all fundamental aspects required for life.

Catalysis stands at the nexus of many disciplines, enabling discoveries that impact areas as diverse as health (e.g., medicine, imaging), food (agrichemicals), energy (efficiency, storage, sustainable manufacturing) and more, and as such, forms an important part of the global economy. It is generally associated with underpinning approximately 30% of global GDP, representing roughly 3 trillion USD, and is involved at some point in the processing of 90% of all manufactured products.

To answer these crucial problems, The Technion has created the Resnick Sustainability Center for
Catalysis - the first of its kind in Israel and one of only a handful of similar projects
worldwide - embodies a compelling vision: Innovation in catalysis is key to solving many of the great challenges facing us today. The goal of the Center is to discover and develop new catalysts touching many different fields. This will be achieved by harnessing the Technion's stellar resources in chemistry, biotechnology, physics, biology, computer science, chemical engineering, materials engineering and food engineering - all within a single facility. The Center will serve as an incubator for talent, ideas and solutions, not only strengthening the Technion's reputation as a world leader in this area but also potentially ensuring that the Israeli economy benefits from the improved industrial processes and a lucrative set of exportable technologies that will result from their implementation.

In contrast to the traditional laboratory setup - in which researchers work in isolation from each other - The Resnick Sustainability Center for Catalysis will feature an innovative open space research laboratory model, providing lab space for new faculty members and their teams. There are several reasons for this approach: to enhance multidisciplinary collaboration in a field that is evolving ever more rapidly, to pool the use of advanced pieces of equipment among multiple researchers, and to encourage researchers from two or more academic disciplines to combine their expertise to solve major problems in the field. The Technion believes that the pace of innovation and discovery made possible by this open-space laboratory setup is likely to exceed the pace expected from a conventional lab arrangement.

Text: I have seen a few videos recently of volcanos erupting. It is my understanding that volcanic eruptions can cause a VERY slight cooling effect on the earth because of the chemicals they shoot into the atmosphere and the amounts of them. But I’m wondering about something a little more abstract. 

If the surface temperature of the earth is increasing, even slightly, due to the many factors that contribute to it, would the core of the earth also be increasing in heat? If so, Is there any way to know what 1 degree Celsius increase of surface temp would equate to in terms of the core of the earths temperature rising? Or is this concept fundamentally wrong?

If it’s not wrong, could an increase in the earths core temperature increase the frequency of volcanic eruptions, ultimately leading to more global “cooling” due to the effect of volcanic eruptions?

Text: I've been learning about general relativity for the past few days, and I'm a bit stumped. 
  

  

  

  
Assume for a moment there was a spaceship going 99% the speed of light away from earth, and that that it reached that speed in 5 seconds. Everything I've been reading states that the spaceship is the one that is considered to be &quot;moving&quot; because it experiences a shift in inertial frames. The reason I say &quot;moving&quot; is because one of the two objects (the earth or the spaceship) must feel the effects of time dilation. When the spaceship returns from its journey, time will have moved more on earth. But my question is that if the spaceship is going at near the speed of light away from earth for a year, and then back for another year, and if the acceleration to that speed, as well as the stopping to return both took 5 seconds than why does the 10 cumulative seconds of acceleration and deceleration determine who experiences the effects of time dilation? And more importantly, does that mean that the &quot;history&quot; of where an object has been determines whether or not is objectively the one &quot;moving&quot;?
  

  

  

  
I hope that I've asked this question in a way that is clear, and concise. When I say an objects &quot;history&quot;, I mean to say that if the object (in this example the spaceship) never accelerated, and was always moving at near the speed of light, then it would be hard to say which of the two objects has a faster ticking clock due to time dilation. Thus to me it seems like in general relativity an objects past inertia determines the effects it feels via time dilation.

&amp;#x200B;

Also as a note, if we assume that space-time is curved, I think that this issue can seem to be more apparent. Assume the spaceship never stops to turn back around, and keeps continuing in a straight line until it comes back around to reach earth. If you say that the people on earth are much older (due to time dilation) than the man on the spaceship, then it would mean you are arguing that the earth is the one that is stationary, yet it should be relative. It would mean that the brief 5 seconds of acceleration to near the speed of light is the only arbitrary thing determining the next **X** amount of years of the entire journey.

It isn’t literally a mix of the two noses right? I apologize if this seems silly. Does the same go for eye color? If a blue eyed person and brown eyed person reproduce, if their child doesn’t have either blue or brown, it isn’t a true mix of blue and brown, but just the eye color of a relative?

Would the water not eventually recede? How can water permanently flood a place unless it’s a basin?

I understand how natural selection would select for extensions of already occurring qualities; even SLIGHTLY longer necks in giraffes would be IMMEDIATELY more advantageous and increase the likelihood of producing offspring. 

Surely a wing wouldn’t evolve all at once, but at the same time a gradual wing development would seem disadvantageous in the span of a single generation or even multiple and wouldn’t be selected for. A small bump or even the beginning of a wing that doesn’t function properly wouldn’t be selected for right?

It seems like the kinda appendage that would need to be mostly there and mostly functional but wouldn’t be spontaneously selected for over the course of many generations.

Were self-serve buffets a worse place for viral transmission than other restaurants? Especially when compared/contrasted with places like Chipotle, which also has people in close proximity, but does not have people touching serving tools and probably much less ability to cough towards food.

It seems that initial-to-middle of the pandemic reporting indicated that Covid transmission via food itself was extremely unlikely. Transmission via serving tools, like tongs, could certainly happen, but transmission through the air via aerosolized particles was still the biggest threat.

Text: I stumbled upon [this graph,](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a1b12d3335c8b8323df531a098ab78ec) which seems to indicate that, while the incidence rates of most cancers included in the data set stayed roughly the same during the 5 years following 1987, in the same time span, the rate of prostate cancer more than doubled (and then dropped off significantly). Does this peak and subsequent drop-off reflect actual changes in number of cases, or new thresholds in identifying cancers, or just new ways of counting the data, etc?

Text: As a child of the 90s, I was taught in science class that nothing decays in a typical US land fill. To prove this they showed us core samples of land fill waste where 10+ year old hot dogs looked the same as the day they were thrown away. But today I keep hearing that waste in land fills undergoes anaerobic decay and releases methane and other toxic gasses.

Was I just taught false information? Has there been some change in how land fills are constructed that means anaerobic decay is more prevalent today?

One thing I noticed is that when I sing, the stutter goes away completely. So that got me thinking. Can you train your brain to use the part that it's using for singing for example, to use it for speaking, thus making the stutter go away completely. I'm sorry if this is a stupid question, and I know I might ask for the impossible. But still, I consider it an interesting thought.

Text: A little googling suggests that the total biomass of the earth has been declining at least since the human age (no surprise), if not much earlier.

Are there good estimates of the time course of Earth's biomass over the planet's history? Did it slowly and continuously ramp up until recently (with, I guess, big dips when an asteroid hit or other mass extinctions occur)? Or is there a plateau that it hit early and generally sustains (quickly re-attaining after mass extinctions)?

Sub-questions:

Are there good estimates of biomass saturation times for subdivisions of life? Like, I guess maybe Bacteria peaked earlier than Eukaryotes, but then got another boost by living with Eukaryotes? When did arthropods saturate? When did vertebrates saturate (have they yet)?

(The dumb shower thought that led to this question: I wonder if, millions of years from now, it will be easier to find fossilized disposable diapers than it is, today, to find fossilized trilobites? How many trilobites were there? Billions, trillions? How many disposable diapers in landfills are there?)

Text: I have type 1 diabetes and manage my blood glucose with a CGM, pump, and insulin (Novorapid which is supposedly identical to human insulin).

Recently I have been using an APS (artificial pancreas system) which links my CGM and pump together to effectively emulate a healthy human pancreas. This APS system doesn't work perfectly and I often have high glucose after meals and occasionally low glucose (usually due to the absorption speed of meals or exercise).

I don't know any of the technical parts of how the pancreas does its job in managing glucose levels, but I have a good understanding of how to manage my own diabetes regardless. 

My main two questions would be:
1. How does the pancreas prevent (or at least reduce) sudden spikes in glucose after a meal?
2. How does insulin on board not affect healthy people (non diabetics) as much during exercise?

To add to the first question, as a T1 diabetic I need to inject (using a pump) a predetermined amount of insulin based on the total carbohydrates in a meal and this is a very rough estimate because absorption speeds can vary greatly. In a closed loop APS, the only way I've seen people prevent spikes (without knowing the carbs) is having insulin already on board but I don't understand how this would be possible in a healthy human body which isn't warned in advance about food.

To add to the second question, it is often too risky for me to exercise just after a meal because of all the insulin on board. The only method I can think of to reduce the risk of a hypo during exercise is to inject less insulin for the meal, but from the first question I either need to know this in advance or I need to be injecting small increments whenever I see a rise in glucose which would also result in hyperglycaemia.

I suppose I should also mention that CGMs measure glucose from the interstitial fluid, so trends are usually delayed by 10-15 minutes (although I'd assume the current glucose level can be extrapolated).
Also there are faster types of insulin available, such as Fiasp and Lyumjev, but I'd like to focus on why human insulin is still effective without needing these properties.

Thanks for reading!

Text: In other words, how much do sports-specific skills transfer to different but related tasks in the real world?

I have a number of follow up questions too:

- Does it matter _which_ sports you play, or would most vigorous and contact sports more or less accomplish the job?

- Also, how much do specific skills matter? Is throwing skill, as one example, a crucial skill to learn at a young age? Would throwing not only train the muscle groups that throw things but also develop a deep intuition for projectiles and judging distances, which would be hard to learn from other experiences?

- What is it like for an adult to attempt to learn sports skills for the first time?

These are tricky questions for me to research. It's one thing to learn the biomechanics of the body or a specific technique, but it's another to learn longitudinally how much my learning that is in any way beneficial to me for something other than the sport itself. I guess I've always assumed that there were tons of direct correlation benefits, but I don't actually have an answer to that, and I don't know what studies have been done on this.

Text: First time posting on this sub, don't go to hard on me if I do something wrong please!  


I was thinking about this while looking at a lightning strike that curved quite weirdly, and struck something that really didn't seem like the most optimal point. I had never really thought to look deeper into how it, and the whole &quot;path of least resistance&quot; thing worked and accepted that statement at face value. While thinking about how it would work, I tried to picture the below experiment in my head, but couldn't quite make sense of it. I don't have the means to actually do it myself, but I'm still burningly curious and google has not helped.  


Two long rods of different conductive materials are connected in the middle of their length by a strip of a third conductive material. One of the two rods is made of a material with &quot;medium&quot; conductivity, while the other is substantially more conductive. The strip in the middle is still conductive but is much poorer at it than either of the other two. Attached to the &quot;medium&quot; conductivity rod is a source of electricity. For instance a Car Battery.   


How would electricity flow in this situation? Would it follow the &quot;medium&quot; rod to it's end, ignoring the bridge over? Personally I am not sure if it would be able to realize that there is a potentially &quot;better&quot; path for it on the other side of this obstacle, obviously since there is no intelligence to it. But would it do so if the other side is &quot;worth it&quot; anyways? Or would it spread throughout the entire device like a liquid through a series of tubes, only being slowed down not stopped entirely by the resistive bridge?  


If it does flow only or primarily down the &quot;worse&quot; path because a seemingly terrible obstacle is all it can &quot;see&quot;, the situation would remind me of the False Peak concept, which I primarily know from exposure to Ai Learning, or in the context of trying to find the highest point in a given map.  


Thank you in advance for your answers, I hope I was not just spouting easily explained nonsense.

Text: I'm a pescatarian, so I eat a lot of seafood. Of course, most seafood contains mercury thanks to methylmercury absorption by plankton/fish which are subsequently eaten by predatory fish (bioaccumulation). Most of the time, the mercury content won't have an impact on humans. However, humans start suffering from the mercury content once they consume too many &quot;apex fish predators&quot; (sharks, baraccuda, tuna, etc).

Those predatory fish, especially sharks, don't suffer from mercury poisoning despite their high mercury consumption. 

I know our biology isn't the same as fish, but why is it that we can't build up a resistance to mercury (or other heavy metals) to the same degree as predatory fish? I've heard it might be possible (the Japanese have been eating seafood heavy diets for tens of thousands of years), but it seems as if we can only &quot;evolve&quot; so much in this regard. I'd imagine if anyone could build up an exceptional tolerance, it would probably be East Asians or Polynesians  considering they've been eating predatory fish for longer than anyone else...but their mercury tolerance doesn't seem that much higher than anyone else's.

I read Kahnemanns 'Thinking, fast and slow' maybe 10 years ago and just finished a book about Acceptance &amp; Commitment therapy and to me it seems like the ideas in each synergize very well. 

E.g. ACT talks about 'fusion' of cognitive processes with behavior - a system 1 acting automatically - and proposes 'observing' your cognitive processes and 'defusing' these with behavior - a more deliberate and conscious system 2. Has there been any research into this? It seems like it could help therapy if the ways to assist system 2 are employed?

I'm not sure of the scientific standing of either of these models, especially in the face of the replication crisis but any input is appreciated. Thanks!

Text: I’m curious if there is an evolutionary analogy to piranhas, but for the oceans.  
I know piranhas are not mindless buzzsaw fish that kill everything in their path. But the cliche feeding frenzy school is something they actually do from time to time. This behaviour means they can tackle large live prey and large pieces of carrion.  
So, is there a kind of ocean fish that is similar to piranhas in this respect? A small, schooling fish that has sharp teeth and engages in feeding frenzy behaviour in large numbers.  
Note: This question specifically excludes sharks as they are large and, even though they sometimes form groups, are not a schooling fish. This question is specifically about little guys in large numbers that tackle large prey en masse.

Text: I read a comment recently that said:

“…the clean air act in the 1960s which regulates sulfur dioxide emissions, the cause of acid rain, removed a lot of the particular matter from the air which reflected away from the surface or the earth—it was partially responsible for the earth warming.—We screwed with the atmosphere and in trying to do good, it did clean up the acid rain (somewhat) but came back and bit us in the a** with a warming effect as it let more of the sun’s rays through”

Is this true to some extent? Did the clean air act, which I always thought was an amazing policy because of the wonders it did for our air quality, have the unintended effect of accelerating global warming by boosting the greenhouse effect?

I know if I looked this up, I would only get a bunch of hard to understand research papers, so I am asking it here. Any answers are greatly appreciated.

it's a question I keep coming back to as I work on my thesis and I do not yet have a solid idea about this.
  

  
Say, on a behavioral level person A has a significantly smaller difference than person B in reaction times between the congruent and incongruent conditions in a Stroop-test (indicating better inhibitory control). How would you imagine they would differ in an EEG recording?
  

  
I tried my best in researching this myself, but all I could find sound evidence for is the [association between n2/n4 and inhibition as a cognitive process.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33217721/)

Text: Hi Reddit! We're Ruby Leung, Mark Wigmosta, and Andre Coleman from the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). We're here today to discuss [our scientific approach to tackling wildfires](https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/taming-tomorrows-wildfires), an issue that has become increasingly prominent, particularly in the Western United States.

As the wildfire seasons seem to extend and intensify each year, our team and fellow researchers are diligently working on predicting, preventing, and mitigating these disasters. From predicting the occurrence and direction of big blazes to implementing strategies to prevent future fires, our team is leveraging a broad spectrum of scientific perspectives to combat wildfires.

One of our tools, [the RADR-Fire satellite system](https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/rapid-analytics-disaster-response), led by Andre Coleman, helps firefighting personnel, utilities operators, and other decision makers better understand a fire's behavior so they can make informed choices in the midst of natural disaster. It also aids utility operators assess risk by identifying areas prone to wildfire and which energy infrastructure needs protection.

On the preventative side, Mark Wigmosta and team have developed a new tool with the U.S. Forest Service to determine where controlled burns or thinning would be most effective in reducing fire hazards. Such measures have been found to potentially reduce fire hazards by 25-96 percent in certain cases, and also yield benefits like reduced smoke and increased streamflow.

Meanwhile, Ruby Leung is leading a team in creating models that consider an expanded list of &quot;wildfire predictors,&quot; delivering a more complete picture of how likely it is that a fire strikes, how far it burns, and how much smoke it releases into the atmosphere.

Our collective work is helping us get an edge on tomorrow's wildfires, making utilities more resilient to natural disasters, and increasing our understanding of fire behavior in response to climate change. We're here today to discuss our research, the scientific principles behind it, and how we see it impacting the future of wildfire management.

We'll be on at **8am pacific (11 AM ET, 15 UT)**, ask us anything!

Text: It's fairly common knowledge that a lot of animals, including humans, share a common bone structure. Jointed limbs, often with smaller appendages at the ends of each. Spines, rib cages, etc. Mammals all share the structure with variations; horses, for example, traded tactile digits for stumpy legs, using the framework for claws to produce hooves, but retaining the same basic bones and joints. Even reptiles, amphibians, and birds share the same components.

How far back does one need to look to find a common ancestor that first developed this basic skeleton shape? Why was this the shape that stuck among most vertebrate creatures, and what prompted bones to develop among *boneless* life to begin with?

I wanted to know how we determine which side of the animal is the dorsal/ventral side. It seems pretty obvious when it comes to planaria or sharks ( the side that faces the ground when they're in their 'usual positions' is ventral) but how do we determine which side is the dorsal/ventral side in animals like humans? Is it an arbitrary concept like the equatorial line that we have come up with for convenience? 

I know the anterior side of an animal is determined by cephalization and the concentration of sensory structures/ganglia/brain. Is there a specific parameter like that for the dorsal/ ventral sides?

Text: I’ve been fascinated by the Hubble Tension, and I know there are two primary avenues towards deriving this value (though I’m aware of other newer methods such as using gravitational waves). The first — involving measuring distances &amp; velocities via standard candles like Cephied Variables and Type 1a supernovae — is intuitive and readily understandable by a layman like me. But I never see any details on how the expansion rate is calculated from the other primary method, that of examining the Cosmic Microwave Background.

Is there an intuitive not-too-technical way of explaining how the value is found via the CMB?

Text: trying to understand space walks better..
  
If a = v-v0/t (acceleration formula) and you throw a tennis ball in space, the starting velocity is the same as the end velocity due to no air resistance (object in motion stays in motion). Because then numerator will always = 0 so no acceleration.  

And if not, then the ball would surely fall back to earth. And if that’s true, wouldn’t humans also float towards earth away from the ISS on a spacewalk?  

And gravity is still present even at the ISS. Satellites use fuel to stay in orbit (yet the moon seemingly orbits earth in a way where gravity is not pulling it closer essentially in a perfect way which IMO proves godlike or spiritual influence on literal matter for it to be there over 1000s of years), so how is a human on a spacewalk not being dragged by their tether and instead it looks as if they move with it. Or is the force of the spaceship canceling out gravity what keeps the human moving at a constant rate seemingly locked in place?  
  
Blows my mind that the ISS is going 17k+ mph and the humans with it.

Text: (Just a heads up, I'm painfully aware of how obnoxiously long this is, Sorry about that!)

What exactly does stability of the group reagent (dil HCl, conc H2SO4, BaCl2, etc..) mean in this context?

To quote my textbook exactly (this is highschool-level chem by the way, but feel free to add more details as long as the explanation itself has that in mind): &quot;Hydrochloric acid is **more stable** than the acids from which the group anions are derived, so when it reacts with these anions salts, it replaces the less stable acids which are easy to volatilize or decompose in the form of gases which can be detected by suitable reagents &quot;

Is it an inherent property of any reagent in isolation, which is then compared to the required anions' acids (at least for groups whose reagent is an acid) to determine the suitable reagent for each group (As in Kc of the reagent and the produced acid are orders of magnitudes apart that the reagent's anions are undetectable?, but that wouldn't really make sense considering HCl and H2SO4 are strong acids dissociation-wise), So if all we cared about was that the reagents don't dissociate much relative to the products (ppt./volatile gas), considering strong acids would be borderline stupid.

Is it a property that is fundementally dependent on the ions in question, as in that it's defined as being &quot;with respect to&quot; said anion rather than &quot;more stable _than_&quot; it in some universal sense?
(At least for when the group reagent is a specific salt (BaCl2, for example), is it that the salt's cation really &quot;wants&quot; to bond with its group anions, beacuse that chemical releases a significant amount energy when formed which is what stability normally means, but then again, what about strong acids?)

Is it more nuanced than this? Is it a blend of these views? 

Also is it different depending on whether the reagent is an acid, a salt, an acidified other type of chemical, or something else? I mean, they are different chemicals and it would make sense that they get different treatments when deciding what reagent works for what, but then again, I have no idea what stability means *in this context* so I'm probably being unnecessarily verbose because I'm missing something pretty simple.

Bonus Question: Why do we use **Dilute** HCl in one group, but **Concentrated** H2SO4 in another? Is it because conc H2SO4 prevents haloacids from dissolving, rather than evolving to be detected, when detecting halogen ions?

Why is this? Given the strong contrast between the coastal tundra and the inland ice sheet, it seems to have something to do with the ocean, but the sea nonetheless always remains frozen on Greenland's north shore.

I live in the Eastern United States at the moment and we haven’t seen rain in about a month, is the lack of precipitation making us more susceptible? Is lack of rain also an effect of climate change? If so how?

Text: Mutations in DNA occur when DNA isn't copied quite right or is exposed to external influences, such as radiation. These mutations are then tested in the real world in what we call &quot;survival of the fittest.&quot; A mutation is more likely to be passed on to future generations if said mutation proves to be more beneficial than not. 

All of this I understand, but I'm having difficulty wrapping my head around &quot;spontaneous&quot; mutations. To me, it almost seems like these mutations are &quot;intentional&quot; rather than spontaneous. Is there anything inherent about DNA that ensures mutations occur so that evolution can occur as well? Did DNA itself evolve (for lack of a better word) in a way so that it produced mutations because that was somehow beneficial to its own survival? Or is it all truly spontaneous?

I've been doing some of my own research on this, but I guess I'm just confused as to how exactly mutations occur, and would really appreciate any clarification. Thanks!

Text: I’ve been trying to understand why the sky changes colors, and I think I understand most of it, but something in the online explanations doesn’t make it clear for me:

I’ve read:

- sky is blue because blue light gets scattered the most during the day. 

- in the evening it turns red because now even more of the blue light gets scattered

So a few questions:

1. The scattering of light during the day: does it mean that blue light gets reflected off air particles and reaches our eyes, while the rest of the frequencies pass through and reach the ground?

2. Surely some of the other frequencies also get scattered during the day, just in much smaller amounts?

3. So during the evening blue light gets scattered even more, to the point where even less of it reaches the eyes?

4. And so it gets red because now we can see the lower frequencies being scattered without blue overshadowing them?

5. Trying to word it myself: during the day only the highest frequencies get filtered, but during the evening also lower frequencies get filtered, because now the “light strainer” (air) is just catching more of it?

6. It gets darker in the evening without a good ability to see colors because there’s is no blue and so on light to reflect off of objects?

7. Is it ok to speak about light as a frequency? Or it’s only correct to say “wave length”?

Text: How did humans evolve lactose intolerance (lose the ability to digest lactose in adulthood)?   
I am not referring to how certain Eurasians, Africans, etc developed lactose tolerance in adulthood thousands of years ago. 

Instead, I am talking about how virtually all human babies are born lactose tolerant with the ability to product a lot of lactase enzymes to be able to drink and digest a lot of milk....but then a gene kicks in to turn off the lactase producing enzyme when they grow into older children/adults. Thus, I'm asking how and why the gene/traits/etc to turn off the lactase producing enzyme in adulthood evolved to create lactose intolerant adults when the default seems to be everyone starting out from a point of lactose tolerant babies.  


I've tried to research this myself, but everything I've found talks about how humans developed lactose tolerance in adulthood rather than how babies lost lactose tolerance when transitioning into adulthood.

My question is that do we potentially pass through some parts of the galaxy that have a positive or negative effect on our climate during those 230 million years? I find it hard to believe that we can orbit our sun (which is comparison to the galaxy is a tiny ball of fire) and have huge impacts on weather and growth etc. Yet being in a different point in the galaxy would have zero impact.

Text: In April 2023, [Reddit announced they would begin charging for its application programming interface (API)
access](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/18/technology/reddit-ai-openai-google.html).

API is used to allow different applications to interact with each other. We are a heavily moderated subreddit, and we use API access for moderation, AMA organisation, and insights into our community. We are using community-driven tools which use the API in order to make management of a community as large as /r/askscience practical for our group of volunteer moderators.

At the same time, we recognise both Reddit's mission as a corporation, as well as the dangers and risks arising from access to the API. Reddit is looking for ways to [monetize its user-generated content](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/upcoming-reddit-blackout-and-future-third-party-applications); the Times article linked above notes has been used to train high-profile machine learning models like OpenAI's.

While Reddit administration has mentioned [free access for moderation tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/141oqn8/api_updates_questions/), we believe their current approach of gatekeeping access based on arbitrary and indiscriminate rate limiting has several shortcomings:  
It disproportionately impacts people who use Reddit with accommodations, such as screen readers: Reddit has stated that [accessibility-focused apps will be exempt from the new restrictions](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/08/reddit-makes-an-exception-for-accessibility-apps-under-new-api-terms/) but has offered little clarity on what that means for this rapidly-approaching change  
It does not reflect Reddit’s promise to [support moderation
  tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/141oqn8/api_updates_questions/)  
It does not establish clear and concise criteria for what is legitimate API usage  

We also remain cognisant of Reddit’s past promises to [improve communication with
moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cbo4m/we_apologize/) and build tools for us to improve search and combat hateful rhetoric, anti-vaccination, and COVID denialism. While Reddit has banned hate speech and banned communities spreading science denialism, we feel they have not delivered on moderation tools and support. We feel that 3rd-party tools still offer superior support for moderation as well as accessibility features.

Everyone in the /r/askscience community contributes to its quality and longevity by volunteering their time and expertise to question, answer, and moderate scientific discussion. We feel the Reddit administration does a disservice our passion for large-scale, high-quality science communication by [pursuing a unilateral and opaque
direction](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/). This damages our community and ultimately Reddit itself by severing the trust we place upon it as a platform for science education and outreach.

Therefore, we have decided to join the protest beginning June 12. During this time, askscience will not be allowing new posts.  We anticipate being offline for 48 hours, and we thank you sincerely for your support and understanding.

Text: Hello! Complete science dunce here. I tried to find an article explaining but they all use terms I don't understand, so I figured I would come to ask people who know what they are talking about for a more helpful answer. 

I am reading one of Stephen Hawking's books and, as a complete airhead when it comes to physics and science I am struggling with the concepts. I turned to a youtube video to try and figure out what gravitational relativity was. I think I grasp most of it from the explanation and diagrams, but the one thing I can't wrap my head around is the section on Mercury.

It is said that the precession of Mercury proved Einstein's curved space theory using the equation. Now, obviously, the equation is complete nonsense to me and so that could be why I can't see the connection, but if it's something physical ('the curvature does xyz to Mercury which causes the precession!' etc) then please could someone explain?

TL;DR: Please explain how the unusual orbit of Mercury proves Einstein's curvature theory, but do it as though you're talking to an idiot.

Section of video I am querying: [https://youtu.be/tzQC3uYL67U?t=517](https://youtu.be/tzQC3uYL67U?t=517)

Text: When I say &quot;repeat&quot;, I'm not saying that Pi eventually becomes an endless string of &quot;999&quot; or &quot;454545&quot;. What I'm asking is: it is possible at some point that Pi repeats entirely? Let's say theoretically, 10 quadrillion digits into Pi the pattern &quot;31415926535...&quot; appears again and continues for another 10 quadrillion digits until it repeats again. This would make Pi a continuous 10 quadrillion digit long pattern, but a repeating number none the less. 

My understanding of math is not advanced and I'm having a hard time finding an answer to this exact question. My idea is that an infinite string of numbers must repeat at some point. Is this idea possible or not? Is there a way to prove or disprove this?

Text: Physics questions related to the speed of light and space travel

I am having difficulty finding answers to a few related questions regarding the speed of light and velocities in space:

Is there a maximum velocity if you have infinite fuel?

Person A measures the speed of light while on earth as ~298,000 km/s. Person B is traveling past earth at half the speed of light. Does person B measure the speed of light at ~149,000 km/s, or 298,000 km/s?

How is speed measured in space if all points of reference are also in constant motion? (Rather than fixed points of reference like here on earth). 

I know these seem like simple Q's, but I think there is more to them than an initial glance may suggest.

Looking forward to the ensuing discussion!

Image: [EGM96 geoid map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid#/media/File:Earth_Gravitational_Model_1996.png)

It places one of the highest areas in the northern part of the Atlantic ocean.

The gravitational map from the GRACE mission depicts gravitational acceleration  on the Earth's surface due to the same variations:

Image: [Gravity anomalies on Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth#/media/File:Gravity_anomalies_on_Earth.jpg)

It places an area of high acceleration in the northern part of the Atlantic ocean.

In fact, all of the high sealevel areas correspond to areas of high gravitational acceleration, and vice versa.

I would have expected the opposite.

Why is this so? I am assuming the images are correct. Why would higher gravitational acceleration lead to higher sealevels instead of pulling the water closer to Earth's center and leading to lower sealevels?

Text: I don't mean small/large scales as in molecules and galaxies.

I mean, if I were to expand to six times my size, but retain all the power of my limbs - like, my body strength *and my mass* is the same - would it feel exactly like gravity on the moon?

'Cause, I'm thinking, if I were 6 times my size, I could redefine &quot;one meter&quot; with respect to my own perspective (like, a meter is 0.56 of my height), and then I'd notice that things fall not at 9.8 m/s^2, but at 1.63 m/s^2. So it would for all intents and purposes appear to be like lunar gravity. Right?

Example: I drop an object from shoulder height. It takes about 1/2 second to hit the ground. If I'm six times taller, it'll take like 1.3 seconds, which is what it would take if I were normal height and standing on the moon.

(And people who make godzilla or ant man movies recognize this, and that's why everything is made to move like it's in slow motion? But that means that when ant man shrinks, it's like gravity is increasing - so he should be crushed when he shrinks.)

This feels like a dumb question, sorry. But I keep thinking about it.

Text: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-67860-3

The official position of the US government is that there is no evidence to support the idea of a causal link between solar activity and seismic activity. However, a paper published in Nature(linked above), demonstrates a statistically significant correlation between the two, with seismic activity picking up reliably after significant solar events. Given our current understanding of elctromagnetic fields within fault lines and large lava chambers, doesn't it stand to reason that massive electromagnetic storms could cause instability within those delicate systems and or precipitate seismic activity? Are geologists pursuing this line of reasoning? Could understanding this relationship help improve our ability to predict seismic and volcanic events?

Text: Since Feb 2022 Omicron has been the dominant variant, accounting for over 98% of sequences, [according to the WHO](https://www.who.int/news/item/16-03-2023-statement-on-the-update-of-who-s-working-definitions-and-tracking-system-for-sars-cov-2-variants-of-concern-and-variants-of-interest). OurWorldInData [paints a similar picture](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2020-03-01..latest&amp;facet=none&amp;country=USA~GBR~CAN~DEU~ITA~IND&amp;pickerSort=asc&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;Metric=Variants&amp;Interval=7-day+rolling+average&amp;Relative+to+Population=true&amp;Color+by+test+positivity=false). The table even shows 0% on all variants prior to Omicron in all countries as of Jun 2023. So have previous variants simply &quot;died off&quot;?

The usual explanation for this is that &quot;virus evolve&quot; and that Omicron is better at evading immune response, see the aforementioned WHO link. Although this may account for Omicron's success, it does not seem to account for the apparent demise of previous variants. Vaccination could explain it, but while it reduces the risk of transmission it does not eliminate it, so shouldn't the spread of previous variants be roughly proportional to the reduced transmission risk, instead of zero? Finally, if previous variants have indeed &quot;died off&quot; and vaccination *was* the answer, are vaccines targeting anything but Omicron still relevant?

Text: In space 'up' is relative but we can use the convention of Earth's northern hemisphere pointing 'up'. We could apply the same map convention to other planets, the Perserverence rover on Mars is in the northern hemisphere. 

Earth's magnetic pole between Canada and Russia is actually a *South* pole because the North Pole of a compass is attracted to it. We slipped up when naming these concepts before we fully understood them.

But what about other planets? Is the magnetic pole on Mars' northern hemisphere a magnetic south pole like Earth or a north pole? IIRC Earth's poles flip from time to time but what about the other planets?

Text: As a satellite orbits a planet (really, any massive body), does it need to rotate in order to stay oriented toward the planet's surface? For example, to keep its camera pointed at the ground.

I think this is probably a frame of reference thing, but it's really pushing the limits of my intuition.

Obviously, if one were to observe the orbit from a &quot;top-down&quot; perspective, the satellite would appear to be rotating, but is that still true from the satellite's perspective? If space time is curved, perhaps it's really travelling more or less &quot;laterally&quot; the whole time.

Maybe a different way to approach the question is, if the planet suddenly vanished, the satellite would be released on a straight trajectory like a stone from a slingshot, but would it be spinning?

Text: Hi reddit! We're members of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) Physics Frontiers Center, and for the last 15 years, we have been using radio telescopes supported by the National Science Foundation to turn a suite of millisecond pulsars into a galaxy-scale gravitational-wave detector. Millisecond pulsars are remnants of extinguished massive stars; as they spin hundreds of times each second, their &quot;lighthouse-like&quot; radio beams are seen as highly regular pulses. Gravitational waves stretch and squeeze space and time in a characteristic pattern, causing changes in the intervals between these pulses that are correlated across all the pulsars being observed. These correlated changes are the specific signal that we have been working to detect.

Our most recent dataset offers compelling evidence for gravitational waves with oscillations of years to decades. These waves are thought to arise from orbiting pairs of the most massive black holes throughout the Universe: billions of times more massive than the Sun, with sizes larger than the distance between the Earth and the Sun. Future studies of this signal will enable us to view the gravitational-wave universe through a new window, providing insight into titanic black holes merging in the hearts of distant galaxies and potentially other exotic sources of low-frequency gravitational waves. International collaborations using telescopes in Europe, India, Australia, and China have independently reported similar results.

Text: I asked Bard to tell the future about the next ice age, and it seems pretty plausible.

__________________________________________
The last ice age, which is also known as the Pleistocene Ice Age, began about 2.5 million years ago and ended about 11,700 years ago. During this time, the Earth's climate was much colder than it is today, and large ice sheets covered much of North America, Europe, and Asia.

It is possible that the Earth could enter another ice age in the future. However, this is not likely to happen anytime soon. The current climate is being warmed by human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels. This warming is offsetting the natural factors that would otherwise lead to an ice age.

Here is a story about how we could enter the ice age again:

The year is 2042. The world has been ravaged by climate change. Sea levels have risen, extreme weather events have become more common, and food shortages are a regular occurrence. In a desperate attempt to cool the planet, world leaders have agreed to a global ban on fossil fuels.

The ban has a dramatic effect. Within a few years, the Earth's climate begins to cool. Ice sheets start to grow, and the average global temperature drops. By 2070, the Earth is in the midst of a new ice age.

The ice age brings with it a new set of challenges. Crops fail, and food shortages become even more severe. People are forced to move to warmer regions, and conflict over resources breaks out.

But the ice age also brings some benefits. The air is cleaner, and the oceans are healthier. Wildlife populations rebound, and the Earth begins to heal.

In the end, the ice age is a reminder that we must take care of our planet. If we do not, we could face a future of even greater challenges.

This is just one possible story about how we could enter the ice age again. It is important to remember that the future is uncertain, and we cannot predict exactly what will happen. However, we can all do our part to protect the planet and avoid the worst effects of climate change.

Text: During undergrad we were taught the intermolecular forces model of solvation: like dissolves like, and by mirroring the intermolecular forces individual molecules will form solvation shells in the solvent. However this doesn't seem able to explain why polymers can be dissolved, where seemingly the solvent is breaking covalent bonds (say for example dissolving acrylic, methyl methacrylate, with acetone). Is the enthalpy from the heat of solvation able to break the covalent bonds? Or is it a misnomer to think of a polymer as being a single molecule composed of monomers (perhaps it's better described as an amalgamation of distinct, long chain polymers rather than a single molecular chain)?

I feel this relates to another question I have about solvents, which has to do with the formation of the solvation shell and the change in enthalpy. Is it perhaps that the solvation shell is a lower energy state, and thus the release of energy associated with solvation provides the energy to break the covalent bonds? This is the same mechanism behind dissolving ionic salts, right?

So sorry for the long rambling question, thanks for reading!

Text: Hello!

I've spent the past few weeks staring at the Hartree-Fock/Roothan-Hall algorithm, even implemented it in python. Even passed an exam on it with a Good Grade.

... Even look at its derivation using variational calculus.

And I still don't get it.

I know that the whole Exchange term arises due to the fact that we do the effective potential approach and wouldn't &quot;really exist&quot;.

However, the correlation term I can somewhat see in well, its name. Electrons move around in coupled ways, by having them move independently almost we introduce more coulomb repulsion than they would experience in reality. I can also kind of see how complete CI resolves this issue by taking a linear combination of wavefunction determinants - it kind of makes me think of thermostatistics and states.

But the Exchange interaction part I've no idea how to look at conceptually.

We... swap 2 electrons, which are supposed to be identical &amp; antisymmetric... and this leads to a somewhat significant decrease in effective potential? And then there's the closed-shell approximation where we do (2 * coulomb - 1 * exchange) due to spin cancellation.

Someone please help. I don't want to blackbox this.

Level is &quot;I just finished my 1st semester Structural &amp; Theoretical Chemistry MSc&quot;

p.s.: I am flairing this as &quot;Physics&quot; since the usual chemistry question focuses more on synthesis and bulk stuff and that maybe a proper physicist has an answer for me.

Text: I'm trying to look into ratios of 12CO2 in comparison to 13CO2 and 14CO2.I get the carbon dating mechanism pertaining to 14CO2 and how human intervention has changed the ratio of isotopes. What I'm struggling with, is understanding 13CO2 concentrations.

As far as I understand, the added weight of the extra neutron in 13CO2, causes 13CO2 to disperse slower than 12CO2, and causes it to need more energy to react - meaning the energy threshold for photosynthesis doesn't occur at the same rate. I get why this causes 12CO2 to be absorbed by plants at an increased rate - and for fossil fuels (mostly consisting of plant matter) to have vastly higher 12CO2 concentrations than 13CO2 compared to the ratio of 12:13 in the air.

What I don't understand, is how the ratio of 13CO2 can stay roughly the same (ignoring minor fluctuations) over time in an environment where we don't burn fossil fuels. Wouldn't there be increasingly higher rates of 13CO2 in the air - since a lot more 12CO2 is absorbed by plants, and neither 12CO2 nor 13CO2 decay because they are both stable isotopes?

How come 13CO2 levels don't steadily increase in the millions of years before humans started burning fossil fuels? Especially given how volcanic eruptions would further skew 13CO2 levels in comparison to 12CO2.

Text: From what I know, whether or not a celestial object can hold a certain gas in its atmosphere is dependent on three factors - its escape velocity, its temperature, and the gas in question. Due to gas laws, lower temperatures and higher escape velocities make it easier to hold on to gases, and heavier gases are easier for a planet to hold on to than lighter ones. When compared to Titan, Jupiter's moon Ganymede has a slightly higher temperature, which should hinder its ability to hold on to an atmosphere, but it also has a slightly higher escape velocity due to its higher mass and density which nearly cancels that out. So, similar to Titan, Ganymede should be able to support an atmosphere of heavy gases like carbon dioxide, and maybe some nitrogen and oxygen. However, Ganymede is almost completely devoid of any atmosphere, while Titan's atmosphere completely obscures the surface underneath and is more massive than even the Earth's. So why does Ganymede have no atmosphere while Titan has one?

Text: Hello Reddit! We are researchers at the National Institute of Health's Center for Alzheimer's and Related Dementia's (CARD) and National Institute on Aging (NIA). We are experts in data science and neuroscience working to advance dementia research. Today we're here to talk about a recent study published in *Neuron* that mined medical records to examine the link between viral illnesses and neurodegenerative disorders.

We will be here **Monday, July 10, from 2 p.m. - 3 p.m. ET (18-19 UT)** and look forward to answering your questions!


We are:

+ **Kristin Levine, M.S., - Advanced Analytics Expert Group, CARD**. I'm one of the lead authors on this study which helped identify links between virus infection and neurodegenerative diseases using health care data. My expertise is in data science and I have a special interest in health care, open science, and writing. I'm also a data scientist with Data Tecnica International.

Are there certain viruses that have known impacts significantly more than others?

For example, I've read that prior infection of EBV can be a major indicator for a higher risk of complications from certain conditions, or from longer-term impacts from other infections like Covid (I've seen this, purely anecdotally, in myself ~15yrs ago when it worsened my Ehlers-Danlos, compared to family members who didn't have a symptomatic EBV infection before). 

Anyway, sorry for the long rambling question. What is solidly understood? What is suspected? What is purely of interest to you that you get a chance to post here? I'm all ears and gratitude.

It is straightforward to derive the Planck length and Planck time; the values make intuitive sense as the smallest meaningful measures of these quantities. However, the Planck mass, 2.176 x 10\^-5 g, drops out of the same derivation and is obviously not the smallest amount of matter possible. What is the physical significance of the Planck mass? Is it the smallest possible mass of a micro black hole? Is it the mass that gives a Schwarzschild radius of twice the Planck length (math suggests it is?) Something else.

Thanks.

Text: I understand that, during the big bang, circumstances were hot enough that the four fundamental forces (strong, weak, electromagnetism and gravity) operated as one force. As the universe cooled, gravity then separated from this force and operated independently, followed by the strong force, with electromagnetism separating from weak somewhat later.

Is it possible that, as the universe cools as cosmic inflation continues, a force could split off from one of the others? Could magnetism, just by way of example, split off from electricity?

PostTime: 1689193331
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/14xzj6w/how_do_mirrors_work/
Text: My understanding of mirrors is that light hitting the mirrors causes the electrons in the atoms making up the mirrors to vibrate at the same frequency, causing them to emit photons in any direction. Then there is destructive interference in all directions other than the angle of reflection, which is what we see as the reflected light (Huygens–Fresnel principle).

But this seems to imply that the photons emitted are different, new photons compared to the photons that came in.

But my question then is how can the mirrors work in quantum experiment setups like the one used to test Bells Theorem? Does the photon pass its entanglement to the new generated photon? If it is polarization entangled, does this just mean the polarization quantum state must be copied to the new generated photon? How does this work? 

Also I thought entangled particles lose coherence when they interact with matter. Does the absorption and emmitance of a new photon not cause this to happen,

And for photons that are transmitted through the medium, are those the exact same photons?

Text: The most common explanation I've seen for hot air having a higher moisture capacity is that, as air heats, the pressure increases and thus, unconstrained, the density of the air decreases to equalize the pressure with the surrounding atmosphere. With fewer molecules of other gasses in a given unit of volume of hot air, there is more space for water molecules, so it has the higher capacity.

But what if the volume and density are maintained? If an air-tight container of air is heated, increasing the pressure without changing the density, would the water holding capacity still go up? Would it go down because of the increased pressure? Do the temperature and pressure cancel each other out exactly?

I have also learned that there are small structures in the skin called Ruffini endings, which detect warmth, and Krause end bulbs, which detect cold. But that's as far as I can find - having trouble finding information about how the process begins. 


My question is specifically what converts heat energy (or lack thereof) into a chemical signal? Is there an electrical pathway which becomes more/less conductive as the temperature changes, or maybe a protein somewhere is denaturing and triggering the release of some hormone?

At some point the mass of such an unfathomable amount of matter would collapse into a black hole right? So my question is, what is the absolute limit of the size of a star based on our current understanding of physics? Theoretically, how large (in comparison to our sun) and bright would that star be?

Text: As per title. I am a sociologist researching mental health and illness. I also have ADHD. Broadly speaking, with greater understanding of conditions such as ADHD, ASD, and others, we have begun to categorize them not as illnesses or defects but rather as naturally occurring variations of the human brain. The problem isn't with the brain per se, but rather that human societies are, broadly speaking, structures around the thought processes of neurotypical persons.

Has anything like neurodivergence been observed in wild animals? Things like, say, members of an animal pack being slow, or easily distracted, or irritable? My intuition is to say yes because some animals have rather complex social organization, which is necessarily based around a &quot;mental norm.&quot; But that's just a hunch, so I'm asking here for further sources.

Text: Information from video: The Demon Core was stored and transported in some kind of (lead?) container, I assume to protect those around it from radiation exposure.

Q1: Why wouldn't this container also cause criticality?  Surly the point of the container is to prevent radiation from &quot;leaking out&quot; so why wasn't it also causing nutrons to reflect back into the core.

Q2 If a container is necessary to prevent exposure how were the scientists able to move the core from the container to the experiment's equipment, i.e. the hemupheres. 

Q3  Is the amount of exposure from the core, in the timeframe of preparing and performing the experiment acceptable?  (Q3.1) If the core was sitting in a table in a room, could I walk into the room, and sit at the table without serious exposure?  Logic tells me this must be the case because scientists and assistants were doing exactly that, and everyone seemed to know that it was safe to be in the room during the experiments.

Q4 As the core reached criticality does the amount of radiation increase steadily 
, or does it remain at a safe (acceptable) level right up until the point of criticality where it spikes massively?

Q5.  (The last one.  Thank you for your patience). If the complete closure of the two hemispheres cause criticality, due to the reflection of the nutrons, why do those same spheres not prevent the radiation from &quot;getting out&quot;.  It seems contradictory to have total reflection **and** radiation leakage.

Thank you.

Text: **Please read this entire post carefully and format your application appropriately.**

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/10e3nfa/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxviii/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).
* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)
* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)
* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?
* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

\-------------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

`Username: /u/foretopsail`

`General field: Anthropology`

`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`

`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`

`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`

`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

Text: So basically I watched the video from Veritasium about the speed of the light or that it was only measured in both directions and not in one direction(https://youtu.be/pTn6Ewhb27k).   
In the video,  several failed attempts were also mentioned, e.g. a button that activates two  clocks,  one close to the laser, one distant to it, and stopping the  time when the laser hits the clock, the problem would be that the signal from the button may be unequal in one of the two directions and thus falsify   the result.   
Now my question, if you have a laser that reacts to a button and a clock that also reacts to a button, you align these two devices and then put a rod on these two buttons and then press the rod, then the clock should start when the laser is sent, since the signal no longer depends on the speed of light in different directions?    
Since I'm aware that I'm probably not the first with this idea, why doesn't it work?

(1) Yes, I understand that the &quot;sufficiently large quantity&quot; would have to be a very, very large quantity, but please don't get hung up on the (im)practicalities of the hypothetical. The point is just that it's all added in one place.

More like maybe vaginal ph or allergy to semen that gets better with a different partner. 

This is making the assumption that the members of the original couple are healthy with no infertility issues detected.

However, many professionals, including oncologists and dermatologists, state that exposure to sun rays leads to a higher risk of tumors, thus mortality, and the above studies just compare two bad habits and thus have no academic value.

I would like to know if there is a scientific consensus between the benefits and the risks of solar radiation, and if there are clearer publications on the argument.

Thank you in advance to everyone will answer my question

Text: For example, when the closest ancestor of the chicken gave birth to a mutated chick that would be the first chicken, who did that chicken breed with to create more chickens? Were others of the ancestral species giving birth to chicks with the same mutation?

EDIT: Thank you all for these enlightening explanations! I realize I fell for the human desire to make meaning out of the evolutionary process, when it is actually random and utilizes no intelligent thinking whatsoever. 

TL;DR: Defining a species (ie a chicken) is arbitrary in the grand scheme. It’s not a matter of the “sudden” birth of the first chicken but a multi-generational mess of coincidences.

Text: When the angle of incidence of light to a pv cell is less than 90 degrees, the effective area  is smaller, producing less power output.

By effective area i mean looking at a piece of paper head-on vs looking at it at a shallow angle- the latter makes the paper appear to have less area because of the angle to our eyes.

If this area could be kept constant, would power output still vary depending on the light's angle of incidence?

When I met my bf and he said he’s 178cm I didn’t believe him because there was obviously almost no difference between our heights. Well, we measured again, turns out he has indeed been exaggerating, he’s only 176, but also I did grow and am now 173cm tall. Is it possible I grew, maybe because I started to work out when I was 31yo? I’m pretty sure I don’t have a tumor in that gland that causes growing in adults, but is it actually common for people to grow when they start working out?

I'm not sure if this is a stupid question, but... shouldn't the average global temperature stay roughly the same? When the north is cold the south is hot, right? Do oceans make that big of a difference? Or is it something else?

Text: One thing I've noticed about the volcanoes on Io is that most of them, rather than building tall conical structures like stratovolcanoes or cinder cones, or vast mounds like shield volcanoes, they instead take on the form of structures known as patera, which are essentially giant, low-relief craters with steep walls which often are filled with lava lakes. Often the patera erupts via vents that reside either on the main floor or on the rim surrounding the volcanic crater. 

On Earth, the closest analog that we have here on our planet to the patera on Io is a volcanic feature known as the caldera, which forms when the volcanic vent collapses in on itself after a powerful eruption since the underlying magma chamber has been drained of magma to support the rock up above.

On Io, there have been features identified which can be considered shield volcanoes and thus can be viewed as true mountains, but they are much rarer than patera and tend to be smaller than the rest of the Ionian mountains.

Which brings me to my question, why is it that most Ionian volcanoes are unable to build up cones or shields and progress beyond just being what are essentially holes in the ground? Many of these volcanoes were able to pour out lava for years at a time and I've heard that the oldest of the active volcanoes were supposedly dated to be billions of years old which makes me wonder why they remained as huge depressions in the earth rather than building up cone or shield-shaped edifices like the ones found on Earth or Mar? Is it due to the composition of the lava? Or maybe because of the lower gravity of the moon as well as the lack of an atmosphere? Or could there be other reasons why that is the case?

Text: We know that the Earth is heating up, on average, due to climate change. We also know that this warming is primarily driven by the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as C02 and Methane. My understanding is that warming should be predictable and relatively constant with greenhouse gas emissions.

However, charts showing yearly temperature anomaly, which indicate a gradual trend in temperature increase year by year, also seem to show that 2023 is a shocking outlier. Sea ice reformation is a full month behind where it was last year, and I have been told that year-to-year increase in temperatures for June was so severe that it exceed the margins for uncertainty.

What is the cause of the strong warming of Earth this year? Was this predicted? Is this a sign of an accelerating trend?

I see that humans can survive in low humidity environments up to around 130F/55C, but when I'm looking, these places don't define &quot;low&quot; - I'm guessing it could be as high as 20% to 30%.

What sort of temperatures could a human in just about zero humidity survive? Is it still in that 55C range? Or could they go a bit higher?

Hi! I'm Sarah Kaplan, a Washington Post reporter covering climate science and the real-word effects of rising temperatures. My work for the Post has taken me all over the planet, from the [mountains of Peru](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2022/peru-climate-lawsuit-melting-glacier/?itid=ap_sarahkaplan) to the [sea ice off Alaska](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/science/arctic-sea-ice-expedition-to-study-climate-change/) to the [U.N. climate conference in Egypt](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/11/20/cop27-climate-conference-deal-fund/). This year, I traveled with my colleague Bonnie Jo Mount to [a unique lake in Canada that could soon become the symbolic starting point for a new geologic epoch: the Anthropocene](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2023/anthropocene-geologic-time-crawford-lake/). Researchers say that sediments from Crawford Lake in Milton, Ontario show how accelerating human activities -- including nuclear weapons testing and burning fossil fuels -- have fundamentally transformed the planet since 1950.



My name is Tim Patterson, and I am a Professor and Chairman of the Dept. of Earth Sciences at Carleton University, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.  The environmental geoscience research carried out by students and researchers in my lab is primarily focused on the study of paleo-lake records. We use of a variety of bioindicators, sedimentological, and geochemical techniques to study paleoclimate records, the impact of land-use change degradation on lake ecosystems, and the degree to which remediation and mitigation efforts are successful in improving lake systems.



I am a co-principal investigator, along with professors Francine McCarthy and Martin Head of Brock University, within &quot;Team Crawford&quot;, a group of over 40 researchers who have worked for the past five years to have Crawford Lake, Milton, Ontario, chosen by the Anthropocene Working Group (AWG) as the &quot;Golden Spike&quot; type section for the proposed Anthropocene Epoch.  A primary activity of researchers in my lab within the Crawford Lake research effort was to collect the freeze cores that captured the annually deposited layers (varves) that characterize the sediments of Crawford Lake.  A freeze corer is a metal tube with one or more flat faces that is filled with a slurry of dry ice and alcohol.  The corer is lowered into the sediment of a lake bottom where it is left for 30-45 minutes.  During this time the super chilled metal face(s) of the corer causes the adjacent sediment to freeze to the surface resulting in a perfectly preserved record of the sedimentary sequence.  Freeze coring was critical to the Crawford Lake coring effort, as this methodology is the only coring technique that can successfully be used to core the gassy and soupy sediments comprising the lake bottom.  Conventional cores collected from Crawford Lake tend to blow apart as cores are brought to the surface of the lake, where the pressure is lower and rapid degassing occurs.



All collected freeze cores are archived in the cold room in my lab and it was one of my students, Krysten Lafond, who established the critical annual resolution chronology for the annually deposited varves. Being able to precisely identify the AD 1950 base of the Anthropocene, was a prerequisite for any &quot;Golden Spike&quot; candidate.  Establishment of nuclear weapons atmospheric testing plutonium profiles, as well as industrially derived fly ash records (spheroidal carbonaceous particles) were two other prerequisite requirements established by the AWG for the successful candidate site, and all the subsampling work for these analyses was also carried out in my laboratory.  We also analyzed phytoplankton bioindicators from the lake at annual resolution to determine how the ecology of the lake responded to climate change and human driven influences (e.g. acid rain) through the 20th century.



Do you have questions about Crawford Lake, climate impacts or why some people think we've entered a new chapter in geologic history? We'll be here at **4 pm ET (20 UT)**. Ask us anything!

Text: I've been studying the Boltzmann's equation and understood the Entropy of a system is dependent on its number of microstates (compatible with the macrostate). I also understood the definition with discrete variables (like the coin toss example). My issue is when we apply the definition to something like a gas. A microstate defined by the positions and momentums of all the particles in it. The issue is that positions and momentums are continuous variables, therefore if a microstate is defined by all the variables at concrete and exact values, there must be an infinite amount of microstates for whichever macrostate of a gas. But that can't be correct because that would mean infinite entropy following Boltzmann's equation.

To summarize: how can we count a finite amount of microstates when each one is defined with continuous variables?

Text: I have long been aware of the 1.19km Barringer (Metoer) Crater in Arizona USA, which is commonly stated to be about 50,000 years old.

I have just found out that there are also two comparably sized meteor craters that cluster around 50,000 years old in China: a 1.8km crater in Xiuyan and a recently identified 1.85km crater in Yilan.

Is there any possible or suspected link between these craters? Could the events that formed them be related in any way?

&amp;#x200B;

Further complicating matters, I have also learned that there is a fourth known crater, Lonar Crater in India (also 1.8km)  , that was previously thought to be about 50,000 years old, but more recently found to be much older. To me this raises the question of the accuracy of the dating methods that have yielded an age of 50,000 years for the other three craters. Could dating methods just somehow have a bias towards yielding a result of 50,000 years?

  
Therefore, I see three possibilities:  


1. The craters are somehow related to each other
2. Their estimated ages are correct, but they are unrelated and entirely coincidental
3. Their estimated ages are incorrect, and they did not happen at approximitely the same time, and are therefore unrelated.

Text: For context, if it helps, I'm working on a fictional setting in which there is a large, circular mountain range (technically a very big/deep crater after some erosion). I want the climate to be relatively cold and am wondering how rain shadow would come into effect. My guess is that the center area (leeward) would be dry with the windward side having more snow and opportunity for taiga/boreal forests. Idk if I'm just not putting the right keywords into google but I'm struggling to find good info online.

Basically, I'm asking about how rainshadows present themselves in cold climates irl, and possibly if anyone has some examples I can look into.

Text: I was originally interested in physics, but I always had simpler explanations for complex things which I couldn't disprove based on my limited knowledge and remained unanswered. So I eventually gave up. This is one of the questions I had and was not able to find an answer to.

I also view quantum mechanics as deterministic rather than probablistic but think the probablistic approach is necessary because we cannot measure all the variables with our very limited measuring and processing capabilities. For example, a roll of die by a machine is deterministic if we measure and process everything from the light fluctuation in power, air movement in real time, mass of the die, initial position, curvature, area of contact, etc. but because that is too complicated we use it as random with a probability. I feel in quantum physics we are doing the same thing as it is simply more practical, but everybody I talk to truly believe I am wrong.

Coming to my question, in quantum mechanics the information cannot travel from piece A to piece B at faster than light to explain the correlation so it is seen as a weird phenomenon I think and at any time a piece can have any property but once the properties of a piece is measured the wave function will collapse and the properties of other piece becomes clear.

But isn't the correlation simply due to how the piece or particle was generated? No information needs to travel because the particle is simply continuing to react to the same generation event? If we can call it information isn't it already with all the particles or pieces of pineapples in air?

Text: We are scientists from Emory U. (/u/mcwoodruff) and Wellesley College (/u/kescobo) investigating the immunology and physiology of Long-COVID (also called &quot;post-acute sequelae of COVID-19,&quot; or &quot;PASC&quot;). We recently published [a paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-40012-7) where we show that there isn't just one disease, there are (at least!) two - one subset of which is characterized by inflammation, especially neutrophil activity, and patients with this version of the disease are more likely to develop autoreactivity (we creatively call this subset &quot;inflammatory PASC&quot;). The other subset (non-inflammatory PASC) is a bit more mysterious as the blood signature is a little less obvious. However, even in this group, we find evidence of ongoing antiviral responses and immune-related mediators of lung fibrosis which may give some hints at common pathways of pathology.

[Matt](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&amp;hl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;user=-oDHlFYAAAAJ) is an Assistant Professor at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. He has a PhD in Immunology and is currently spending his time building a fledgling lab within the Lowance Center for Human Immunology (read: we're hiring!). He has a background in [vaccine targeting](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2018.09.029) and [response](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20132327), [lymph node biology](https://doi.org/10.1038/ni.2965), and most recently, [immune responses to viral diseases such as COVID-19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05273-0).

Kevin is a senior research scientist (read: fancy postdoc) at Wellesley College. He has a PhD in immunology, but transitioned to microbial genomics after graduate school, and now spends most of his time writing code (ask me about [julia](http://julialang.org/)). His first postdoc was looking at the microbes that grow on the outer surface of cheese (it's a cool model system for studying microbial communities - [here's the paper](https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.22144)) and now does research on the human gut microbiome and its relationship to child brain development.

Text: The explanation I've always heard for why people seem to have often dramatically different experiences of pain to one another is either &quot;pain is subjective&quot; or &quot;people have different pain tolerances&quot;. The former is a non-answer and I don't accept that it's simply an issue of how much pain individuals are able to tolerate.

When I had my IUD inserted there was a sharp cramping pain for a second then it was over. It really was no big deal. I have known people to almost pass out from the pain. Some people who dislocate their shoulder might wince a bit but are perfectly able to carry on conversations, others with the same injury are unable to move or think.

That's not an issue of feeling differently about the same experience, that's people having completely different experiences/ sensations.

How much do we know about the physiological processes that cause us to experience pain? Why do seemingly the same injuries or experiences cause such dramatically different sensations or levels of pain in different people?

As modern humans interbred with other human species, it doesn’t seem ludicrous to me that it could have occurred with early chimpanzees and very archaic humans to

Text: I watched Minute physics video about it and he says that the gravity of the Moon is stronger the closer you are to it. Therefor the water on the near side of Earth to the Moon is pulled more strongly which creates a bulge on the near side.

 {This makes sense to me. The moon basically is canceling out some of the Earths gravity on the ocean nearest to the Moon.} 

Then he says the water on the far side is weaker so it isn't pulled as strongly which creates a bulge on the far side. This is the part I don't understand.

On the far side of the Earth, the Moon's gravitational force is weaker due to the greater distance. However, the Moon's gravity still acts on the water, pulling it towards the Moon. The effect is that the water on the far side gets compressed more into the Earth, with the combined gravitational forces of both the Earth and the Moon working together to compress the water on that side.
  

  
Some may argue that the Earth is being pulled away from the water on the far side more strongly than the ocean is, causing the ocean to bulge outwards in the opposite direction. However, given the size of the Earth and the relatively small size of the ocean, this effect must be minuscule. The land beneath the ocean and the ocean itself experience essentially the same gravitational force from the Moon.

How about a carbon decay in a larger molecule? Does the molecule break apart?

Text: I was watching this [Kahn Academy video](https://youtu.be/umvNQj-zmq4) on Earth's seasons (as someone in their 30s who still doesn't quite understand how seasons work does....) and I noticed, what appear to be, a couple crazy cosmic coincidences!

For one, Earth is in perihelion (the point in its orbit closest to the sun) in January, the same time as the southern hemisphere summer. So the southern hemisphere is getting the most energy from the sun at the same time the whole planet is closest to it!

For two, while this might otherwise result in a more intense summer for the southern hemisphere, this is moderated by the southern hemisphere having far more water than the north! That's some astronomical plot armor if you ask me! (but I don't have my own subreddit for that :(...)

Have I missed something here? Are these in fact coincidences or are they somehow related in some way?

I just see no reason why the two extremes of distance with the sun should correlate with the two extremes of our axis of rotation relative to the plane of our orbit around the sun. Nor any reason why the southern hemisphere should have more water than the north to conveniently(!) moderate the intensity of the summer experienced in the south.

Now, if the two objects were to zip by in 2 sets of parallel lines right next to each other, the relative velocity of the two objects would be 110 percent of the speed of light, because from the perspective of one of the objects, you are moving towards an object that’s moving to you as well at the same speed, multiplying your perspective of speed.

But since we know that nothing with mass can travel faster than the speed of light, this speed should be impossible to reach, bringing up my question of whether this is possible.

Title: I keep reading comparisons of todays weather to previous time periods, where it says that its the hottest month since some years ago. So was it just as hot or hotter before? If global warming is the cause today, what caused it to be that hot a 100 years ago? Why is today so much worse?

Text: Hello! I am familiar with the concept of the great squeeze and how that could eventually lead to our entire universe compressing back into a second big bang. All of this is to say, I understand that it is commonly believed we may not be living in the first universe at all, but perhaps the second, third, fourth, etc iteration of the Big Bang. My question is: what would have preceded the chains of big bangs, or what would have been before our big bang if not a preceding big bang?

I know that this isn’t a topic which has been “solved” by science. But are there any well known or well beloved guesses or theory’s?

Since it is in the Platycentrum section of Begonia, if it were to cross with a closely related but different monoecious species, would the resulting hybrid maintain its dioecy or revert to being monoecious? And could an F2 cross result in a mix of monoecious and dioecious offspring?

Text: The brain size of homo erectus increased significantly iirc, leading to the species of homo sapiens.
  

  
More intelligent individuals would obviously have a great advantage but wouldn't they also die significantly younger due to being the ones at risk from hunting? In turn meaning that they would reproduce less when compared to the individuals who are dumber (who haven't gotten the mutations for genes that increase brain size).
  

  
Maybe they were actually not in danger more than their peers whether because of extensive tool use and hunting techniques. But then the original question would apply to earlier species who had even less tools.
  

  
Am I missing something?

Text: I am curious about gene editing and technology behind it, and to see it’s full potential in all fields of what could be. Most stuff I find about it online confuses me

1) if we have the human genome mapped, does this mean we know what each gene does and all of the functions of each and every gene?  If not, then what did completing human genome even mean?  is it possible to learn them all now ?

2) can gene therapy such as crispr still be successful and safe without knowing all of the things listed above? 



3) when will gene editing technologies such as Crispr be mainstream, widely available and for anything genetic disease, autoimmune, allergies, cancer or no matter how mild [benign skin condition such as keratosis pilaris ]or for something very serious, where it is easily curable and accessible to almost all? 

4) when will gene editing be available for those who wish to do things such as anti aging, reverse gray hair, change eye color, and make adults even taller [this would be a huge opportunity and industry as humans are very vain] as well as fixing things such as bad muscle insertions, and muscle asymmetry etc which is purely genetic and there is currently no treatment for. Could it even replace plastic surgery?

Text: I'm not a hydrologist but am a little familiar with in situ measurement of soil moisture, specifically by measuring these proxies:

* Electrical permittivity (approximately proportional to the water content, but inserting the sensor disturbs the soil possibly affecting measurements)
* Electrical resistivity (more complicated relationship to water content that depends on soil composition and temperature; can be done without disturbing the soil)
* Soil suction/tension/matric potential (again, depends on soil composition)

In general, measuring soil water content accurately seems to be not especially easy to do at large scale, especially if the soil's composition is variable or not well known.

So when we see continental-scale maps of soil moisture (e.g., [this](https://nassgeo.csiss.gmu.edu/CropCASMA/)) how are they measured, and how accurate are they?

Text: I’ve seen a fair number of TV documentaries of surgeons at work stitching two veins together when, for example, replacing an organ in a transplant. Frustratingly, these documentaries tend to avoid the detail, leaving me wondering how a couple of tiny stitches in miniature tubes can work. If I joined together two pieces of hosepipe, I’d need quite a bit more than a sewing kit for the join to be effective!

Edit: Many thanks for the responses, folks. It’s clear in my mind now. The documentaries I saw gave a bad impression of the number of stitches involved, probably to do with poor editing of the procedures and commentary.

So I am asking, if the plates are constantly moving, does that mean they are in different locations now when compared to where they where millions of years ago?

Or is the range of mountain formation of two plates colliding covers much more ground than just the exact point of collision?

My guess is that they knew there were elements that appeared similar, but had slightly different masses, so they numbered them without knowing exactly why yet.

Text: Edit: Hi mods!  This question is about the physics of high velocity impacts, not planetary science.  Thanks!

If I throw a ball into a sandbox, the impact shape will very much reflect the impact angle. Same with a ball of mud into a pile of mud (where the impacting object stops being an object due to the impact).

But the same is not true of astronomical impacts. The craters are more or less symmetrical without regard to angle. And I think they're also the same size and depth no matter the impact angle?

Also, as a secondary question: when does this feature change happen? At what impact speed? Is it sudden or gradual as speed changes?

I've also seen that simulation of the earth being struck by the mars sized body which formed the moon, which I assume is at a similar delta V as a meteor impact, but it's very much not symmetrical.

Text: Hi Reddit! We're Casey Burleyson, Jeff Dagle, and Nathalie Voisin from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. We're here today to answer questions about how climate change-specifically, extreme heat and drought-affects our nation's electrical grid.

Extreme heat can damage transmission equipment and lead to life-threating wildfires. In times of extreme heat, utilities may have insufficient generation, resulting in the need to turn off power to customers and leading to rolling blackouts. Sometimes significant fire danger, such as high wind, can lead to power system safety shutoffs. Heat and drought can also affect hydropower by decreasing the water available to flow through dams.

Researchers at PNNL are tackling these challenges and studying ways to improve the reliability and resilience of the grid, including advising utilities how to prepare for disasters, studying the complicated task of integrating renewable energy into the grid to offset fossil fuel emissions, and developing better forecasts for hydropower operators so every drop of water that flows through a dam can generate energy.

[Casey Burleyson](https://www.pnnl.gov/people/casey-burleyson) is an earth scientist who works on simulating climate impacts on the electrical grid. A meteorologist by training, Burleyson uses his expertise to model how extreme temperatures from heat waves and cold snaps impact electricity demand.

[Jeff Dagle](https://www.pnnl.gov/experts/jeff-dagle) is chief electrical engineer for electricity resilience who has been at PNNL for 34 years. He studies ways to make the power grid more resilient, including from natural disasters like fires, storms, earthquakes, and more. This involves not just protecting equipment itself, but also studying strategies to keep the complex grid distributing power to customers even in the event of component failures and other disruptions.

On the hydropower side, [Nathalie Voisin](https://www.pnnl.gov/people/nathalie-voisin) is chief scientist for regional water-energy dynamics, studying how management of our nation's water affects power availability on the grid. Her work includes helping to improve watershed forecasts that inform utility management and studying how climate change will affect water availability for energy in the future.

We'll be on at **10 AM Pacific (1 PM ET, 17:00 UTC)** to answer your questions. Ask us anything!

Text: Venus's atmosphere is super dense, &gt;90x the density of earth's atmosphere, and &gt;90% of it is CO2. there's a little bit of nitrogen in there (like 2-3%), but from what I've read it's actually a similar amount of nitrogen as in the earth's atmosphere (which is like 75% nitrogen).

on earth we have very little CO2, but a lot of carbon (in rocks and in the biosphere).

so I was wondering, if you just tally up the amount of N, O, and C (etc) - apart from the chemicals they find themselves in - how similar are the Earth &amp; Venus?

But then he said “all principle sources of gravity in our solar system are present and accounted for.” That’s a very definitive statement, how does he know this?

I recently read that Proxima Centauri takes \~550,000 years to complete its orbit with Alpha Centauri. That’s an unfathomable amount of time for my human brain. Plus humans only evolved \~300,000 years ago. So how can he be so certain that there is no significant/large object 13,000 AU from our sun that takes half a million years to orbit. Is this just a semantic argument on what a solar system is?

Text: For context, my question comes from a science-fiction novel in which two characters abandon a crashing spaceship as it comes into a planet’s atmosphere. One character notices that the planet’s sunrise is just cresting one horizon as they begin their fall. As the fall progresses, the sunrise completes and they finish their fall in full daylight. Of course I wouldn’t expect a sci-fi author to know all the physics of such a thing, but it got me wondering how such an event would actually play out. If an object begins a descent at a point very high above earth, such as that Red Bull guy who skydived from a balloon on the edge of space, will it descend at a true vertical, or land some distance to the West as the earth rotates below it? This is assuming we’re discounting other forces like wind and such. I tried googling an answer but everything I found was too science-jargony for me to understand lmao.

Text: I was watching a video on harrowing bruin encounters on YouTube and the narrator mentioned on one scene that the bear must've been attracted to the scent of a picnic. He also mentioned that he picked up on this scent from miles away. Smelling, to my understanding, works by tiny bits of whatever we're smelling binding to olfactory receptors in our noses. I imagine the process works the same way for bears and another animals blessed with super sniffers, just more potently since they have stronger olfactory receptors.

Would this not mean that the scent, aka the tiny bits of the substance, would have to be buoyed along the air over miles and just so happen to hit the bear's nose? How is it that they can smell anything that far? Do their noses somehow pull in these scents?

Text: Question in the title.  As I understand it, heating water increases it's ability to dissolve things. Just as how you boil water with sugar and as the water cools, it's supersaturated and can form rock candy. 

So, using that logic, cold water from the municipal line could have some dissolve sediments but heating that water would increase the carrying capacity (don't know the actual term) and allow the now hot water to carry even more. So, taking that further, one would think that the hot water tank would be the cleanest part of the plumbing... The water is able to accept all sorts of dissolved stuff. But clearly that isn't the case in reality. Why is that?

Molecular Engineering is a new field; we were one of the first Molecular Engineering graduate programs to appear in the world, and one of only two in the United States. Though our program only began in 2014, we have had many discoveries to share!

Molecular engineering itself is a broad and evolving field that seeks to understand how molecular properties and interactions can be manipulated to design and assemble better materials, systems, and processes for specific functions. Any time you attempt to change the behavior of something by precisely altering it on a molecular level - given knowledge of how the molecules in that &quot;something&quot; interact with one another - you're engaging in a type of molecular engineering. The applications are limited only by your imagination!

Molecular engineering is recognized by the National Academy of Engineering as one of the areas of education and research most critical to ensuring the future economic, environmental and medical health of the U.S. We would like to spread awareness about its applications, as well as the exciting opportunities that come with it.

As a highly interdisciplinary field spanning across the science and engineering space, students of Molecular Engineering have produced numerous impactful scientific discoveries. We specifically believe that Molecular Engineering could be an exciting avenue for up-and-coming young scientists, and thus we would like to broaden the general awareness of our discipline!

Text: Foods like shrimp and crab are almost never eaten raw in the US, and recipes for mussels, clams etc always specify that the animals must be alive when cooked, which is never done with real fish. There is a perception that shellfish are very prone to spoilage. Sushi restaurants that feature raw fish rarely feature raw shrimp.

On the other hand, oysters are often eaten raw, and in Japan raw crab and shrimp are not unheard of, so I'm not certain if this is even true or if it's just an American idiosyncrasy.

Is it actually true, and if so, what is the cause?

Text: I was thinking about the probability of life on other earth-like planets. I started by imagining a planet identical to earth but with no life. How likely is it that life emerges? I then realized that, as far as I know, life only came about one time on earth and then evolved into every living thing on the planet. That idea strikes me as strange and unintuitive. Earth, thanks to its abundance of life, is now covered in the primordial building blocks of life. Why did it only start once? Are we sure it only started once here? I’ve tried to research this question before but can’t find much.

Text: Had a good spirited debate today with a buddy about this as he's under the impression that all species (as long as we have the DNA) can be brought back into existence utilizing genetic engineering. He mentioned stuff like cloning and crispr. Now I don't know Jack about this stuff but I argued that not all species can just be brought back to existence, primarily for the fact that DNA degrades over time, then there's the fact that if you were to bring back an animal from extinction I think you'd have to do that with an animal that has a similar genetic match (I'm just working off of some basic knowledge here that I've learned here and there from college) also the idea that all animals can be brought back from extinction assumes that there are scientists globally who are actively collecting and storing all DNA samples of those animals (not asserting that this doesn't happen in any capacity moreso my case is that it's not happening at a scale where ALL animal's can be brought back from extinction).

Main problem here is that neither of us are Genetic Engineers/Scientists of any form. It was hard searching for info about this on the Internet without a bunch of conspiracy stuff.

Can some people who are knowledgeable on the subject give me some supporting answers/evidence for what the actual truth of the matter is?

Text: I'm not well versed in geology so maybe I have some mistaken assumptions, but it seems like the surface of mars is pretty similar over the whole planet - rather &quot;soft&quot; red rock everywhere, a general lack of the types of mountain peaks on earth and so on. On earth you see a wide variety in landscape types due to different forms of rock. Even looking at a map of earth, some parts of it are red like in Australia and the sub-saharan desert around Namibia, others yellow such as the Arabian and Saharan deserts, and some grey like the northern tips of the British Isles and Canada. You also get jagged peaks like the European alps and then heavily eroded mountains like the great dividing range or Ural mountains.   


What are the factors behind Mars' apparent geological uniformity in comparison to earth?

Some people in the &quot;southern portions of Western NY&quot; also felt it, though, which to me was pretty surprising, as locations closer in OH didn't report feeling it, at least not enough to make news.

So, it seems to me the &quot;feel&quot; of the earthquake has a sort of directional effect to it. What are the mechanisms where this sort of thing would happen? ie, does it follow fault lines we/I cannot see on a map somewhere? Is it bedrock formations that are shared, that pass it along (ie, being on basically the same shale plate)?

Text: Mt Shuksan is over 100 million years old.  But nearby Mount Baker, a volcano, is closer to 100,000 years old.  

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question is, if Shuksan was formed due to plate collisions, wouldn't the plates have moved over that long time period, causing the formation of Baker to be elsewhere?  

&amp;#x200B;

Compare to the Hawaiian islands and the Emperor Seamounts.  Wikipedia says the oldest of these is &quot;only&quot; 81 million years, and the islands span something like 4,000 miles.  Why isn't Baker thousands of miles away from Shuksan?  Or has plate motion &quot;brought&quot; the formation of Baker to that spot over the eons?

The heat would move through the air and instantly kill the characters even if they are not touching the lava directly, simply by being near an object of such immense heat.

Why doesn't the same thing happen to welders when they are welding? The weding flame is much hotter than lava. How are welders protected from convection?

Text: Animals that are poisonous tend to stick out visually. I usually see people claim this is evolved as a &quot;warning&quot; to other animals. If that's true, wouldn't the other animals have to evolve to recognize bright colors as a warning too? Also couldn't non-poisonous animals evolve to have bright colors so they trick predators into thinking they are poisonous? The bright colored thing never really made much sense to me, but it seems like lots of animals that have poison are usually colorful.

Text: Hello,

I am not sure to ask my question in the right place because I am writting something for a sci-fi story, but I need to understand some things. I would like to create a planet which has a day/night cycle of 12 hours. I found on the internet that only the speed rotation of the planet or its axis of inclination can affect the duration of the cycle.

So my questions are : Is it true ? Are there any other factors ? 

I was wondering if the size of the planet, its distance from its sun or the number of satellites are also some factors that could effect the day/night cycle's duration.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your time, and sorry if I'm not in the right place for this question (If I'm not, do you know where I shoul ask ?)

Seems to me that some huge surface area lake, if only inches deep for example, would simply evaporate away.    


[My googling found this paper](https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/148413/Lake%20surface%20area.pdf?sequence=1) (PDF warning!) and while it isn't exactly what I'm asking about, it seems to suggest a minimum depth for the &quot;thermocline&quot; based (at least partially) on surface area.

I'm assuming it would be all but impossible to single out one or multiple moons around a rocky planet hundreds of light years away, but whenever I see an announcement of a new exoplanet &quot;nearly&quot; the size of the Earth, there never seems to be any doubt that it's a singular planet, as opposed to a binary system like our own. 

Granted, I think the moon is like 1/80th the mass of Earth, so if an alien observer viewed earth through a telescope similar to our own, the size of our earth probably wouldn't be swayed all that much by the presence of a moon, but who's to say all binary systems have such size discrepancy between them? Is it just basic physics that disallow such systems to exist for long periods of time?

Is there a possibility that a lot of the &quot;larger&quot; rocky planets with twice the mass of our earth could, in fact, be a system consisting of a planet closer in size to our own, but with one or multiple moons?

Text: Hi, I'm Prosanta, and I'm excited to answer all the questions you have about evolution (but have been afraid to ask). I think the science of evolution remains controversial among the general public (not among scientists) because the topic hasn't been explained very well and the facts are often misunderstood. After moving to Louisiana from New York City, where I grew up, the Governor of my adopted state, Bobby Jindal, passed a law that allowed public school teachers to introduce non-science (including religious) perspectives as alternatives when teaching evolution and other scientific topics. That's when I started to write my new book Explaining Life Through Evolution.

With the teaching of evolution being recently removed or banned from places like India and Türkiye (formally known as Turkey), and with more and more people learning about their ancestry from DNA tests, and with new gene editing tools like CRISPR becoming available, I think it is more important than ever that everyone understand evolution. The consequences of not understanding evolution have led to the promotion of racism and eugenics that are not in line with the science.

I'm here from (**2-4pm ET, 18-20 UT**) so ask me about [evolutionary misconception that just won't go extinct](https://bigthink.com/life/great-chain-being-evolutionary-misconception/) or about why we are [more fish than monkey](https://www.ted.com/talks/prosanta_chakrabarty_four_billion_years_of_evolution_in_six_minutes?language=en) or about [the roots of our 'Tree Of Life'](https://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/evolution-explaining-life-book/).

Text: On face value, it seems to me a parasitic relationship is unstable because of the parasite's conflicting interests. On the one hand, it has to drain the host for food/reproduction. On the other, it can't kill the host (too early) because it depends on it for survival. 

But if this is true, then parasitic relationships would have the tendency to break down or evolve into symbiotic ones, right?

Text: *edit* thanks all for the responses, I have learned some things here, this was very helpful.

Question background:

&quot;Uniqueness&quot; is a concept in mathematics: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniqueness_theorem

The example I know best is of Shannon information: it is proved to be the *unique measure* of uncertainty that satisfies some specific axioms. I kind of understand the proof. 

And I have heard of other measures that are said to be *the unique measure* that satisfies whatever requirements - they all happen to be information theory measures.

So, part 1 of my question: is &quot;uniqueness&quot; a concept restricted to IT-like measures (the link above says no to this *specifically*)? Or is it very general, like, does it makes sense to say that there's a unique function for *anything* measurable? Like, is f = ma the &quot;unique function&quot; for measuring force, in the same sense as sum(p log p) is the unique measure of uncertainty in the Shannon sense?

Part 2 of my question is: how special is uniqueness? Is every function a unique measure of *something*? Or are unique measures rare and hard to find? Or something in-between?

Text: I was pouring a drink lately, and added a truly godless amount of ice cubes when I noticed they quickly flowed to the side of the glass. But it's just flat water (well, lemonade in this case, but I've tried it with water too), there's no current or obvious circulation. So why do the ice cubes stick to the outside?

Text: First law of thermodynamics is often written as ΔU = Q - W where ΔU is the change in internal energy of the system, Q is added energy as heat, and W is the work the system does on the surroundings. 

There are other ways to write this formula/law. One of them is dU = δQ - δW, which I don't understand. The &quot;δ&quot;s in front of &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;W&quot; makes sense, since we are referring to infinitesimally small transitions of energy, as heat and work. But why the &quot;d&quot; in front of &quot;U&quot;? This &quot;d&quot; has nothing to do with differentiation, so why not use &quot;δ&quot; here as well? 

Lastly, I've seen people use the term ΔQ in other equations in thermodynamics. Since &quot;Q&quot; is already a change of something (correct me if I'm wrong), what's the point of the &quot;Δ&quot;? If we compared the heat added/removed from a system in 2 different scenarios, it kinda would make sense to talk about the difference in heat added/removed, but that's not how my teacher used the term ΔQ. They used it to reffer to &quot;change in the heat of the system&quot;. I thought heat wasn't a property a system has.

Text: I guess this is just a question about terminology. How do scientists describe how heavy something is on the moon? Do they talk about it in terms of &quot;Earth kilograms&quot;? Do they mix measurement systems and use imperial pounds to talk about weight and metric kilograms to talk about mass? Or do they just not talk about this haha.

Text: I was watching a curator explain the history of a 17th century marble table and she mentions that &quot;86 of the 97 species of the marble can no longer be mined&quot;, making it efficiently &quot;extinct&quot;. What exactly does that mean? 

Wouldn't there be pockets of the same type of marble that occur over a range of area? 
One type of marble the website mentions is &quot;Portoro&quot;, where the quarry is owned by the Vatican but that still leaves 85 others that we collectively no longer have access to. Do different types of marble form in a very specific concentrated way?

Here is the link: https://rauantiques.com/products/the-manheim-marble-specimen-table

My apologies since this might be considered a product but it does have a unique history and contains relevant context for the question. Thank you for your help.

Text: Given (P1 x V1) /T1 = (P2 x V2) / T2, and making p and v = 1 on both sides, and, finally, measuring the air temp in Kelvin, given an input temp of 293, or room temp, shouldn't the temp of the air in the vacuum cleaner be 234.4 if the vacuum cleaner achieves a 20% drop in pressure, which Wikipedia alleges it does? Cite here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum\_cleaner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_cleaner) 

Quote: &quot;For example, a typical domestic model has a suction of about negative 20 kPa.\[citation needed\] This means that it can lower the pressure inside the hose from normal atmospheric pressure (about 100 kPa) by 20 kPa.&quot;

This means a 20% drop. If I multiply 293 \* .8, I get 234.4. That's pretty cold. So does the temperature of the air inside a vacuum cleaner drop proportionately to the drop in pressure, and if so, why isn't it frosty cold?

Silly question, I know, but it's a rainy Sunday with not a lot to do, so I'm just knocking around with random thoughts...

Text: When we say that the temperature of a glass of water is 30 degrees centigrade, that actually means that the average temperature of the liquid is 30, but there is a large variation of temperatures within the glass, hence why water still evaporates despite being well below the temperature for evaporation to occur.

So when we stick a finger into the 30 degree water, why are we not getting mini scalds all the time from the areas that are much higher temperatures than the average of 30 degrees?

Text: So is it not with me as with that muse,
 Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,
 Who heaven it self for ornament doth use,
 And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,
 Making a couplement of proud compare
 With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems:
 With April's first-born flowers and all things rare,
 That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
 O let me true in love but truly write,
 And then believe me, my love is as fair,
 As any mother's child, though not so bright
 As those gold candles fixed in heaven's air:
 Let them say more that like of hearsay well,
 I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
