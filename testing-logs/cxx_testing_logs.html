Text: **Please read this entire post carefully and format your application appropriately.**

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/s93rpe/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxvi/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).
* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)
* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)
* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?
* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

\-------------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

`Username: /u/foretopsail`

`General field: Anthropology`

`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`

`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`

`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`

`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

You can submit your application by replying to this post.

Text: Would it just go out? Like, poof, it’s gone? Would it solidify into something? Would all the water vaporize? I feel like it would all vaporize but it’s the same amount of water as there is sun, so it just feels like it *couldn’t* all vaporize, y’know? 

Also how much water would it take to “put out” the sun?

Text: Per my research, it is consumed in Mexico, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Italy, Morocco, Indonesia, and even parts of the US! But isn’t this dangerous? Rather, it seems like the bulk of vCJD cases were in the UK in the 90s from eating normal muscle meat. Of course I’m certainly happy that it is extremely rare (hopefully to the point of extinction).

Text: We know that the moon's gravity affects the tides and things, so how does it affect the magma below the surface of the earth? Does the moon's movement affect how volcanos and how much lava is being built up with them? Does the moon's movement then affect the movement of the tectonic plates?

Those are all the basic questions that I could get to through my very limited knowledge of how the moon affects tides and things.

Text: Good morning askscience guys, I have a question that I've been thinking about for years.  To the point, physiologically the human being has mechanisms to regulate acid-base control, and among them is pulmonary ventilation, in case the blood turns to a more acidic pH, the body generates hyperventilation to regulate the pH.  Otherwise, hyperventilation produces alkalosis.  So here is my question, dogs in hot weather or extreme exercise hyperventilate and do so a lot.  How is it that dogs regulate blood pH quickly without suffering alkalosis when they start hyperventilating?  I appreciate your response in advance, thank you very much.

Text: I have been thinking about trying some new ear plugs for concerts and really want to protect my hearing. 
**Do the high fidelity ones truly protect your ears better or do they just sound better than foam ear plugs that block more sound? My goal is hearing protection even if it cost some sound quality.**

What’s the difference between high fidelity ear plugs (Eargasm, Downbeats, Flare, etc.) and Mack’s foam ear plugs? 
Mack’s block out 32dB-38dB while most of the high fidelity brands I see only block 18-21 dB?

I understand you can supposedly hear the music clearer with the high fidelity plugs, but it let’s in more noise which seems like that would be more likely to damage your ears.

Thanks!

Text: Would it just go out? Like, poof, it’s gone? Would it solidify into something? Would all the water vaporize? I feel like it would all vaporize but it’s the same amount of water as there is sun, so it just feels like it *couldn’t* all vaporize, y’know? 

Also how much water would it take to “put out” the sun?

Those are all the basic questions that I could get to through my very limited knowledge of how the moon affects tides and things.

Text: Good morning askscience guys, I have a question that I've been thinking about for years.  To the point, physiologically the human being has mechanisms to regulate acid-base control, and among them is pulmonary ventilation, in case the blood turns to a more acidic pH, the body generates hyperventilation to regulate the pH.  Otherwise, hyperventilation produces alkalosis.  So here is my question, dogs in hot weather or extreme exercise hyperventilate and do so a lot.  How is it that dogs regulate blood pH quickly without suffering alkalosis when they start hyperventilating?  I appreciate your response in advance, thank you very much.

Text: I have been thinking about trying some new ear plugs for concerts and really want to protect my hearing. 
**Do the high fidelity ones truly protect your ears better or do they just sound better than foam ear plugs that block more sound? My goal is hearing protection even if it cost some sound quality.**

What’s the difference between high fidelity ear plugs (Eargasm, Downbeats, Flare, etc.) and Mack’s foam ear plugs? 
Mack’s block out 32dB-38dB while most of the high fidelity brands I see only block 18-21 dB?

I understand you can supposedly hear the music clearer with the high fidelity plugs, but it let’s in more noise which seems like that would be more likely to damage your ears.

Thanks!

Text: I was reading the results of a family member's recent genetic test and there are an astounding number of genotype-disease links that they check for. I was wondering if there is some sort of standard of evidence that each of these links has to meet before they are taken seriously and tested for or if there is really no standard and that direct-to-consumer genetics companies (like 23andMe) just offer tests for any possible disease even if the evidence is questionable.

Are all of these links established the same way? I imagine one way would be to trace the biochemical pathway from certain DNA sequence all the way to the proteins they produce and see if the the resulting proteome would result in disease (for example, I think [this is possible](https://sickle-cell.com/causes#:~:text=figure%201%3A%20hemoglobin%20s%20(hbs)%20genetic%20and%20phenotypic%20mutations) for sickle cell anemia). But I imagine the other, (and less reliable?) way would be to look at people with diseases, look at their genomes, and the form statistical correlations, ie. &quot;most people with this disease have this genetic variant, so we will assume this genetic variant and this disease are linked&quot;.

Text: A few months ago my wife and 7 year old son were bed bound with what we presumed to be influenza with typical symptoms of hhigh temperature,  dry cough, aching body, fatigue, difficulty sleeping.  A few of my wife's friends also had it and although it was self diagnosed we all tested negative for covid so it seems a good guess.  Meanwhile my 3 year old never had any symptoms and I had a mild cough and felt a bit achy but wasn't anything close to bed bound and was happy working, cooking, cleaning and even managed a couple of 10 mile bike rides (my usual route is 15 miles but I felt a bit tired).  In fact at 44 years old I have never been bed bound for more than a morning.

Most people tend to say if you can get out of bed it's not flu, but is that true or can you have flu and have no/ mild symptoms?

****Obviously I'm aware it was self diagnosed and it may be none of us had flu but had something else, I'm just interested if flu is always as bad as people say.

Text: Assume a person weighs 100kg. They then have a limb immobilized due to injury or other causes, which results in muscle loss from that limb. If their TDEE (total daily energy expenditure, or base metobolic rate + calories burned from activity) remains the same as it was before the muscle loss, will they lose weight? or just lose muscle while maintaining the same weight?

Intuitively I would think that there would either be no change to the persons weight, or maybe even a slight increase since muscle burns more calories at rest than fat which would result in a lower BMR/TDEE. Unless there is some change to metabolism, if calories in = calories out before and after the muscle loss, we would expect no or little weight loss.

Is this assumption correct? why or why not? And if it is, where does the mass that was previously caused by muscle end up?

Is the CO2 in those productions, added to Chinas total CO2 emissions.

Title: When footprints of prehistoric humans or even dinosaurs are found, how does it happen that the ancient mud or sand in which they walked was fossilized and yet, in all the intervening time, the footprints were not filled in and erased by additional layers of mud that also turned to stone?

Some articles are saying you must cook meat to prevent food born illnesses and some saying yes in moderation. But the articles seem to lean one way or another, not just a “it depends.”

Text: I saw a post recently about people who have no internal monologue (aphantasia) and it got me thinking about my own personal mental experience and how so much of my depression and anxiety come in the form of a discouraging internal monologue.  
This made me wonder if people with aphantasia experience things like depression at all, in lower numbers, or if they simply experience it differently. Surely if you have no voice in your head to telling you you're worthless then you must be free from the negative feelings it causes. I would also think the the same would apply to various other mental disorders.  
Is there any correlation between having aphantasia (or not) and susceptibility to mental illness?

While they seemed to thrive elsewhere, they eventually went extinct in the Americas until being reintroduced by Europeans in the 1500s.  Since then, wild horse populations have again thrived in the new world.  So, why were they wiped out, and why did this not effect Eurasian horses?

Text: Last April, I was visiting family in Florida when a friend, who works in health care, showed me a memo that she received from the state Department of Health, offering scientific explanation for why gender-affirming care should be denied to children in the state.

I started clicking the links in the memo, and reading what the evidence they were citing actually said. It seemed like they were using those citations in bad faith-that the science actually said something other than what the state said the research says.
And so, I reached out to to the doctors whose work Florida was holding up as rationale for banning transgender medicine for minors. Ten doctors all told me that they didn't know Florida was citing their work - and that Florida is distorting their scientific work to push an anti-transgender (and anti-science) agenda.

Earlier this month, my colleagues at VICE News and I published an investigation of our findings, showing that this is part of a larger pattern of Gov. DeSantis's administration going to extreme ends - including lying to health care providers - to block transgender kids from getting the health care they need and deserve.

I'll be on at 2pm ET (14 UT), AMA!

Text: Wildfires in many regions are becoming more frequent and more severe. Most of the headlines focus on the short and long-term impacts these disasters have on plants, animals and the economy. But what's going on underground? Research is just beginning to demonstrate the impacts disturbances to microbial communities can have on soil composition, plant behavior and human health.

Join us today at 2 PM ET (19UT) for an AMA, organized by the American Society for Microbiology, focused on the impact wildfires are having on microbial communities. We will take questions about experimental approaches being taken to study this issue, share insight into how the increased frequency and severity of fires is affecting ecosystems at the micro and macro levels, and discuss strategies for managing fire-affected ecosystems under changing fire regimes.
Ask us anything!

Text:  Hello altogether,

unfortunately I have many different questions about all things fat and protein digestion, specifically regarding animal products with different fat content.

I want to understand the science and the chemistry behind the whole topic and also educate myself even further because it seems like I know nothing.

I tried to do some „research“ and found several different claims, opinions and explanations.

Before I get into the questions, I want to present the claims from the two different „camps“ because obviously there are more schools of thought?!

**Team fatty meat/protein:**

*The more fat that is in the protein the more delayed is digestion and therefore it sits in the small intestine longer and the required enzymes have more time to do their work and help digest the protein and the fat more efficiently, fully and easier! If the protein is leaner it goes to the digestive tract much faster, probably undigested and not fully absorbed by the small intestine.*

*Muscle meats like chicken breast or lean steak can aggravate constipation and therefore its beneficial to replace them with gelatinous meats instead and cuts with more soft tissue like chicken thighs, fatty meats etc. Humans can only use meat fibers properly when they come with fat, collagen and other substances.*

*Dark meat like chicken thighs or fatty cuts of meat contain more nutrients like zinc, iron and more vitamins like b12 additional folate, pantothenic acid, selenium, phosphorous, and vitamins K and A which aids in digestion.*

**Team lean meat/protein:**

*Meats with higher fat content take longer to digest. Also, foods with the least amount of fat, least amount connective tissues, and shorter muscle fibers are easier to digest. It means that fish is the easiest meat to digest, then poultry, pork and lastly beef*

*it also means that if the piece of chicken or turkey you are eating has more fat or long muscle fibers (thighs or drumsticks) than a LEAN piece of steak or a LEAN cut of pork, then that piece of chicken will be harder to digest!*

*A piece of boneless skinless chicken breast is easier to digest than a chicken thigh. Lean ground beef (93/7) is easier to digest than fattier ground beef (80/20) and a lean filet is easier to digest than a ribeye or beef brisket, chick etc.*

Ok, so far so good and I’m confused.

What I found is a study about myoglobin and it seems like that dark meat or cuts of poultry and beef with more myoglobin and more connective tissue are „harder“ to digest than white meat or poultry/beef with less myoglobin!?

**My questions are:**

What sits longer in the stomach, how long and why?

What sits longer in the small intestine, how long and why?

What kind of poultry/meat moves faster through the digestive tract, especially through the small intestine?

Which cuts require more effort, more enzymes, more stomach acid?

Which cuts are more taxing on the liver?

Is it easier and quicker for the small intestine to absorb nutrients from lean or fatty protein and why?

which factor determines whether a piece of animal protein/fat is light or heavy, fast or slow digesting when looking at the fat/food in isolation. Is it the fat content, connective tissue, a combination?

Is a fatty ribeye or hamburger patty (70/30 or 80/20) easier to digest than a lean filet steak? Or a fatty chicken thigh easier than a chicken breast? Pretend that all meats/beef/poultry are cooked to a moist internal temperature, not overcooked, tough or dry

Are low fat dairy products easier and quicker to digest than full fat dairy products?

At the end of the day I want to know which cuts of poultry/meat/beef/fish are easier to digest for the stomach and small intestine and which cuts are moving faster through the digestive tract. Also from which cuts the small intestine can easier absorb nutrients?

Im looking for a evidence based scientific answers in plain English that I can understand what’s going on and why. I don’t need study’s, although it would be nice, but everything backed up with science based explanations and evidence not opinions or preferences like almost everything on YouTube, food blogs etc. I’m looking for people who study this stuff or work in this field and know what they talking about.

Im very thankful for every explanation, help and for everyone who reads this.

I appreciate every Tipp where and how I can educate myself because I don’t want to be lazy.

Thank you very much and have a great day

Text: In the way I understand the engram model of memory, sensory information passing through the brain is broken apart, interpreted and stored as neural connections. So for example, the memory of an elephant would be broken into its parts, its context, the feeling associated with it at the time, etc. So, while it might be different for different types of data, has it yet been discovered what the minimum structure is for a memory, or even the smallest portion of a memory? If that unit is a single new neural connection, what does that correspond to mentally?

Text: Let say at some point somebody is born with a beneficial mutation (e.g. darker skin in region with a lot of sunlight). If they mate with someone from the original population, this mutation is only partially noticeable in the children (e.g.children of mixed race parents are not as dark/light as their parents). And when these children have children of their own with partners of the population-without-mutation the trait is even less present 
You can see where this is going... the mutation gets   'dilluted' over the different generations. 

Obviously,  mutations do spread over a population. But how?

Conversely, not setting an alarm allows us to wake up in the most natural and gradual way, but is perhaps not very practical and results in an unstable rhythm.

Text: Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Biology, Chemistry, Neuroscience, Medicine, Psychology**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for 'X' were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;.

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

Text: My kids were asking me why high altitude is colder than lower. The answer, I understand, is that the air is thinner. The thinner the air, the fewer air molecules colliding with your body and therefore less energy transferred to your body, and therefore colder. (correct?)

But that got me thinking. Air is a good insulator, compared to, say, the ground, because it is a gas and therefore less dense, and therefore provides less capacity for heat transfer, right? So as you get higher and the air gets thinner and thinner, wouldn't this insulating property INCREASE? If so, wouldn't your body would retain more of its heat as you went higher and therefore feel warmer, not colder? 

But experience shows this isn't true. The top of Mount Everest is definitely colder than the base. Why? What am I missing about this relationship between gas / density / heat / warmth?

Why do the rocks across from them on the road seem to be a totally different type of rock, and why do they seem to manifest an entirely different type of erosion?

Things like that. I've always wished there was a sort of Google maps type thing made specifically for unique geologic features.. Is there at least a database that has these things listed where I could get these kinds of questions answered?

Text: I've been quite fascinated all my life about the original Severn Bridge, which is around 40 miles from where I live. Last week I was able to get the opportunity to walk across it and found it surprisingly stable. Something that seems fairly unique about the Severn Bridge compared to most suspension bridges around the world would be that its cables are in a diagonal, almost triangular pattern, rather than being vertical like on most other suspension bridges. The Humber Bridge in the UK also uses the same unusual diagonal cable design that the Severn Bridge uses, yet for some reason the vast majority of large suspension bridges built outside the UK in the past 50 years still use the traditional vertical cable design, despite it seeming less stable. The timelapses I've seen of most suspension bridges that use vertical wires seem to have noticeably more deck movement than the few with diagonal/triangular cables.

I've done some experiments with different bridge designs in the free piece of software Bridge Designer 2016, and found that giving a bridge the diagonal/triangular cable layout found on the Severn and Humber Bridges in the UK made it much more stable than the same design with traditional vertical cables. Since this seems to be the case, is there a reason why the majority of suspension bridges outside of the UK have continued to be built with the more traditional layout? I know that the Severn Bridge was a world first in its use of diagonal/triangular cables, but any patents that may have been registered during its design and construction would have almost certainly expired by the mid-late 1980s (it was opened in 1966).

Can each hydrogen atom take an election and therefore be bonded?
Assuming it can exist, I presume the likelihood is that it would degrade into water and hydrogen gas. Is that right? Why?

Text: We are taught in 7th grade that mass is conserved. We are later taught that momentum and energy are conserved.

Up to a constant, these are roughly given by m\*v^(0), m\*v^(1), and m\*v^(2), respectively.

Of course, this is not exactly precise. Mass can become energy, kinetic energy can become potential, et cetera.

I know that the latter two of these come from Noether's theorem and symmetries of the universe (resp. spacial and time translation). But I've also heard about violations of various symmetry, though I'm not a physicists so I often don't really understand the details.

So, I have a few questions, hopefully all somewhat related to this introduction and the title question.

Is there a symmetry/condition under which m\*v^(3) is conserved? Is there a (violated?) symmetry from which we could derive conservation of mass? What about m\*v^(n)? 

And I suppose this is maybe a bit more tangential, but when we say a symmetry is violated, what does that actually say about the universe? If time crystals show that time translational symmetry is &quot;violated&quot; does that mean we are wrong to assume time translational symmetry elsewhere? Or is it a matter of &quot;well, as far as we can tell, everything else is still time symmetric&quot;?

Text: Long short - few weeks ago for first time ever I saw slugs slexing it up on my front door. Despite this being the first time in my long life - I once again saw some slugs slexing on my front door again this week too!

Now the first time I saw them I learnt more about Jeremy - a sinister/left coiled snail due to a rare genetic issue(he's like a 1% chance mutation, probs less) - and learned ofc that Sinister snails can't usually mate with Dextral snails and so Sinisters need sinister mates.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_(snail)

NOW. Here comes my question. I see a few Redditors posting in various subs also witnessing Slex(slug-sex) for the first time but HERE is my issue;

Every time I see the slugs coiled up in their coitus - they seem to be chirally inclined to coitus that up the same way.

Now, if snails are Herms but can be sinister on occasion and only mate with Sinisters - is there any chirality of existence in slugs too? Just like you can be a sinister snail instead of a standard and usual Dextral - are there sinister slugs out there who can't find a mate befause they keep just finding dextrals who like it left to right rather than the kinky right to left and they are doomed, like Jeremy(without the intervention of science and human matchmaking) to never ever get their rocks off and have kids, unless their 1% existence chances on another slug of 1% existence as two equally sinister beings???

I have done some research into tectonic plates in an attempt to create a realistic fantasy world, but I seem to be confusing myself.

People talk about oceanic plates and continental plates, but looking at tectonic plates maps show that most tectonic plates have both conitental and oceanic crust.

Is the idea of them being separate plates a lie? Are they just kind of random and could have been anywhere? Also, do tectonic plates changed direction over time? Are there any good sources of information for this?

I will also have to teach this to 10 year olds at some point, so anything geared towards that age that answers my questions would be great, but not necessary.

Text: I read this article and I'm confused: https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/world/thwaites-doomsday-glacier-sea-level-climate/index.html

From my understanding, the risk of glaciers melting causing sea level rise is specifically with regard to glaciers on land, who would either fall off completely, thus displacing large amounts of water, or slowly melt into the ocean, which adds water to the ocean level.

However, I'm struggling to understand the physics of this specific case - it mentions the glacier is anchored to the sea bed. Thus, is it essentially acting as if it is NOT displacing any water? And if it entirely eroded from beneath, the sea level would thus have to rise to accommodate the displacement of the now floating glacier?

If so, why is it different if a glacier is anchored (I.e connected to the sea bed with presumably no water in between the sea bed and bottom of glacier, as opposed to that very same glacier without being anchored? What about if we assume 99.99% of the glacier bottom was eroded and theoretically that 0.01% of glacier could hold it attached to the sea floor, would it still act the same as if it was 100% anchored and not floating?) 

Thanks for helping my understanding.

I have seen tons of scanning electron images of atoms, and since DNA is obviously made of atoms, why are there no atomic scale images of DNA where we can see the double helix close up?

What about this process takes so long? In my ignorance, mRNA vaccines would seem more complex and difficult to develop.

Text: We’re taught that T cells require 2 signals for activation (engagement with an antigen-MHC complex and engagement of co-stimulatory molecules that are only expressed in the presence of inflammatory cytokines). When you have signal 1 without signal 2, these peripheral T cells supposedly undergo peripheral deletion or anergy. 

However, during an infection, you do have inflammatory cytokines present, so theoretically self-reactive T cells would receive both signal 1 and 2 and therefore activate. Do anergy and deletion just not occur during an infection? I am assuming there some another mechanism that addresses this but I haven’t been able to find an answer.

Sure I will be a lot slimmer visually but if a cell has the same number of dna/data regardless of size, then would losing fat purely from a Data minimization perspective, not make sense?

Text: I was taught that mountain ranges create dryer environments on the side facing away from the prevailing winds and wetter environments on the side facing towards it. In most cases, this holds true. Cascades, Sierra Nevada, Madagascar, NZ South Island, etc. The Andes is an almost perfect example of this because the locations of the dryer and wetter environments switch as the prevailing winds change wrt latitude.

However, there seems to be some cases in which the rain shadow seems to be inverted. For example, in southern India, there is the Western Ghats mountain range. The prevailing winds at this latitude blow from northeast to southwest, which would should mean that the eastern side is wetter than the western side of the range. However, it's the opposite that's true. The western side of this mountain range is wetter than the eastern side. This is hardly the only example of this, you see this same sort of thing if you look at western Mexico or Turkey's Black Sea coast. 

Why does the rain shadow seem to be on the wrong side in some situations?

I mean, we are definitely going to seriously screw up our planet and possibly wipe ourselves out, but do we have any reasonable idea /how/?

Text: I don't know too much about shit like this, so maybe I am misunderstanding something, but I don't understand how we can refer to events that happened in the universe with precise timestamps. From my understanding (very limited), time passes different in different places due to gravitational time dilation. As an example, in Interstellar, the water planet's time passed significantly slower.

Essentially, the core of my question is: wouldn't the time since the creation of the universe be different depending on how time passes in the area of the universe you are? Like if a planet experienced similar time dilation to the one in Interstellar, wouldn't the age of the universe be lower? Is the age of the universe (13.7b years), just the age of someone experiencing the level of time dilation we do? I understand that time is a human concept used to explain how things progress, so I might be just confused.

Anyways, can anyone help me out? I have not read very much into this so the answer is prolly easy but idk. Thanks

What would happen to the brain as a whole and the individual parts of it? What would happen to the person whose consciousness has been removed? Would the person still be able to function, either somewhat normally or almost like a robot? If you removed two people's consciousnesses and swapped them in each other's places, would they then be conscious of each other bodies or still their own? What would happen if you swapped consciousnesses with a human and an animal, like a chimpanzee? What would happen if you swapped consciousnesses between someone whose alive and someone whose not?

Text: I've heard with the Omicron variant, people were mentioning that it has become less deadly, which evolutionary speaking, helps it spread more.  I've also heard a similar account for Influenza - that the Spanish Flu became much more 'mild' (relatively speaking) simply because it was more 'fit' if it had a lower mortality rate.

I'm wondering how this relates with regards to other diseases.  For example, is this a factor in what made the successive black plague outbreaks less deadly (with the first one in the mid-14th century being infamously horrible)?  And not to downplay how bad smallpox or measles is today, but was there a time when it was even deadlier, and has since become less deadly?  Or do some diseases always stay at some mortality rate?

Edit: I should add I'm interested because my &quot;common understanding&quot; of why the black plague became less bad is acquired immunity.  But given this recent insight from COVID-19, I'm wondering if this &quot;evolving to less deadly&quot; was relevant for the black plague as well.  And as well for other diseases...

So for example in violinists the part of the brain associated with fine motor control is larger, or in taxi drivers that for spacial memory. (Or so I heard)

Given that there is finite space in the brain, do other now less used areas grow smaller?

And what does this mean in practical terms for the acquisition of skills? Is there a practical limit to how much a brain can &quot;learn&quot; without unlearning things, or is how much time one can invest into developing and maintaining skills the only limiting factor?

And regarding the breeding process - is there some kind of rolling tradeoff where genetic changes accumulate?  By that I mean if you arbitrarily quantified divergence, say 10 units / generation.   Maybe at after 40 units divergence it's 20/20 epigenetic/genetic, but then at 100 units it's 30/70 epigenetic/genetic.

My interest in this stems from fish that live in high-sulfur streams.  There are very few examples but cutting edge work found that many of the adaptions were epigenetic.

Text: I've recently gotten myself very confused about certain ways that circuits work at a massive scale, partially due to [Veritasium](https://youtu.be/bHIhgxav9LY)/AlphaPhoneix's recent videos on the subject. Basically, isn't it true that electrons move through the ground/earth/crust over very long time spans? And is that movement necessary to make our power grid function? I think I understand that in AC power lines, electrons are just moving back and forth a tiny distance. But that's not the case for DC, right?

Suppose a giant solar farm in North Africa, with massive high voltage DC undersea cables sending the power into Europe. This is already a reality, but for sake of argument suppose the power is arbitrarily large, runs 24/7, is always flowing one way, and the experiment continues for an arbitrary length of time. Isn't it the case that an electron that began in the wires in north Africa could, and in fact certainly would, move all the way through the wire to Europe, end up in the ground/earth in Europe, and by the massive &quot;pressure&quot; differential, eventually drift all the way through the ground and end up back in the wire in north Africa?

I think the answer here is that this is correct in its most basic inception, but that there are way too many electrons to talk about it this way. But what if the earth was arbitrarily small, or the cable running from one side of the earth to the other? Suppose a tidally locked planet, with the sun side completely covered in solar panels, sending the power to the dark side. The planet would become a capacitor, with the dark side negatively charged. Surely there is some situation where this would cause actual engineering issues, and need return wires or something.

I hope this made sense and you can help clear up my understanding, this question has been bothering me for years!

Text: So I just saw a picture of the hands of a person with vitiligo, and they had the same pattern on both hands of remaining vs lost pigment - a very similarly shaped pattern on the front of each hand, including an almost (but not quite) identical patch of missing pigment within the pigmented area, and each ring finger had a similar loop of remaining pigment near the knuckle joint, swooping upwards on the inner side, towards the next joint. 


It made me wonder, what determines where pigment is lost? It often seems to be not exactly symmetrical, but similar enough on either side of the body that I have to assume  that it’s not random. 


Like, thinking of Winnie Harlow, her pigment loss around her mouth is roughly the same on the right and the left, such that it almost looks like a consistent shape around her mouth. 


Can anyone please explain? I tried Googling it, but no luck. 


Thanks!

These problems got me wondering whether our or a mammal’s brain decomposes various sounds that heard everyday. For instance, if we’re talking with a friend in a public space, how does our brain know which sounds to filter out (other people talking in the vicinity) and which sounds not to filter out (sound of a friend’s voice). Is this mechanism simply the brain performing Fourier Transforms instantaneously or is it simply a biological mechanism?

Text: Edit: please read what I say about Japan and Korea as well. Everyone refuting Chinese statistics needs to explain those countries. Both have higher female smoking rates and similar pollution per capita. 


So I was reading this article https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/sep/10/cancer-breakthrough-is-a-wake-up-call-on-danger-of-air-pollution and they said that there were 300k cases of lung cancer globally per year and 6000 were in the UK. And I thought to myself well damn, the UK is less than 1% of world population how do they account for 2% of lung cancer patients? 

Then the article goes on to say that this is in part due to air pollution.  But I have lived in both China and the UK and well the UK has clean air. Also about 40% of people smoke in China vs less than 15% in the UK. So shouldn't China have more than 300k cases of lung cancer a year just given it's smoking statistics vs UK? 

So I looked everything up and, from the answers google gave, I seemed to be getting my statistics pretty close. As I can tell, we aren't talking about death due to lung cancer,  we are talking diagnosis per 100k. So why are so many fewer people diagnosed with lung cancer in China vs the UK? And does this throw doubts on this research?

Also, just to follow up I looked up lung cancer rates in South Korea and Japan, other countries I have lived in which both suffer chronic high pollution rates (mostly due to Chinese drift pollution) as well as very high levels of smokers. To my surprise both countries had statistics in line with China's. This makes me inclined to not believe that these are just China hiding its numbers.

Text: We are researchers from the Allen Institute, UW Medicine, and Kaiser Permanente, and have genetically profiled and mapped key regions of the brains of individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease to uncover cell types, genetic patterns, and other biomarkers affected by this debilitating neurological disorder affecting millions across the world.

Early findings have revealed cell populations that are preferentially affected by Alzheimer's - both increasing and decreasing in number - and other physiological changes that could point to new targets for treatments in the future.

This massive, collaborative undertaking, the [Seattle Alzheimer's Disease Brain Cell Atlas](http://portal.brain-map.org/explore/seattle-alzheimers-disease) (SEA-AD), has resulted in a high-resolution, high-quality, publicly accessible atlas of aging and Alzheimer's disease. The massive data set represents detailed analysis of over 1.2 million brain cells from 84 patients. The data is openly available to other researchers in the hopes of catalyzing further research and improving our understanding of the complex and likely heterogenous nature of Alzheimer's.

We are:

+ **Jeremy Miller (Ph.D.) - Senior Scientist, Allen Institute**: Dr. Miller joined the Allen Institute in 2011 to help with computational data analysis of the Allen Human Brain Atlas project. He is first author on several major manuscripts describing the Allen Institute's large-scale transcriptomic resources on the adult and developing human and non-human primate brain, including the Aging, Dementia, and Traumatic Brain Injury Study. Miller received his Ph.D. in neuroscience from UCLA, where he studied gene expression changes in the brain in Alzheimer's disease and normal aging in the lab of Dr. Daniel Geschwind.
+ **Kyle Travaglini (Ph.D.) - Scientist I, Allen Institute**: Kyle Travaglini is a Scientist at the Allen Institute for Brain Science. As a member of the Human Cell Types program, Kyle is focused on characterizing the molecular and cellular changes that underpin Alzheimer's disease. Previously, he completed a Ph.D. in Biochemistry at Stanford University, where he constructed a single cell transcriptomic atlas of the human lung under the mentorship of Dr. Mark Krasnow. Prior to that, he conducted research with Dr. Steven Clark at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he received a B.S. in Biochemistry and identified a mechanism in yeast that helps ensure their proteins are built correctly.
+ **Shubhabrata &quot;Joey&quot; Mukherjee (Ph.D., MS) - Assistant Professor, UW Department of Medicine**: Dr. Shubhabrata is trained in statistics, psychometrics, and genetics related to Alzheimer's disease research. He is an active member of the AD Genetics Consortium (ADGC) and the International Genomics of Alzheimer's project (IGAP).

She is the leader for the neuropathology quantification efforts using the whole slide image analysis in FFPE analysis and Luminex from human brain tissue extractions.
+ **Eitan S. Kaplan - Ph.D. Scientific Project and Alliance Manager**:
Eitan S. Kaplan joined the Allen Institute in 2020 and serves as the Scientific Project and Alliance Manager for the multi-site Human Alzheimer’s Disease Collaborative Research Center. The Human AD Center aims to build high-resolution maps of Alzheimer’s patients’ brains and thereby generate a detailed understanding of the core molecular and cellular phenotype of Alzheimer’s disease at the level of cell types and molecular pathways. The center seeks to pinpoint how and where the progressive disorder starts, and ultimately, to find new targets for therapy. Eitan previously worked at Seattle Children's Research Institute as a Scientific Project Manager in Business Operations, and as a neuroscience researcher in the Center for Integrative Brain Research studying gene-environment interaction in neuro-developmental disorders. Eitan earned his doctorate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology investigating the mechanisms underlying experience-dependent synaptic plasticity in the cerebral cortex.

In positron emission tomography, is timing resolution the ability of the scanner to accurately estimate the time between photon detection and proton annihilation? Or is it dependent on the number and length of time frames that can be imaged within a certain period, as is the case in a dynamic PET setting?

Is there a difference between the definitions of &quot;timing&quot; and &quot;temporal&quot; resolution? And is there a difference between static PET vs. dynamic PET in terms of timing resolution?

Text: I've heard that telomeres shorten with each cell division, and that this is one of the processes involved in ageing. But for example in humans, a child's cells all are the result of cell division starting from a single cell, which in turn comes from the two gametes of its parents. These gametes are themselves the result of a chain of cell divisions in the parents. So the further you advance in the &quot;generations&quot; axis, the longer these &quot;chains of cell division&quot;. So, how come it's not the case that each generation has shorter telomeres than the one before it?

More generally: a child's cells ultimately come from its parents' cells, and ageing roughly consists of cell damage accumulated over time; so how come the state of ageing isn't transmitted from parent to child, but is instead &quot;reset&quot; every time reproduction happens?

I'm having a hard time writing my thoughts in words, but I hope you understand what I mean.

However, with modern global warming, while some areas of the world are getting wetter and seeing more rainfall, these areas (and other arid and semi-arid ones) are seeing reductions in rainfall levels. Why is this? Shouldn't these areas be seeing increases in precipitation as the temperature rises?

It's states that MHC receptor  genes are among the most diverse in the human gene pool, so  consequently, there exist many MHC receptors: two people can have two  different types of receptors. Some receptors are better/worse than  others at presenting antigens.

So...is  it safe to say that one reason some people don't get COVID/ have mild  symptoms is because they have MHC receptors that are better at  presenting the antigen? And that those with severe symptoms have  receptors that don't present as well?

However, Cu has the configuration [Ar] 4s1 3d10 instead of [Ar] 4s2 3d9. I can somewhat understand that a full d-orbital can somehow be preferred, since the total spin stays the same (first rule of Hund), even though the second rule of Hund is not followed. But where I am completely lost is with elements like ruthenium ([Kr] 5s1 4d7), where Hunds rules are completely ignored and the removed second 5s electron doesn’t contribute to a fully filled d-orbital. 

I want to understand why this is the case. I get that they’re somehow lower in energy, but I want to understand why. My search in old studybooks and internet did not help, even my old university prof doesn’t know.

So my question is: how is it that some elements have unexpected electron configurations, and why?

Meanwhile lots of people are getting sick and if it progresses to something worse it is defined by what it caused, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. 

I find it odd at any university in the US a dozen students in each class are out sick then the next week or two another dozen. Each absence is costly, yet even at Universities when the students go to the doctors on campus they make no attempt to study “what is this illness” and whether warning classes about what is spreading or attempt to isolate it or stop it. When it knocks these young adults out for a week it could be a terrible “bug” yet the doctor’s reaction is “it is just some sort of bug.”

IIRC, one of the possible ways this may have happened was through excessive volcanic eruptions, with the after-effect being said drastic greenhouse effect. Is this a legitimate hypothesis for Venus' current conditions ?

Text: I saw an article by researchers from the Max-Planck-Institute about brain structure and connectivity changes associated with pornography consumption recently and found it had rather drastic seeming implications for the caudate in that consuming porn could be responsible for just shrinking its gray matter ([https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1874574](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1874574)). 

Now, having been in that age, and made use of the stimulation from that type of media rather often (in the past, of course), this seems kind of relevant and concerning for me. So I've come here to ask: 

Does gray matter in general or at least in specific regions of the brain including the caudate regenerate after it's shrunk through the kind of effects porn consumption appears to have on it or is it most likely just going to be lost for good because of it?

But what are the chances of bigger life forms being sedimented alongside the plankton? Would fish/aquatic dinosaurs even turn into oil if the conditions were right? I assume the latter are made up of more protein and less carbohydrate compared to plankton.

Are there any reasonable estimates how much oil is not from plankton? I would expect values well below 1 %, but feels like at least *some* of fossil fuel molecules could be from dinosaurs.

Text:  

Greetings! I am relatively new to Chemistry and the natural sciences overall, and have a question regarding molecules vs ions.

To   my understanding, molecules are always neutral as they are not the   compound of two charged atoms (+ or -), but rather the fusion of two   neutral atoms. Ions, however, are the other way around, and the more   ions you add (polyatomic ions), it will flip between being neutral or   charged. But, how then, can water (H2O) be dipolar? Perhaps I have   understood the concept of polarity wrong. If the molecules are neutral   as neither the Hydrogen or Oxygen atoms are charged, how can the   water-molecule have two sides? Or is it for this very reason that it has   two sides, simply because it is the fusion of two neutral atoms?

On  a  similar topic, I must also ask the difference between ionic bonding  and  molecular formation ... The ions, of course, attract other charged   atoms (other ions), because the valence-electrons wish to jump over to   differently charged ions since atoms strive to have a full outer shell.   But, molecules do not do this, do they? How are they different? Are  they  simply the combination of two atoms, in which the electrons do not   leave their respective atoms, but rather join together in an &quot;orbital   fusion&quot; in which they can travel freely (until broken up)? This would   make sense since they are not charged, and therefore have no attraction   to leave their own atoms for opposing ones.

I am very thankful for answers! Good day :)

Text: I've been watching a lot of YouTube videos and reading a lot about criticality (and the various incidents and accidents around the world) and mostly thanks to the Managing The Atom YouTube channel I am getting closer to understanding, But there is still one thing just can't quite understand.

I understand that certain things are &quot;radioactive&quot; to a lesser or greater degree. What I don't understand yet is that if a material is subcritical, is it possible to be in a room with that material without being adversely affected due to the low amount of radiation? If more and more material is added bringing a closer to criticality does the amount of radiation increase slowly making my proximity to the material more dangerous, or does the material remain at the same level of radioactivity until criticality where it will suddenly emit large amounts of radiation making my proximity unsafe.

I hope my amateur explanation is clear.

Thank you.

Of course the numbers scientists got are still an estimate, but why is it (in the science world) widely accepted.

Even by the most conservative &quot;dog age to human age&quot; calculations, this seems to be around 140 years in human age. This is significantly higher than the oldest human lifespan ever recorded, which led me to wonder if the translation breaks down as dogs get older. 

It's already known to be non-linear because temporal age and developmental age aren't linearly transferable across species, but it makes me wonder if dogs actually have higher lifespan variance than humans or if it's just an incomplete model.

Text: If you've ever watched the shoreline on a big body of water, especially where people are surfing for example, you've seen what I'm talking about. The ocean surface will be relatively calm with smaller waves coming in, and then all of a sudden, a handful of larger waves come, then the ocean calms down again for a period of time. These groups of waves are often called &quot;sets&quot; or I've also read &quot;wave trains&quot;.

I understand how and why ocean waves form, how different frequencies emerge from storms and how the shorter period ones die out as the larger/longer ones eventually can move across entire oceans with relatively little loss in energy. I have a decent understanding of certain types of waves and their dynamics as I studied engineering in school, and have also been an avid surfer for twenty years.

However, I've searched online numerous times for an explanation as to **WHY** or **HOW** ocean waves group into sets, rather than simply remaining as a uniform train of similar waves, and nobody seems to ever explain the mechanisms behind it. They simply mention that it happens, and move on.

An astrophysicist friend once explained acoustic resonance to me as his guess to a possible reason, which seemed to have something to it, but I truly have no idea. My latest search's top result yielded &quot;large period waves combine with local short period waves to form these groups&quot; which is complete BS.

Text: All other things being equal, adding weight/moving weight lower on the club head is said to increase the launch angle of the ball. But why? Shouldn't it just be the face angle? I read an article that said that the head would pivot during the impact, with the lower center of gravity moving beneath the center of gravity of the ball, thus resulting in a higher launch angle because the face angle changed?

I'm not sure I understand correctly. I watched a slo mo videos of several shots and I couldn't see what they were saying, though it was clear in nearly every case that the ball always left the face on a greater angle than the face itself was pointing.

Is it something to do with spin/roll during the collision? Or something about the offset center of gravities and equal and opposite reactions?

Text: I understand how and why ocean waves form, how different frequencies emerge from storms and how the shorter period ones die out as the larger/longer ones eventually can move across entire oceans with relatively little loss in energy. I have a decent understanding of certain types of waves and their dynamics as I studied engineering in school, and have also been an avid surfer for twenty years.

However, I've searched online numerous times for an explanation as to **WHY** or **HOW** ocean waves group into sets, rather than simply remaining as a uniform train of similar waves, and nobody seems to ever explain the mechanisms behind it. They simply mention that it happens, and move on.

An astrophysicist friend once explained acoustic resonance to me as his guess to a possible reason, which seemed to have something to it, but I truly have no idea. My latest search's top result yielded &quot;large period waves combine with local short period waves to form these groups&quot; which is complete BS. I've also seen someone write that wind gusts are responsible, which doesn't seem accurate either.

Does anybody have a way of explaining this phenomenon?

Thank you very much!

Or would there have been an isolated group that had to inbreed initially to grow the species?

Text: The unit Sievert has, in contrast to the unit Gray, a weighting factor to account for the &quot;destructive&quot; effects of different radiation types, i.e. gamma and x rays are weighted with the factor 1 (you can find a table [here](https://nuclear-power.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Radiation-weighting-factors-ICRP.png)). 

Neutrons however are scaled by their energy, for 10 - 100keV it would be 10, for 100keV - 2MeV it is 20. But for neutrons with an energy of 2 - 20MeV the factor goes back down to 10.

My question is, why's that? Shouldn't the &quot;destructive&quot; effects increase with energy?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering if epigenetic changes show up and make a difference in DNA. I'm not very good at science, but I know personal gene expressions can change over the years and I was curious if that would be representative in raw DNA sample files. Should people re-submit a DNA sample if they good through significant changes over the years, or would the raw data remain the same? 

&amp;#x200B;

Say, for example, someone submits a DNA sample to 23andme or a similar website, and at the time they are very active and muscular, and at an average weight. If that same person were to submit a new DNA sample a decade later and were overweight and sedentary at the time of the new test, would the raw DNA change?

They both carry infectious disease, they both feed in the same territory, and they are both bloodmeal parasites. The same goes with the famous red meat allergy you can contract with a lone star tick.

How does the type of tick vary which also varies your risk to tick borne illnesses?

Text: I know why the weather forecast for 2 weeks away is usually worthless, and ~3 days is the max at which we can get a pretty good to get an estimate of the weather. But what about going in the opposite direction? Short period, precise location, precise weather?

I know the weather for my city for today is intermittent rains, about 50% cloud coverage. But why can't I find out if my street address will have sun or rain in half an hour? It's currently raining. Does it make sense to wait for it to stop within next hour or so, or should I call a taxi home?

I can find &quot;possible thunderstorms in the evening&quot; a day ahead, but I can't tell if I have 15 minutes to roll my BBQ and hide before everything's drenched, or the heavy dark clouds I see rolling over the city will pass me to the side and leave my area dry. 

With current technology it feels like it *should* be easy enough to predict weather for a specific spot. Sure there will still be situation when the prediction is uncertain; the cloud passes just by, it may go 200m west or 200m east from me and I'll get rain or not. But in most cases it should be perfectly predictable that a cloud raining here, moving in this direction, at this speed, will rain there, in x minutes, and with this size it will take that many minutes to pass.

Text:  A large portion of our already oversized brains is used for coordinating our limbs. This makes some sense since there is a lot of &quot;math&quot; that needs to be worked out for the inverse kinematics of something as simple as buttoning a button. But how do small animals, like spiders, manage complex tasks with comparatively few brain cells. Brains are costly in terms of metabolism and evolution is not wasteful. So I am assuming there is a reason why we require literally billions of CNS neurons to coordinate our limbs while spiders get by on just tens of thousands.

Text: I think my question stems from a misunderstanding of the balancing act nuclear reactors play. My understanding is that prompt neutrons comprise of almost all neutrons produced in a reactor (&gt;99%), while delayed neutrons provide the rest (&lt;1%). Due to how quickly prompt neutrons are created (on the order of a few nano seconds), reaching prompt criticality results in a dangerous power excursion too fast to control for. Therefore, we keep the reactor just under prompt criticality and have the delayed neutrons provide the rest to reach criticality and therefore a sustained chain reaction (prompt sub-critical and delayed critical).

So, let's say a reactor is currently in this balancing act and has reached a sustained/controlled reaction and is producing 1000MW. The electricity demand has gone up and now the power plant wants to increase power to 1500MW. How is this possible without tipping over the already very fine balancing act into prompt criticality? Put another way, how can a reactor have a dynamic power output when increasing or decreasing power by a significant amount means either a power excursion or fizzling out?

Would that experience be the same on the surface of the moon?  Forgive my ignorance.  My one regret about my education (I'm 48) is that I never took physics or astronomy.  Thank you in advance.

Text: The angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence when light is reflected from a smooth surface. 

What is the mechanism of this function? When light hits the surface, the energy of the photons are absorbed by the atoms that comprise the surface material. Then the atoms emit that energy as 'reflected' photons. Why do the atoms emit that energy in a particular direction, along a path defined by the angle of incidence? 

To my understanding, photonic energy has been absorbed in the form of electrons being excited to a higher energy level; then, the electrons return to their original energy level by emitting an equivalently energetic photon. At the atomic level, how does the direction of the incoming energy have an impact on direction in which the subsequent emission occurs?

Text: I was thinking about this and I am quite curious if something like Olympus Mons could form here. (Not really an exact replica, but somewhat similar with some changes.)

The characteristics I am thinking about is pretty much a stationary plate, a powerful hotspot (similar to the Hawaiian hotspot) and a stable crust (a thick craton) for such a volcano (more like a really high plateau) to stand on with minimal sinkage.

The conditions met would not really exist on Earth at some time or another, but the closest thing to that, in my opinion, is the Tibesti mountains in Africa, where a hotspot underneath the Saharan Meta-craton produced a few volcanoes.

Could it exist in some form and, if so, what process would lead to that and how would it form?

Text: **What are you doing to get clean air?**

As the fear of airborne illnesses has heightened, people have understandably become much more concerned about potentially contagious strangers and are choosing to go where high air quality standards are maintained. Conventional approaches have been focused on making filters tighter, but filter media can only be made so small before becoming difficult to move air effectively or efficiently. Reducing nanoparticles by agglomerating them into larger, aggregated clusters is the key. Larger particles are more easily mitigated and fall to the ground more quickly. [Atmofizer](https://atmofizer.com/) is leading 4th generation in air technology, with patented agglomeration tech using acoustic pressure waves to reduce airborne nanoscopic particles-without using filters and saving our landfills! Another benefit we hear is the reduction of odors, including strong smoke odors like cannabis. Cleaner air apparently smells a lot better too!

But from what I've learned in school, and also the result I get when I try googling this problem, is that the mass *does not* change at all, and it makes sense, if you put 4 mol of hydrogen and 2 mol of oxygen in, you'd expect the same amount out with their respective masses.

But if that's the case, where does the energy released come from? Is that some sort of potential energy I'm not aware about?

Text: I am reading about space weather and I'm curious about how it's forecasted. 

For example, I have found out that DSCOVR measures magnetic field readings as well as solar wind density and speed, but what does this data tell us about severity and impacts on Earth? 

Are high solar wind speeds more disruptive than low ones? Or does it have to do with more density? What fluctuations in magnetic field readings indicate unusual sun activity?

How do these things come together in a forecast? Is it easy to use that data to understand space weather, or do you need to process it heavily to forecast?

Thank you for indulging an interest!

Text: I live near the Mediterranean, in a region where it doesn't rain 4 months a year, and we still get plenty of mosquitoes every summer. There is practically zero fresh water in the area, still or running. This leads me to think that mosquitoes aren't just flying around looking for water to lay their eggs through sheer luck. They must have a way of detecting those places where water is present.

Similarly, if you leave rusted metal in water that is NOT in contact with air (and thererfore can't become oxygenated), will the rust over time dissolve in the water and give

Furthermore, would increasing the temperature of the water make the rust dissolve faster? (because then the concentration H3O+ in water with pH = 7 is increased).

Contrasting, if a group of participants have a history of being viewed as ugly by others, and I now say that they are beautiful, would they be exceptionally confident because they have never heard it before, or will they be more insecure because they could not believe that? I have had the help from the panelists to introduce the article The Praise Paradox by Eddie Brummelman, where it is said that keeping telling people they are intelligent or beautiful might put pressure on them to keep smart. But I would also like to know more about comparing the effect of drastic change of praises with continuing giving the same praise.

Text: I went on a visit to my local submarine museum this weekend, and had the opportunity to hear a talk by an ex submariner. One of the things he talked about was the red light in the control room. Part of the reason he gave for red lights was to do with night vision, which is well discussed elsewhere. 

But he gave a second reason, which was that when the periscope was up white light would travel up the periscope, alerting others to your presence.  Red light apparently &quot;lacks the power to travel up the periscope&quot;, and so you don't turn your submarine into a lighthouse. 

Is this true? And if so what's the physics behind it?

Eta: to be clear, I understand the night vision part. I only mention it to try and clarify that it wasn't the question, but apparently I failed. The question is specifically about the light travelling up the periscope, and given that red light travels better than other colours in air if this is true there's something more subtle than just an energy dependence going on.

Text: In the last 200 million years, we had only one mass extinction : K-Pg extinction and that too is largely attributed to the astroid impact (an outside factor). Whereas before that, there were series of mass extinctions and collapses at much regular interval like we had Triassic extinction around 201 MYA, Permian extinction around 251 MYA, Carboniferous rainforest collapse around 300 MYA and Devonian extinctions between 375 and 360 MYA. These are mainly attributed to earth systems.

Is it just a coincidence that the number of big extinctions have came down or has the earth became better for life? I’m aware that we did had extinctions like the one at end of Last Glacial Maximum but I don’t think any were that drastic compared to what Earth used to have earlier.

Edit : I see lot of comments that I ignored the ongoing 6th mass extinction. Well, yes because I’m more interested in understanding this from the perspective of (natural) factors which caused the other extinctions mentioned like plate tectonics, volcanic activity etc.  So, please ignore the human effect as it takes this question in an entirely different direction. Apologies for not clarifying this earlier.

Text: Ive been doing a lot of research in regards to this but can't seem to get or even understand the mechanism.

According to Davies et al.:&lt;&lt; *The npr-1 signaling pathway may act by presynaptic inhibition and could therefore alter transmitter release at the same sites as the SLO-1 channel. Mutations in the slo-1 gene, which confer considerably more (up to 2.5 times) ethanol resistance than null alleles of npr-1, have serious phenotypic consequences that would be likely to compromise fitness of animals carrying them. In contrast, allelic variation in genes like npr-1 may have more subtle alterations in transmitter release, and therefore may be more easily maintained in wild populations. Such allelic variation may have major phenotypic consequences when animals are exposed to ethanol*. &gt;&gt;

Text: Hello all, I've been studying the effect of stress and trauma on the brain for over a decade, and I have studied amygdala ablation for years. The amygdala is the emotion or fear center of the brain and hyperresponsive in PTSD. Because of that, I've been very interested in the region and its role in stress and trauma. In 2020, my team and I studied two patients with epilepsy who also had PTSD characterized by heightened fear responses to things that reminded them of their trauma. Post surgery that targeted the right amygdala, both the patients no longer suffered from PTSD.

In July 2022 my work was featured in [Interesting Engineering](https://interestingengineering.com/science/brain-surgery-treat-epilepsy-ptsd-fear), and the publication has helped organize this AMA session. I'll be available at 1pm ET (17 UT). Ask me anything about PTSD, the effects of stress and trauma on the brain, and amygdala removal in PTSD.

Text: This is a question that came out of a conversation about how transgender hormone replacement therapy for MtF people can decrease alcohol tolerance because you have less water in your body. This lead to the question of whether or not the amount of water in your system can effect how much caffeine you absorb from coffee. I looked it up and besides the mass of articles saying coffee dehydrated you, I only found one source that was kinda close which said that if you're more hydrated when you drink coffee you'll get better effects from the caffeine, and another article saying that drinking a lot of water will help flush your system of caffeine. The only remotely close article was written 6 years ago and lacks any medical sources.
I'm just a barista with a very basic understanding of how caffeine effects the body, mostly through my own experience. The somewhat contradictory information isn't very helpful and I was wondering if there was anyone who knows this stuff who could help me out.

* What would the wound look like before and after healing? 
* Would it ever heal to its former glory? 
* What equipment would the injured person need to use to make sure the leg heals (if there is no hospital available)? 
* Would there be scarring?

Text: To my understanding the energy that goes into an appliance plugged into your wall is lost in the form of heat and light (which eventually bounces around your room enough times to also become heat).

Does this mean that any appliance that produces heat as a byproduct is equally efficient as an electric space heater?

Does this mean running a PC in a thermostat heated room is essentially free, on account of the heat from the PC meaning the space heater has to run less?

If this isn't the case, then where does the excess energy from the appliance go, if not into the room the appliance is in?

This dumb question brought to you by, me fussing about energy bills this winter! Also a bit of natural curiosity since no answer feels obvious in an intuitive sense to me.

Text: There’s a research paper from 2008 that says anticholinergics can greatly weaken collagen *in pathogenic lung tissue* that's found in asthmatics. Specifically: “[In human lung fibroblasts, muscarinic receptors exert stimulatory  effects on collagen synthesis. Prolonged blockade of muscarinic-induced  collagen synthesis may contribute to reported beneficial long-term effects of anticholinergics in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease](https://href.li/?https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/32/3/555.long).” The muscarinic receptors they're talking about are acetycholine receptors. Anticholinergics block those. tldr, it’s *possible* that interference from anticholinergics can make already-existent collagen weaker. 

In 2013 there’s another citing the previous paper, finding that “[human tenocytes are stimulated to proliferate by acetylcholine through an EGFR signalling pathway](https://href.li/?https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3582816/)”, which seems to mean that &quot;progenitor&quot; tendon tissue responsible for making regular tendon tissue gets instructions to do that via acetylcholine. Anticholinergic drugs block acetylcholine, so the tenocytes would get less stimulation to produce new material, so old collagen doesn’t get replaced like it should. That would make it weak, but via a different method than the previous paper. Assuming this extends to all collagen  production and not just specifically tendon tissue, this adds on to the previous evidence that acetylcholine is needed for collagen synthesis, that anticholinergic drugs can interfere with the production of collagen and, if the previous paper is added in, possibly result in weaker collagen.

Citing *that* paper, in 2016 another paper looked at the effect of knocking out an acetylcholine receptor on arthritis, which is a collagen tissue: “[Taken together, the present study shows that while M3R−/−  mice \[the ones with the deleted receptor\] were not protected from CAIA \[induced arthritis\], they had a tendency toward a higher  inflammatory response after arthritis induction than WT mice \[normal mice\]. Further,  arthritis-induced joint destruction was significantly stronger in mice  with M3R deficiency, indicating that stimulation of M3R might have  protective effects on arthritis](https://href.li/?https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4719200/).” More or less this seems to mean that when the action of acetylcholine is blocked, which is what happens when you kill the receptor (and when you block it with anticholinergic drugs), the joint tissue is worse off and more inflamed. Thus acetlycholine appears to be necessary for healthy tissue, and without it the tissue is worse.

In healthy people an anticholinergic drug may not cause any noticeable problems, but in people with collagen disorders who have a preexisting synthesis and weakness issue, it could drastically compound the existing problems, or even incite symptoms that didn’t previously exist. As far as I’m aware, we don’t actually know the mechanism of why collagen is weaker in any collagen disorders; it’s possible that acetylcholine differences could be a reason, and if they are, then drugs that block the action of that would naturally make the problem worse. 

**Does anyone know if this is indeed an established thing, that healthy collagen does require acetylcholine and that anticholinergics cause weaker tissue?**

Text: I was thinking about how an exoskeleton would work. When we're injured, our bodies have ways of sealing and healing that break. But if an invertebrate suffers a break in their exoskeleton, does it seal the way our skin can? Or does everything leak out? For segmented species, are the segments sealed off from each other to prevent that? 

Since they have no skin with sensing nerves, do they register pain the same way we do? Do they bruise? Can they suffer the equivalent of sprained or torn muscles or ligaments, and can they heal from that? If so, how?

(I promise this is research for a book, I'm not some weird insert sadist.)

Text: I was thinking about how the vast majority of plants rely on endosymbiotic fungi (mycorrhyzae) but it seems like most animal-fungi relationships are strictly predatory/parasitic (eg: cordyceps, yeast infections, athlete's foot). I've heard off-hand mention of fungi in our guts being native to that ecosystem, but I can't find anything describing them as beneficial besides &quot;promoting immune system development&quot;. Yeah, that would technically be beneficial, but it's nowhere near as important as mycorrhyzae or other cross-kingdom relationships like coral and algae, spotted salamanders and their algae, and the tons of bacterial-animal relationships.

TLDR: Are fungi and animals just not compatible or did I miss an example? If they aren't compatible, why are fungi cool with plants?

PS: I'm specifically asking about fungi living in/on animals in a literally inseperable relationship. Farmed fungi, like those associated with leaf cutter ants, or fungi that use animals animals as spore dispersers, such as stinkhorns, don't count.

Text: I have an informational calendar that for the month of October reads: &quot;Insects are an ancient group of organisms: they first evolved around 450 million years ago.&quot;

I feel like I see this phrasing a lot, where some organism is described as having evolved circa a specific time in the past. But evolution isn't an event, it's a process that's constantly ongoing, and I've always felt this kind of wording implies, in this example, &quot;and then suddenly there were insects&quot;. 

Would it be more appropriate to say that this is the time period for which we have the oldest evidence of the existence of what most people would recognize as an insect? Is it a period of unusually rapid change where the ancestors of insects began to acquire features that we consider insects to have, like exoskeletons, multiple limbs, antennae, whatever? Or something else entirely?

And, related, if any science educators or evolutionary biologists find themselves weighing in here, are there better ways to convey this information? Evolution is a very complex topic that's by no mean easy to reduce to packets of digestible knowledge, but in the interest of scientific literacy it feels like this kind of phrasing does a disservice to what the concept of evolution attempts to describe.

Text: I cant post a picture here. But my text book says that John Mayow discovered that on part of the air was used to keep animals and flames alive. The book says he discovered this because when he put a mouse on a little stand (so he wouldn't drown) inside a bowl of water, and then covered the mouse and stand with a jar, the water inside the jar rose up above the water outside the jar (I assume they are implying it rose to compensate for the oxygen being used up).

But I would think the CO2 would replace the O2 and there wouldn't be a vacuum situation. 

It is in my Exploring Pearson Textbook for year 8. 

I can't find anything online about this experiment.

Text: Reading the Blind Watchmaker, I came across this paragraph which put me thinking.

&quot;Could the human eye have arisen directly from something slightly different from itself, something that we may call X?

If the answer to this question for any particular degree of difference is no, all we have to do is repeat the question for a smaller degree of difference. Carry on doing this until we find a degree of difference sufficiently small to give us a ‘yes’ answer.&quot;

My doubt is simply: if this degree of difference becomes so insignificantly small, could natural selection still &quot;distinguish&quot; between such minimal fitness in order to select for it?

Or is it that, on average, even such a small degree of difference is enough to propagate over time through natural selection, provided there is at least a minimal increase in fitness?

He goes on to state that children who have had a bad experience in the first two months and then only positive experiences for the next 12 years have worse outcomes than children in the opposite situation.

This struck me as something that would be really hard to test. How many children are really out there that bad experiences only for the first two months of their lives? How were we able to know they had bad experiences then when the children were unable to recall what happened to them?

For most two month olds isn't virtually every experience a negative one? Everything is new and scary when experienced for the first time, how would you be able to tell which/how many experiences were and were not traumatic for the child?

Text: Hi Reddit! We are Simone Li (/u/simone_s_li), Sebastian Schmidt (/u/TSBSchm), Nicolai Karcher (/u/YummyYam123) and Daniel Podlesny (/u/DanielPodlesny). We are lead authors on three independent, recently published studies on microbiome dynamics following fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT, aka stool transplants). Ask Us Anything!

An FMT is the transfer of stool from a donor to a recipient, usually to improve the recipient's health. FMTs are an increasingly popular intervention in different diseases, ranging from recurrent infection with C. difficile (where clinical success rates are &gt;90%) all the way to autism. Yet while FMTs seem to &quot;work&quot; well in some people and diseases, clinical effects are meagre in others and the reasons for this remain very incompletely understood. For a broader introduction to FMT, check out wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_microbiota_transplant.

As FMT targets the gut microbiome, it is generally thought that clinical success depends on the successful engraftment of &quot;good&quot; microbes from the donor and decolonization of &quot;bad&quot; microbes from the recipient. However, what really happens to the microbiome following an FMT, and whether outcomes can be predicted in advance (for example, to pick suitable donors for every recipient) has remained unclear. We represent three independent research teams who tackled this problem by analysing data from several independent trials where FMTs were conducted for different diseases: we used metagenomic data (i.e. DNA sequences directly from stool samples) to track microbes between donors and recipients. We developed models to predict whether donor microbes would colonize or recipient microbes persist after the intervention, and we used this information to pinpoint the factors that determine these outcomes. Broadly speaking, all three teams made similar observations: microbiome dynamics after FMT were somewhat predictable, and there is a limited list of factors that drive outcomes - most of them are on the recipient's side, meaning that choice of a &quot;matching&quot; donor seems less relevant than previously thought.

Text: I saw a video recently by some guy named Dennis Prager. It was basically him talking about things like Western civilization, Judeo-Christian values and the like. But one thing he mentioned that stood out to me was the idea that since more and more people are becoming nonreligious or atheist, the murder and suicide rates (at least in America) have been on the rise. And he implies there is a causation/correlation. Just curious if he's right.

Text: Reading about North Korea’s missile that landed in the Pacific Ocean and the US and South Korea’s joint bombing exercises on an uninhabited island got me thinking. Has there been a build up of certain toxic metals or substances in area because of things like this? Are there perhaps some unexplored bombs or missiles in the ocean? These kinds of tests have been happening for decades so I imagine we are seeing some kind of long term impacts because of them.

Text: This is a question I've been thinking about for a few months but never really knew who to ask so I'm wondering if this is the right place! 

Obviously aeroplanes are really noisy, and after I've (and im sure everyone else) has been on a flight then for short period of time afterwards my ears feel blocked, my hearing is decreased and i overall feel a bit groggy. It's the same after ive been to any loud event like concerts or whatever. 

On my last few flights ive worn my earbuds which have a noise cancelling feature. i (think) i understand the basic science behind this feature, that the earbuds record whats going on around me and inverts the wavelength then plays it back to me, cancelling out the noise entirely. after this, my ears dont feel blocked at all after a flight 

how is this? i understand i cant actually hear the loud aeroplane noises, but surely the loud wavelengths are still entering my eardrums even if my brains being tricked into thinking theyr not. so does this mean the deafening isnt a result of the actual wavelengths or physics, but is instead neurological cause my brains been too used to loud noises for a period of time and cant understand quiet ones for a bit? i dont understand this at all but its been puzzling me so id love if anyone has an explanation

Even in subsonic conditions, a flame can get blown out at high gas speed (I am not sure why). My brain hurts...

Text: This might be a bit of a weird question, but hopefully you can bear with me. From what I understand, AI image generators are based off of training a neural network on a whole bunch of images and then being able to recall bits of them and combine them into new images. This is supposed to be analogous to how our neurons work and how our imagination would draw from our memories to create new images.

So one thing I noticed was that it is easy to imagine an image, say an image of the letter A. It is also very easy to imagine it rotated 90 degrees so that it is sideways. However, it seems to me that AI image generators probably can't produce rotated versions of their memories. From what I understand the images are remembered all in specific orientations relative to each other, and so unless it was fed pictures of sideways A's there wouldn't be any way for it to derive rotated A's from images of upright A's.

I tried putting things like &quot;sideways letter A&quot;, &quot;rotated letter A&quot;, and &quot;letter A on its side&quot; in Dall-E, but it always only ever turned out A's the right way up. The closest I could get was &quot;tree on its side&quot;, but that just made pictures of trees that had fallen over, not making a rotated picture out of an upright memory. I don't think there we need to have seen pictures of a sideways A or tree to imagine it.

Obviously our brain can recognize the edges between objects and some more advanced stuff, which I'd guess are also possible for neural networks if they were designed for it, but the only possibility for rotating images that I'm aware of is using abstract math. From what I understand, rotating an object is something that involves things like complex numbers, vectors, or linear algebra, so not the simplest kinds of math. I guess I have a hard time understanding how our brain could be doing math like that without us consciously being aware of it, or how something like that could evolve in the first place. It seems like you would need a pretty specific arrangement of neurons to act like logic gates to do more advanced math, which I don't think neural networks are capable of. If there is math like this going on, where is it happening?

There's probably a very obvious answer to this question, but I appreciate people humoring me.

Text: I was reading about the strong force and color confinement recently, but everything I read seemed to only talk about an isolated nucleon.  

A brief reading of the Nuclear Force (the binding force between nucleons) which can be viewed as a &quot;residual strong force&quot; indicates it is mediated by virtual mesons.  To my completely uneducated mind, that reads as though the nuclear force is almost like nucleons swapping quarks between one another (as a meson is a quark-antiquark pair). 

I'm assuming I'm reading too much into it and letting my uninformed imagination run a bit too wild.  Because my loose understanding of virtual particles is that they're just a byproduct of random fluctuations in the quantum fields.  But then that makes me think that maybe it doesn't make sense to say that a nucleon has &quot;ownership&quot; over its quarks at all, if its quarks can't really be distinguished.  Which only furthers my question of if each nucleon is clearly a separate entity while in a nucleus or not.

Text: Was there anything special about how NASA designed DART to get the most efficient energy transfer when crashing into Dimorphos? For example, if they put more mass in the front (impacting side) of the spacecraft then I would assume it would transfer more energy into the asteroid. This is because there would be less absorption of energy as it crunches during the impact. But if they put more mass in the rear side then they would lose some energy as it accordions before the rear comes into contact.

Or does this even makes sense to take into consideration because of how fast DART was flying/it being just a proof of concept?

Text: Information in metamorphic rocks

Hi guys. Italian science teacher here. I'm about to have classes on geology and with my biology background sometimes i find it difficult to craft a whole lesson out of the basic things i know. But let my cut to the chase.

I am trying to talk about rocks in terms of what information geologists can sqeeze out of them, then try to use that information as an opener for explaining cool stuff like tectonics and such. For example i showed igneous rocks and their connection with paleomagnetism (so that i can take that thing for granted when we will discuss the midatlantic ridge), and i talked about sedimentary rocks in terms of stratigraphy (that will come in handy often later on).

Now... what about metamorphic rocks? I just know that they lose information on fossils at the microscopic level, or i could point out that scists (not sure if i spelled it correctly in english) have an orientation dependent on the direction of the force that generated them, but this seems just details to me.

Do you have a bigger idea to throw at me? Thanks in advance (and sorry if my grammar and/or geology aren't sound)

Ciao!

Text: 
The question is how can some viruses that aren’t chronic take so long time (Years) for the body to fight off? 

So Virus generally to my understanding are just blindly trying to multiply. Our immune defense is trying to stop this. 
In normal sickness the virus multiplies but after a short while be it a few days or weeks the body’s defense turns the tide and the virus is defeated. The other extreme is the virus goes rampant and then kills the victim as the defenses failed to hold back the virus. 
I understand in chronic cases the virus is able to go dormant and hide to avoid the immune defence to at times wake up and cause a new outbreak. But the outbreaks gets defeated just so the dormant virus isn’t found and exterminated. 
But there are viruses that lasts for a long time where the virus still gets defeated permanently. How come it takes so long time yet never the virus takes totally over or the immune defense does? Is it a long time of “stalemate” where the replication of virus is about as large as the immune defence can keep up killing it, causing a “stable” state. Take HPV warts for example. They have strains that aren’t “permanent” but can take years before fought off. 

Is some of my understanding wrong or how come it take so long? What happens after years that suddenly tips the tide? And how come if it isn’t defeated before then it doesn’t spread more? Like I’m case of HPV to all skin cells?

Stranger still, is the fact that objects which have been contaminated, somehow &quot;lose&quot; radiation stuck to them over time! Yes, I read somewhere about half-life of elements and whatnot, but what does a half-life of uranium-238 for example, have to do with the radiation that it gave off which in turn stuck to something? Radiation is not the element itself, it is energy, so how can it &quot;decay&quot; like the element that originated it?

Text: Obviously the air we breathe is made up of multiple molecules. When the air heats up or cools down is there a certain molecule that has the most effect on that temperature change? If you could separate all of the molecules that make up our air and check their temperature would they all be the same or different?

Text: Low-stakes question about fasting blood work here. Does the length of the fasting time affect the data significantly? I was wondering because I ended up fasting for close to 14 hrs before having blood work done (I was stranded on a broken-down metro car for 2 hours trying to  get to the clinic, heh). A lot of my values were in the normal range but borderline. I was wondering if the extra-long fasting time could have affected things, and if it’s likely the values would have been outside of the normal range if I had fasted for the usual amount of time. Like, if the values drop at a rate of X units/hr, perhaps letting it go for a couple of extra hours could have falsely pushed them down into the normal range….? Is there any data looking at that kind of thing? Or is it generally assumed not to matter too much?

Text: I understand that a molecule is classified as a steroid if it contains the four-ring core circled [here](https://i.imgur.com/3DXfYJB.png). I'm wondering, why is this a common or significant property for an organic compound to have? 

Does this core structure interact with other molecules in a specific way? Is the core structure common because of how it's synthesized?

Thanks in advance for any insight!

Text: I've been thinking about this for awhile but I couldn't find many resources about it online. My reasoning is: every human has certain dimensions/proportions (let's say an IPD of 63-66mm); some of them are in the &quot;ideal&quot; range, whereas others are under (IPD=60mm) or over (IPD=71mm) it. However, if we took the average of all humans for each feature, the people who are over and people who are under would cancel out and the end result for average human (or maybe average male and average female separately) would fit all the ideal metrics. This is kind of similar reasoning to &quot;Wisdom of the Crowd&quot; (see: [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom\_of\_the\_crowd](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd)) phenomenon, but rather than a crowd's intellect, it's a crowd's (species') physical attractiveness.

One resource I did manage to find was this:

[https://www.artfido.com/this-is-what-the-average-person-looks-like-in-each-country/](https://www.artfido.com/this-is-what-the-average-person-looks-like-in-each-country/)

This is very nearly what I am going for, just couldn't find one for the entire earth. I am also not sure how accurate that website is. But, assuming it is accurate, you'll notice all the faces (male &amp; female) are all very good looking and far more attractive than what you'd probably consider &quot;average&quot;. This is a result of the &quot;cancelling of error&quot; that I mentioned above.

Text: I saw a picture of a refrigerator that had floated and flipped over during the recent hurricane. My dad said he was surprised it would float away, particularly cause the  heavy mechanicals are at the bottom of the refrigerator, but i told him i dont think thats relevant.

So heres the hypothetical scenario. We have two refrigerator sized prisms standing side by side and the water level is steadily rising. Object A has a big lead weight sitting inside, at the bottom, while object B has the same lead weight, but it is located towards the top of the object. The weight and volume of the two objects is otherwise identical. The two objects are mostly hollow and can float in water. As the water level rises, at some point these objects begin to lift off the ground. Will one lift off the ground before the other, or will they both lift off the ground at the same time?

Thanks for any replies.

Text: I'm curious about the physical forces that act on a quantum particle that collapse it down to one state, and the relationship between these forces and the observers knowledge or measurement.

I assume it's possible for a person to subject particles to these forces so as to collapse the particle down to one state without gaining any knowledge about the particle. For example, by not looking at the monitor or not recording the measurement made by the device. Is that the case? 

Is there any theoretical way of measuring these objects through different means which do not subject the particles to such forces?

Or is their state inextricably linked to an observer's knowledge about them?

Text: I'm not sure if I worded the question appropriately, but what I'm actually asking about is how the process that &quot;determines&quot; how an individual atom reacts chemically is works (to the extent that we know). I understand that the proton count is just set definitionally, but I'm asking to what extent we're aware of the actual changes that cause chemical property shifts in individual atoms. A lot of the answers (including one in this sub) were unsatisfactory, as they all deal with why it is defined that way and not the underlying process that leads it to be. More simply (maybe?), what is the *explanation* for the correlation between protons and chemical properties?

However, it is known that gibbons and humans both have variants for both A and B blood types, and those variants come from a common ancestor that lived 20 million years ago. Then doesn't it mean blood type AB existed at least before 16th century, while AB is just a mixture of A and B?

Which one is correct? What is the scholars' mainstream opinion about it now?

Text: Whenever you burn wood, plants, or other organic material, the residual carbon becomes black ash. However, if you continue to burn that material, eventually the ashes will turn white. What are the mechanisms involved in further combustion of the material that result in the ash changing from a compound which essentially absorbs all photons in the visible spectrum making it appear black, to a compound that largely scatters light in the visible spectrum appearing white?

That's how craters form as far as I know, so if NASA can alter the trajectory of a much larger body with a much smaller impact, why didn't this crater cause this Moon to leave Jupiter's orbit? What's keeping the Earth from sliding out of orbit around the sun the more often we launch spacecraft from it? Isn't every tiny force against the earth moving it out of its orbit? Because of the relationship of objects in a gravity well aren't we moving the Sun and potentially destabilizing that too, however an insignificant amount? Could many years of spaceships launching from the same place on Earth at the same time of year/day/force angle cause it to lose its stable orbit? Eventually?

Text: I thought of this while telling my dog she wouldn’t even know what to do with a piece of molten hot potato that she was begging for.

I remember reading before that the advent of cooking was an inflection point in our evolution, and that we had evolved some traits (e.g. smaller teeth and jaws) likely in response to the change in diet once our food started to come cooked. It got me thinking: if cooked food placed enough evolutionary pressure for “cost-saving” traits like our less beefy chewing muscles, could it have been enough to push something like better responses to thermal burns in order to minimize losing access to food. Surely the risk of being unable to eat is enough of a driver for some change, and the burning risk that comes from a piece of meat fresh out of the fire would be a new environmental aspect that we hadn’t had to deal with before. If enough time has passed that we’ve since been able to evolve other known traits, it seems possible that an improved healing mechanism could also be present compared to other species.

Text: So current genetic testing of IVF embryos is to get the egg and sperm together, make a bunch of embryos, wait a few days to see which ones grow and then to pop them open, scrape out a bunch of cells and then send them to the lab. The lab then tests those cells for any abnormalities (aneuploidy, etc) while the embryos get frozen. Once results are back the cleared embryos can be implanted one at a time until one takes.

So there has been some research on childhood cancer risk of frozen embryos and that seems to be a bit elevated relative to standard - 1.6-1.7 times.

https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1004078

This is still a fairly new process and we don’t know if there are any impacts later in life from freezing, it’s an open question as frozen embryo children hit middle age. Fingers crossed.

My question was on the genetic testing side. If you have an embryo and pop it open and remove a bunch of the very first cells, then the remaining cells step up and still deliver a baby. That is established. What impacts might arise from the cell removal process though? Like if you were going to have 100 cells at that point and are now down to 90 or whatever then would that have any impacts later in life? The remaining cells need to divide more I guess. Thoughts?

Text: Let's focus on a ground or low air burst. Nuclear fallout describes the radioactive contamination of particles that got pulled up into the atmosphere by the hot air and fall down eventually and spread out with the wind. But say you were caught at the edge of a nuclear blast and followed basic &quot;duck and cover&quot; procedures. you wait for the pressure and backdraught to pass and immmediately take protecrive measures afterwards. did you get (significantly) contaminated with radionucleids even before the first fallout comes from above?

Do all viruses have different transmission mechanisms? How has the science of virus transmission study evolved since 2018?

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for 'X' were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;.

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed.

I would have expected some uncertainty, and a bigger than predicted effect would seem like a good thing, but this seems like a big difference.  It's apparently because of the amount debris, &quot;hurled out into space, creating a comet-like trail of dust and rubble stretching several thousand miles.&quot;  Does this discrepancy really mean that knowing its mass and trajectory aren't enough to predict what sort of strike will generate the necessary change in trajectory of an asteroid?  Will we also have to be able to predict the extent and nature of fragmentation?  Does this become a structural problem, too?

Text: More specifically, I’ve heard that smokers’ children have a higher risk of asthma and respiratory infections and that they are affected through passive smoking (also when the smoker just breathes after having smoked recently) and through epigenetics, but it seems a bit unbelievable.

If true, what is the pathophysiology of this? Do they have less mucus and more debris in the respiratory tract or something like that?

Are smokers’ children more likely to have a worse sense of smell or no sense of smell?

Are smokers’ children more likely to be infected with typical viruses that go under the “common cold” term?

I’ve also heard that smokers’ grandchildren are affected through epigenetics. How exactly are they affected?

Text: Hello /r/AskScience! Dinosaur mummies preserve skin and other soft tissues, but how they fossilize has always been a bit of a quandry. It's generally thought that very rapid burial is required to protect remains from predators, scavengers, and other agents of decomposition. However, they often also appear desiccated, which usually takes long-term exposure on the landscape.

Recent preparation on the Edmontosaurus mummy &quot;Dakota&quot; revealed the first evidence of predator activity on dinosaurian soft tissues and provided an alternate explanation for how these rare fossils form. You can read [our recent publication](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0275240) in PLOS One.

**Ask us your questions about Dakota the Dinomummy, how fossils are formed and what goes into fossil preparation!**

**Stephanie Drumheller** (/u/UglyFossils) is a paleontologist at the University of Tennessee whose research focuses on the processes of fossilization, evolution, and biology, of crocodiles and their relatives, including identifying bite marks on fossils. Find her on Twitter @UglyFossils.

**Becky Barnes** (/u/ScientistGinkgo) is paleontologist and Lab Manager of the Johnsrud Paleontology Lab, with the ND Geological Survey. She worked on preparing part of the tail, foot, and body block of Dakota the Dinomummy.

**Clint Boyd** (/u/PalaeoBoyd) is the Senior Paleontologist at the North Dakota Geological Survey and Curator of the North Dakota State Fossil Collection. His research focus in on ornithischian dinosaurs, including specimens of Edmontosaurus like Dakota the Dinomummy.

**Mindy Householder** (/u/Mindles1308) is a fossil preparator with the State Historical Society of North Dakota. She prepared the right arm, portions of the left foot, helped with parts of the tail, and is currently preparing the body block of Dakota the Dinomummy.

Text: A while ago I noticed how the color of objects gets progressively darker the dimmer the light source is, up until everything looking completely black if there's none, at least to our eyes. And then i also realized this happens the same the other way around, as if the light source is bright enough, it can make objects look completely white.   


And this effect is a spectrum, you can make an object go from black to white by going from no light source to a really strong one. So then, how can we really determine the *true* color of things? or if there even is one? a &quot;red&quot; jacket can go from a bordeaux color in dim light to a more crimson tone in brighter light, what color is the jacket, objectively?

Text: Google says its for camouflage. I find that hard to believe. 

I understand that in the case of zebras who are fast and travel in large herds of almost 1000 individuals, I see their camouflage patterns work well. 

Unlike zebras, giraffe bodies taper towards their necks, it's not hard to count and target a giraffe, even when they travel in a herd. And this herd size is around just 20 animals. 

Are these spots really for camouflage coz I don't see it working.

Text: I have a couple of questions about vaccines inspired by the ongoing pandemic:

1. With endemic viruses, whether it be covid-19 or influenza, that we are more or less perpetually “chasing” because they mutate too quickly for vaccines to keep up, would it make sense to use predictive modeling to determine what mutations would most likely be present, say, a year from now, and engineer vaccines based on those predictions? So by using a vaccine that is essentially a cocktail of current and predicted strains, perhaps we could catch up to the virus?

2. Somewhat in line with the first question, how -valent can a vaccine be? I have seen up to 13-valent vaccines just from a cursory Google search, but what is the limit on the number of strains one vaccine could have, and what about the human immune system limits that number?

Text: I just discovered on Wikipedia that, contrary to my intuition, deer, moose, giraffes, camels, and sheep are all only very distantly related to horses. The former are all Artiodactyla while horses are Perissodactyla. This is rather strange to me because they look very similar and certainly more similar than a moose and an orca do (apparently orcas are also Artiodactyla). How is it possible that orcas and moose are more related than horses and moose?

Edit: For clarification, I understand how phylogeny works based on shared ancestry, not morphology. What I am more interested in is any more in-depth background on how the decision was made to classify ungulates based on toe parity, and perhaps anything on how exactly orcas fit into this.

Text: As far as I know, cancer appears when random cells in your body mutate and refuse to die, then multiplying into other cancerous cells, and so on until they invade the nearby tissues.

Any damage to cells may increase the risk of cancer because with every cell division, there is a risk of an error that can give birth to a cancerous cells. More division, greater chances of errors.

Giving blood depletes the body of a insane amount of cells, cells that need to be replaced by the body via division. Does this increase the risk of a error occuring during the division that could give birth to a cancerous cell?

EDIT:  I saw a reply in my email that doesn't seem to appear here.  Someone mentioned that it could be dangerous to drink a liquid that was below the freezing point of water because it could cause body parts to freeze.  I am looking for a modest decrease in freezing point, around 10-20F below the normal freezing point which shouldn't be much more dangerous than drinking an alcoholic drink that's below 32F or chewing ice.

The purpose of this inquiry is to make a sports drink that could be kept liquid below 32F

Text: I'm currently working on propagating mycelium from agar onto sterilized hydrated grain, and keep running into contamination by B. Subtilis (I am almost certain of this ID).

One of the sources I'm considering is contaminated agar, as the rhizomorphic mycelium I use now started from a culture that had contamination in one area.

From what I've read, it looks like this bacterium spreads via wet surfaces by swimming, or the spores fly through the air. I also suspect contamination through the air, as the innoculation wasn't in a flow hood.

Is it possible that B. Subtilis can dig into and embed itself in solidifed agar, or is it more likely that the airborne spores got into my grains?

Ethyl butyrate has a boiling point of about 120°C and 1-Propanol 97°C.
But ethyl butyrate peaks first? I’ve run them separately too…but shouldn’t it be the other way around?

Text: If I understand things correctly, basically all wireless communicatiom happens via electromagnetic waves outside of the visual spectrum. But I was taught that waves (of the same type) interfere with each other when they meet. Seeing as light is also just an electromagnetic wave, it should also interefere with any wireless signal, thus altering the signal, making it impossible to decode correctly. This should, as I understand it, happen with literally every single wireless signal in a given area, creating a giant jumbled mess that would end up giving noone any of the things they were using their wireless signal for. Am I fundamentally misunderstanding something here? I am genuinely confused.

Text: Let me lead off by saying I *am* aware of the equation for this. I'm confused by some of the details. I've been trying to learn a thing or two about rocket engines and I'm struggling to pick apart this particular question.

So in the combustion chamber you've got an initial temperature and pressure (etc.) which are basically a function of the reactants you are using. These determine the area of the throat, which is sized so that you get sonic flow at that choke point. You need the A\* that gives M=1 at the throat.

But I'm confused about what determines the shape and size of the nozzle after that... Here's a few things I do understand:

* The propellant shifts to supersonic after the throat. Velocity increases as the area expands.
* Temperature and pressure drop as velocity increases.
* Ideally, you want the pressure at exit to be equal to ambient pressure. (This is mainly about efficiency?)
* The exact shape (and length?) isn't super important. It's mostly just about weight and cost.

I guess it's that third point is perhaps what has me confused. When I look at the equation for thrust, there's two terms:

1. mass flow rate \* exit velocity
2. exit area \* pressure difference from ambient

Let me assume a fixed mass flow rate. The equation for exit velocity is... basically a function of exit pressure. The other terms are basically all coming directly from your choice of fuel/oxidizer and other initial conditions. The exact term where it appears is `1-Pe/P0` so I think what that's saying is the &quot;ideal&quot; is zero exit pressure? The higher your exist pressure is to the initial pressure at combustion, the less energy you've gotten out of it. And lower exit pressure ultimately requires a larger nozzle exist area.

But then if the exit pressure is too low you start to suffer from the second term. Because if exit pressure is lower than ambient this term goes negative.

Am I right in understanding that this is the tricky balance you need to strike? And shooting for Pe=Pa is where it happens to be optimized for thrust?

After eliminating other possibilities, I'm left with the hypothesis that my soundbar is producing some annoying or frightening noise in some ultrasonic frequency — a frequency that I can't hear, but my cat can. (I'd like to find out for sure, but ultrasound microphones are apparently expensive, and I'm not sure how to capture the audio coming from one.)

Do many electronic or mechanical devices produce incidental operational vibrations at ultrasonic frequencies? If we could hear these higher frequencies, would our constructed environments — cities especially — seem especially &quot;noisy&quot; in these frequencies? Are there any product standards or government regulations intended to limit ultrasonic &quot;noise pollution&quot;?

Text: This [wonderful little video](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/comments/ybl6xn/ibex/) has been going around and got to a friend and I discussing how much a burden those horns must be, simply by weight. Looking it up, it seems those glorious horns can weigh up to 15 kilos! That seems like a lot of extra top-heavy weight to carry around. 

So we were debating how the animal would have to evolve for it. What difference do we see in similar animals with and without such astounding headwear?

Do knee ligaments or your Achilles tendon go from perfectly fine to torn from something like that? Or does the injury actually build up over time with small tears or something.

If so, is or could there be anything done to know in advance someone is at risk for this injury or restore/repair their ligament.  

If not what would make the one time a person hurt their ACL while running, which didn't look particularly violent, different than any other that didn't cause the injury?

Text: I am [Doctor Mark Horowitz](https://markhorowitz.org/) MBBS PhD, and I am a psychiatric researcher in the National Health Service in England, an honorary researcher at University College London and training psychiatrist. My research has been concerned with how to safely stop psychiatric medications based on understanding their effects on the brain - and the technique I have developed, called [hyperbolic tapering](https://www.thelancet.com/article/S2215-0366(19)30032-X/fulltext), has been adopted as [guidance](https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mental-health/treatments-and-wellbeing/stopping-antidepressants) for the public by the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the UK. This research came out of my own awful experience coming off antidepressants. I run a clinic in the public health service in London to help people safely stop psychiatric drugs for anxiety and depression and find that many people who could not stop their medication in the 'old-fashioned' ways are able to do so safely in my clinic, now supported by studies using similar techniques.

I am also a co-author of the recent umbrella review assessing the validity of the serotonin hypothesis ('chemical imbalance') in depression, published in [Molecular Psychiatry](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01661-0). While many psychiatrists say this is old news, research suggests that over 80% of the public still believe in the chemical imbalance theory, and many companies and healthcare bodies still promote it on their websites.

In North America, I have co-founded a company called [Outro Health](https://www.outro.health/), which brings this gradual, supported and hyperbolic approach to people in Canada and the US, so that people will have the support they need (and which I did not have!). I will be on at 12pm US EST (16 UT) for 3 hours. AMA!

Text: There have been recents posts on the disinterest American males have on having children in /r/science (among other places). Conversely, I was just reading about the difficulties in policing child labor in Bangladesh.

We know that, generally speaking, as a country becomes more affluent, birth rates decline. So it made me wonder how much economic factors are playing a role in birth rates globally.

An often cited reason for people to not want children in the United States is that they are expensive and that they don't think that raising children would make them happy.

Intuitively, it seems to me that those in extreme poverty could be having children potentially due to the fact that they will provide income to the parents and the closest thing the parents can get to a retirement plan. But is that true? Are economics (or personal finance, I suppose you could say) really a major motivating factor in the choice to have children worldwide?

Text: Hello,

I would like to start off by saying I know this is a dumb question, but I cannot find the answer anywhere else on the internet, and I would really appreciate some help. I basically don't understand the statement, &quot;*when sufficient energy is crammed into a sufficiently small space, particles that were not previously present can sometimes be created out of that energy.&quot;* This quote is from this article:

[**https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/particle-physics-why-do-it-and-why-do-it-that-way/**](https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/particle-physics-why-do-it-and-why-do-it-that-way/)

The article is from a website, Of Particular Significance, by Matt Strassler. Really cool website for those particle physics geeks out there, and can accomodate all knowledge levels. I posted a comment last June, but since I have still received no response (*ahem* Matt), I have taken matters into my own hands. Below is the original comment, commented under Vector Hugo.

So, this sentence really confused me at first, “It is a remarkable property of nature that when sufficient energy is crammed into a sufficiently small space, particles that were not previously present can sometimes be created out of that energy.” I was sitting here with minimal scientific background, and I’m just like, ‘Did the Law of Conservation of Mass AND the Law of Conservation of Energy just go out the window?!!’ Anyways, after reading the comments, I grew a better understanding and addition to more questions. Am I interpreting this the right way? Why are these laws still taught in schools? More importantly: HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE???thank you

I'd like to thank anyone that took the time to respond or to just read some responses. Any comments/further questions are appreciated!!

Text: I'm a nursing student, and I'm currently studying my second physiology unit. My materials all say that when a blood vessel is damaged, vasoconstriction occurs to reduce the pressure and flow of blood, so that the platelet plug is not dislodged. This mostly makes sense to me, however it's my understanding that vasoconstriction means the same amount of blood flows through a smaller opening, thereby INCREASING blood pressure. Is there a different mechanism in place during haemostasis? Is the constriction occurring proximally to the clot, reducing the volume of blood? Is the heart output of blood changed? I can see the heart rate increasing in major injuries, thus lowering blood pressure, but what about for minor injuries?

Text: Say Juliet wins two state lotteries back to back in 1999.

A person who thinks it was rigged might say &quot;Well, the probability of her winning two state lotteries back to back is infinitesimally low. Therefore she probably rigged it.&quot;

A person who looks at the broader scope of lotteries might say &quot;Well, the probability of someone winning two state lotteries at some time is much higher. This is explainable by chance and the lottery being rigged isn't necessary.&quot;

The second is a logically weaker description of the first. It &quot;seems&quot; more correct, but is it? What is the justification for it? Many would say that the second description seems more relevant, but why? Why is it exactly more relevant?

Curiously, one can construct logically stronger and logically weaker versions of the same exact sequence of events, and yet...each would have wildly different probabilities. For example, these descriptions go from logically strong to logically weak:

1. What is the probability that Juliet decided to play two New Jersey state lotteries, won two state lotteries, and won it at 9 PM? (assuming it was announced then)
2. What is the probability that Juliet won two New Jersey state lotteries?
3. What is the probability that Juliet won two state lotteries?
4. What is the probability that someone won two state lotteries?
5. What is the probability that someone won two lotteries?
6. What is the probability that some rare meaningful event in the world occurs?
7. What is the probability that an event occurs?

The last statement almost seems like a tautology, and yet, can one come up with a satisfactory answer as to why it's not relevant here? Which description is most relevant?

Text: According to a Wikipedia article on tropical rainforests climates, &quot;When tropical rainforest climates are more dominated by the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) than the trade winds (and with no or rare cyclones), so usually located near the equator, they are also called equatorial climates. Otherwise, when they are more dominated by the trade winds than the ITCZ, they are called tropical trade-wind climates. In pure equatorial climates, the atmospheric pressure is almost constantly low so the horizontal pressure gradient is low. Consequently, the winds are rare and usually weak (except sea and land breezes in coastal areas) while **in tropical trade-wind climates, often located at higher latitudes than the equatorial climates, wind is almost permanent which incidentally explains why rainforest formations are impoverished compared to those of equatorial climates due to their necessary resistance to strong winds accompanying tropical disturbances.&quot;** Does this mean that in places such as Central America, Hawaii, and the Philippines, which have rainforests that are farther from the equator, (above 10 degrees North latitude) the trees are generally not as tall?

Text: So I was watching a report on the effects of Ivermectin treatment for Covid-19 vs a control group. This caused me to wonder about a more drastic medical situation such as the need to test a potential life saving medication for the treatment of something like cancer. I'm a software developer by training and trade, so I have an understanding of the scientific process, but I tend to work in a field where if I make a mistake...no one will die.

So assume I have a new drug that has the potential to be extremely effective at treating cancer. I believe due diligence would require to perform double blind randomized testing with this medication as well as a placebo. At this point, I feel like there's an ethical issue because are we not knowingly taking individuals with a life threatening illness and deliberately giving them a non treatment? I know there are all sorts of nuances to what I'm asking and I'm sure it's not as simple as saying the control group is receiving no treatment. But how do we test life saving medication knowing that part of our group is not going to receive any medication whatsoever? 

Or am I just drastically off base in how medicine is developed and studied?

Edit: wow, thank you everyone! I really appreciate the great responses! It all makes a lot more sense to me now.

In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for 'X' were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;.

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

Text: Hi everyone, 

I'm designing an EDF with little experience in aerodynamics (but enough in fluid mechanics). I have attempted to use blade element theory to calculate some parameters; however, it falls apart if I approximate inlet axial velocity as zero. I know the propeller induces some axial flow, but I do not know how much.

My question is: 

Is there a way to calculate the inlet axial flow velocity, if propeller power, diameter and thrust are known?

Thanks for any help.

Text: It is my understanding that xray tubes are kind of like a light bulb, just with thousands of volts. How are the manufacturers able to &quot;set&quot; the frequency? Is it a result of the specific material used in the filament? The gas used around it? The voltage? Let's say someone wanted to change the frequency from 1*10^18hz to 1.1*10^18hz. Would there be a way to do this without having to change out the filament? 

Also, I'm guessing the tubes don't emit just a perfect x ray frequency, but probably a range of frequencies. Is this true? Is it emitting a broad spectrum like any/all frequencies from the range of A to B, or does it output in &quot;peaks&quot; like the ionization of gasses?

I use an xray and work and was talking to a technician from the manufacturer today and it got me thinking.

Text: I've been trying to delve deeper into chemistry &amp; physics lately and one thing I've learned about is electromagnetism and strong force. To my current understanding protons, and generally things with opposing charges, repel one another. This alone would cause protons to fly away from one another until nuclear strong force comes in. If I'm not mistaken nuclear strong force is the force between particles in a nucleus that allows them to be bound together, all particles have this property but neutrons to protons is the most important example as it allows a neutron to bind to two protons effectively holding the two together. My subsequent question is then obvious, if particles bind to each other and the neutral force of a neutron means there's no electromagnetic force separating them why don't massive amounts of neutrons accumulate among each other over time creating a mega neutron ball?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm assuming that this question also relates to another question of mine that being &quot;why can't I just bombard unstable isotopes of massive atoms such as oganesson with neutrons until the strong force granted by them eventually overpowers the immense electromagnetic force of all the protons.&quot; As they're both the same question of why doesn't infinitely adding neutrons to a nucleus make it infinitely more stable.

Text: Yesterday I listened to a historian who talked about the Goths. At the beginning he talked about that they don't know much about the beginning of the Goths but that they expect that they lived in what now is Poland. Why they expect that was due to signs of a similar culture found there.
He showed 1 example of such signs, it was a ring of stones (like Stonehenge but way smaller and not stacked) in a forest. The stones were around 0,5m tall and probably artificially rounded on the top.
Afterwards I asked how they know how old those stones are, but he couldn't answer my question.

So that's my question to you. How do they know when those stones were placed there? Because you can't just use the age of the stones, they are way older. Can they find that date from the chipping done in the stones? Or maybe the change in the soil? Or is there something else that is more easy to date found nearby?

Text: i understand that the uud structure of the proton is the lowest allowed energy state of three quarks, and thus it can't decay (supersymmetric theories aside). the neutron, meanwhile, is udd and can (when by itself, or in the right kind of nucleus) undergo beta decay to a proton via spontaneous emission of a massive, charged W boson.

furthermore, i understand that for instance non-spontaneous fission occurs when a neutron of sufficient energy interacts with the nucleus, bringing it to an unstable energy level. u235 is close to this level, and thus fissions when interacting with a neutron of even thermal energy, whereas u238 needs a higher-energy neutron to fission. high-energy photons can furthermore knock nucleons out in photodisintegration.

2.78MeV differentiate the up and down quark. This energy ought be readily available; the excited Ni60 metastate decays with a 1.33MeV γ, about half this value. Why don't we see protons transmuting to neutrons when such gamma rays hit them, especially in e.g. a plasma where there are no electrons to get in the way (at nuclear distance scales)?

sorry, i am merely a dumb computer scientist.

Text: While doing an experiment using germanium semi-conductor detector,  we used a radioactive material, which decays via positron emission. Now, this positron is emitted with some kinetic energy and   when it annihilates an electron, the total energy is higher than rest mass energy of electron+ positron. In order to conserve both energy and momentum, two photons will be emitted. Now my question is, will the wavelength of photon be lesser than 2.4 pm ( which corresponds to both electron and positron being at rest during collision) . 

Although it seems very obvious, that the wavelength should be less than 2.4pm, but while discussing this with my professor, he said a positron won't annihilate an electron unless it is in rest state before it collides with an electron??. Didn't make any sense to me why this should happen? Can somebody explain.

Text: Hello all! Bit of background: I'm a physical chemist by training, and did my doctoral work on self-assembly in conjugated polyelectrolytes. In that field there are open questions about how things like temperature, pH, salt content drive and control self-assembly and processes like liquid-liquid phase separation. I recently came across this [article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33955104/) discussing liquid-liquid phase separation of Tau. I have very marginal knowledge of the state of Alzheimer's research and whether the various hypotheses regarding plaque aggregation are causal or symptomatic. So I'd like to know more about whether the CNS of folks with Alzheimer's varies significantly in its pH and electrolytic balance vs a normative sample of CNS.

For the record: I'm no longer in academia (although I still have journal access) and my industry is semiconductors, not biomedical. So I'm not fishing for competitive advantage in this field.

Text: I've read about a  [biggest cosmic explosion in history](https://nautil.us/brightest-ever-space-explosion-reveals-possible-hints-of-dark-matter-244346/) and it caused photons with at least 18 TeV of energy. Since frequency and energy are connected, it looks like that amount of energy would correspond to approx. 10\^24 Hz, which is unimaginably a lot. The wavelength for this frequency should be on the order of 10\^-16 m. Planck length is 10\^-34 m so there's still a lot of room to go there, but by that logic, there's absolutely a (huge) upper limit for a photon to have. Going backwards, Planck length to frequency, that's 10\^43 Hz and energy of about 7 GJ, or about 10\^16 TeV. Is this reasoning sound? If so, is that the absolute maximum energy a photon can have?

Playing around with numbers, that means each photon has a relativistic mass of 80 ug, which is huge. Is the only thing stopping us from generating photons of such (&quot;maximum&quot;) energy, that there are no particles with that kinds of mass which we could annihiliate?

Text: Since dark matter (seemingly) only interact through gravity, is there any reason it's angular momentum would line up with the rest of matter?  


I'm under the impression that the reason all planets spin the same way around the sun and all the stars spin the same way around the galaxy center is because of collisions with has &quot;evened out&quot; the angular momentum to some average?

Text: A study titled _Antitumor activity of benzaldehyde_ published in _Cancer Treatments Reports_ (ISSN: 0361-5960) in 1980 by Mutsuyuki Kochi et al. (Cancer Treat Rep. 64(1):21-3;1980) claims that out of 57 patients with various inoperable carcinomas, 1/3 (19) were completely cured, while 10 others showed significant improvement (over 50%) over a 2.5 years period of administering beta-cyclodextrin-benz­aldehyde (CDBA) in a certain dosage (~10mg / kg / day)

My question is if you know of any studies which attempted to replicate the original study? Or, absent this, further research using CDBA for treatment of advanced tumours in vivo?

Text: I understand that the pressure in the boundary layer (BL) changes with respect to x and so we have dP/dz=0. Where x is streamwise, y is spanwise, and z is wall-normal. According to my professor, the centripetal acceleration from curvature balances out the pressure gradient, dP/dx=v^(2)/r. In the BL, the velocity decreases at the surface, so the radius of curvature must reduce to compensate for this. This leads to tighter curvature. Is it this smaller curvature that allows pressure to bend the streamline flow to spawn crossflow?

Text: Is there any material capable of forming a surface that is not just opaque or translucent to gamma radiation, but capable of specular reflection, even of perpendicular radiation? How high can the reflectivity get?

EDIT: Can't find reflection per se, but I found something about refraction. It looks like [in 2012 someone at the Max Planck Institute succeeded in building gold lenses?](https://scitechdaily.com/high-energy-radiation-is-refracted-setting-the-stage-for-gamma-optics/)

&gt; Scientists at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich and the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching have opened up a new chapter in optics: in experiments with gamma rays at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble they have proven that these extremely high-energy electromagnetic waves can be focused by lenses like conventional light — the researchers have thus refuted a fundamental assumption of theoretical physics that had been valid for decades. Their discovery will make a great many new applications possible in medicine and materials research, for example.  
&gt; Optical instruments like telescopes and microscopes are based on the refraction of light: in a medium such as glass the electromagnetic waves propagate more slowly than in air or in a vacuum, and are therefore diffracted — for example, onto the focal plane of a photo camera. The refractive index, which depends on the lens material and the frequency of the waves, describes how large this effect is: the more it deviates from 1, the stronger the diffraction of the light beams.  
&gt; Until now, physicists had assumed that electromagnetic radiation with far greater energy than that in the visible spectrum could not be diffracted with lenses. They had calculated that the refractive index in this region of the spectrum is almost precisely 1 for all materials. **However, back in the mid-1990s it turned out that X-rays are also diffracted by beryllium or carbon lenses, and thus that X-ray optics were possible.**  
&gt; When Dietrich Habs, professor at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich and Fellow of the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching, and his team were making their measurements at the ILL they discovered that this also applies to the even higher energy gamma-rays — after X-ray optics, the era of gamma optics is now beginning.

TIL [X-Ray Optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_optics) appear to have been a thing for a while, including [mirrors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_optics#Mirrors_for_X-ray_optics).

Text: I am not a physicist, but am having to brush up on my understanding of magnetism for my biology undergraduate thesis. Thanks in advance for hearing me out:

I am trying to establish **whether a paramagnetic salt** (manganese II chloride) **maintains its paramagnetism when dissolved in a polar, aqueous solution** (at which point, it is assumed that it would dissociate into its constituent ions). In a moment of redneck engineering, we placed a small bar magnet on the side of the manganese II chloride saturated solution, to see whether the ions would re-orient themselves in response to this applied field. **No change was observed in response to this applied field.**

I have a few questions that I'm stumped on:

**1. Does the fraction of lone pair electrons in a paramagnetic substance change dependent on the strength of an applied magnetic field?**

**2. Does the speed at which the electrons relocalize change in response to the magnitude of the applied magnetic field?** (ie. maybe we just didn't wait long enough to observe the change)

**3. If a polar aqueous solution caused the salt to lose its paramagnetism, then would a non-polar aqueous solution allow for paramagnetic retention? Is there a way to test for either of these?**

However, I’ve noticed there seems to be a limitation on the banking angle on public roads as well. Why is this the case?

Text: Just by doing some basic comparisons and looking at high level trends a somewhat obvious (albeit not immediately validated) hypothesis seems to form itself…

yDNA Haplogroup G seems to have originated around the Caucasus region (where the highest diversity and rates of G are found today).

It is also home to the kartvelian language family, seemingly a final bastion from the spread of indo European and Turkic languages. A language family not known to be directly connected to any others, but influenced by indo European.


Since the spread of yDNA G, especially G2a is associated with the spread of farming in Europe and west Asia, it stands to reason that the kartvelian languages could be an offshoot descendant of a larger, older early farmer language family. Possibly similar enough to what the early European farmers would have spoken.

I can’t find anything on this in literature, Wikipedia etc but this seems a somewhat obvious subject to investigate?

I’m interested to hear if anyone knows if this has been proposed in the past or looked into.

Thanks!

Text: If temperature is increased, vapor pressure should increase as well, which means partial pressure of the gas above the liquid increases. And since partial pressure increases, solubility of that gas increases. But increasing temperature also decreases solubility of the gas in liquid. How can solubility both increase and decrease with increasing temperatures?

Text: There have long been concerns about the health risks from artificial sweeteners. For example, recent studies indicate that artificial sweeteners could elevate blood sugar levels and raise one's risk of heart disease or stroke. There have also been reports that they alter our gut biome in harmful ways.  For example this quote ( [Artificial Sweeteners Alter Gut Bacteria in Humans | The Scientist Magazine® (the-scientist.com)](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/artificial-sweeteners-alter-gut-bacteria-in-humans-70395) ):

&quot; Now, working in the lab of Weizmann Institute of Science immunologist Eran Elinav, Suez and colleagues have taken an array of common artificial sweeteners—saccharin, sucralose, aspartame, and stevia—and filled that gap in the literature by testing them in humans. Their findings, described today (August 19) in [*Cell*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.07.016), suggest these sweeteners do indeed alter the gut microbiome, as was seen in prior mouse work. This, the researchers say, adversely impacts glucose tolerance, a measure of how readily the body moves sugar from the blood into muscle and fat, possibly leading to weight gain and diabetes. &quot;

My question is, are &quot;natural&quot; sweeteners such as those based on Monk Fruit (which gets its sweetness from a compound called, &quot;mogroside V&quot; and is often mixed with erythritol) chemically similar to artificial sweeteners and do they carry the same health risks?

I have been using monk fruit for almost two years - and recently found my blood sugar levels are too high (despite being slender and extremely fit).  Could Monk fruit be the cause?

Text: A little explanation for people not aware of these animals;

The Fuegian dog was a domesticated species of &quot;dog&quot; bred from the South American culpeo fox. The culpeo isn't a true fox, more closely related to wolves and jackals, but the Fuegian dog was not descended from wolf ancestors like the domestic dog is. They were bred as hunting dogs by the Yahgan people, but showed none of the loyalty that wolf-descended dogs show to their owners, and were ultimately all exterminated because they were aggressive and had grown dangerous to humans and cattle.

The radium fox was a specific color morph of the red fox bred on a fur farm from two silver fox parents. The coat was like a reverse of the silver fox's-- white with a black undercoat, rather than black with a white undercoat. Very few of them existed and they proved difficult to breed consistently, so the morph was &quot;retired&quot; in favor of similar, more easily-bred colors that are common today, and so naturally died out when humans stopped trying to breed them. There's woefully little in-depth info about these foxes, so I'm not sure we know what genes were responsible for the specific colors, but the fact that the first litter of them came from two otherwise normal silver fox parents makes me think this one can still theoretically be bred back to life.

My question is, would a concentrated effort be able to restore these two animals, or would we only be able to reach very close approximations? Is this due to the lack of information about them, or the way genetics and evolution work?

Text: The mirror test, as I understand it, is as simple as putting a dot or a mark on an animal's forehead or other part visible in the mirror, then showing the animal their reflection to see if they interact with the mark in any way. My question is, why would we expect an animal to interact with a mark that either 1) they might just think the mark was always there, or 2) the mark wasn't bothering them before so why bother with it now? Sure, some animals might care, but I'd say cats or dogs probably wouldn't give a darn about the dot, even if they did recognize themselves in the mirror. How is the mirror test actually telling us anything about if animals recognize their reflections or not? I would think it's very assumptious to say that animals who haven't passed this test cannot identify themselves in a mirror, but am I somehow wrong?

Text: Let's say that someone has a perfectly healthy hearing. Guidelines will say that it's safe for him to listen to music with headphones up to a specified volume.

Now let's say this person incurred hearing loss. Let's say that we use some software to raise the volume of the music they're listening on a frequency-specific and hear-specific manner, so that their perceived loudness of the music is the same as before hearing loss occured. This person turns up their music to safe volume, and then the software raises volume.

Would this person hearing be as safe from noise-induced hearing loss as if he had no volume-raising software and no hearing damage? Or would they risk just as much damage as someone with no hearing loss whatsoever?

Text: Does having a deficient sense, such as poor vision without corrective lenses, or lower quality hearing, whether from hearing loss or tinnitus, without hearing aids, impact the person’s ability to think clearly and process information?

For example: yes, having impaired vision would impact someone’s ability to process visual information, like physical perception or reading, but does whatever additional cognitive effort given to overcoming the impaired vision take away from cognitive ability of other tasks, like critical thinking, problem solving, mood stability, social skills, etc? And if so, would those deficiency even out once, in this example, corrective lenses are used?

Text: Playing some kids’ geometric puzzle pieces (and then doing some pencil &amp; paper checks), I realized something.

It started like this: I can line up a sequence of pentagons and equilateral triangles, end-to-end, and get a cycle (a segmented circle). There are 30 shapes in this cycle (15 pentagon-triangle pairs), and so the perimeter of the cycle is divided then into 30 equal straight segments.

[Here is a figure to show what i'm talking about] (https://imgur.com/NfXtoDK)

You can do something similar with squares and triangles and you get a smaller cycle: 6 square-pentagon pairs, dividing the perimeter into 12 segments.

And then you can just build it with triangles - basically you just get a hexagon with six sides.

For regular polygons beyond the pentagon, it changes. Hexagons and triangles gets you a straight line (actually, you *can* get a cycle out of these, but it isn't of segments like all the others). Then, you get cycles bending in the opposite direction with 8-, 9-, 12-, 15-, and 24-gons. For those, respectively, the perimeter (now the ‘inner’ boundary of the pattern - see the figure above for an example) is divided into 24, 18, 12, 10, and 8 segments.

You can also make cycles with some polygons on their own: triangles, squares, hexagons (three hexagons in sequence make a cycle), and you can do it a couple of ways with octagons (with four or eight). You can also make cycles with some other combinations (e.g. 10(*edited from 5*) pentagon-square pairs).

Here’s what I realized:
The least common multiple of those numbers (the number of segments to the perimeter of the triangle-polygon circle) is *360*! (at least, I’m pretty sure of it.. maybe here I have made a mistake).

This means that if you lay all those cycles on a common circle, and if you want to subdivide the circle in such a way as to catch the edges of every segment, you need 360 subdivisions.

Am I just doing some kind of circular-reasoning numerology here or is this maybe a part of the long-lost rationale for the division of the circle into 360 degrees? The wikipedia article claims it’s not known for certain but seems weighted for a “it’s close to the # of days in the year” explanation, and also nods to the fact that 360 is such a *convenient* number (can be divided lots and lots of ways - which seems related to what I noticed). Surely I am not the first discoverer of this pattern.. in fact this seems like something that would have been easy for an ancient Mesopotamian to discover..

*
*
*edit for tldr*
*
*

For those who don't understand the explanation above (i sympathize): to be clear, this method gets you exactly 360 subdivisions of a circle *but it has nothing to do with choice of units*. *It's a coincidence*, not a tautology, as some people are suggesting.. I thought it was an interesting coincidence because the method relies on constructing circles (or cycles) out of elementary geometrical objects (regular polyhedra).


The most common response below is basically what wikipedia says (i.e. common knowledge); 360 is a highly composite number, divisible by the Babylonian 60, and is close to the number of days in the year, so that probably is why the number was originally chosen. But I already recognized these points in my original post.. what I want to know is whether or not this **coincidence** has been noted before or proposed as a possible method for how the B's came up with &quot;360&quot;, *even if it's probably not true*.

Thanks!

Text: I've been having this discussion with a friend, and realized that I needed to do more investigation. I referenced a 60 Minutes episode (from a few years ago) where a scientist was able to determine if somebody was white or black just by looking at accelerometer data from when they would jump on and off of a sensor. This was independent of age, sex, or body size, implying some underlying difference in musculature and nerve reaction.

My friend countered with [this article](https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/health-general-science/are-you-there-race-its-me-dna), which calls into question whether or not race is a relevant term, and which points out that genetic diversity between we humans is really quite small. There was also [this interesting discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/10m8st/from_a_genetic_perspective_are_human_races/) along similar lines here on Reddit several years ago.

For the sake of this, let's ignore DNA testing, which I understand to be quite accurate for determining heritage. I'm also not fully convinced that arguments regarding the similarity or dis-similarity of the genetic code in a population is actually relevant. Even a tiny mutation can lead to [dramatic differences](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/gk-and-current-affairs/story/genetic-disorders-263627-2015-09-18) in structure.

So, rephrasing the question... can examination of the skeleton and/or internal organs provide sufficient information to determine whether someone is primarily from one population or another?

Text: I thought that if the molecule is polar, then the bonds will be polar as well, and if the molecule is nonpolar, then the bonds will be nonpolar. But ozone is a polar molecule made of nonpolar covalent bonds, and carbon dioxide is a nonpolar molecule with polar bonds. So, is there a way to know the type of bond just by knowing the dipole moment?

Text: It's a bit of a silly question, but I can't get it off my mind.

I'm putting up some Static cling window films for winter because it reduces heat loss through the glass. The dimensions are roughly about 50x38 inches.

Since I'm not covering the entire window I started wondering which part of it would be where the largest portion of the heat escapes through the window's surface. My intuition tells me it is the upper half, but I'm also not sure if there would be any appreciable difference at that scale. The way modern double-glazed windows are structured to help prevent heat loss also makes me more uncertain if it would work quite that way.

How does the location and amount of water in Earth's water bodies change over time, particularly in a warming climate? The upcoming [SWOT](https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/overview/) (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) mission plans to find out.

The SUV-size satellite will measure the height of Earth's salt and fresh water around the world, [track regional shifts in sea level](https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/news/66/international-satellite-to-track-impacts-of-small-ocean-currents/) at scales never seen before, and make NASA's first truly [global survey of the planet's fresh water](https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/news/68/us-european-satellite-will-make-worlds-first-global-freshwater-survey/).

By tracking water around the world, SWOT will help us manage water resources and make decisions in communities affected by sea level rise and climate change.

SWOT is scheduled for launch in December. It is a collaboration between NASA and the French space agency Centre National d'Études Spatiales (CNES), with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency and the UK Space Agency.

We are:

+ **Eva Peral (EP)**, Systems Engineer, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
+ **Margaret Srinivasan (MS)**, SWOT Applications Lead, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
+ **Cedric David (CD)**, Hydrologist, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
+ **Ben Hamlington (BH)**, Oceanographer, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory

Ask us anything, including:

+ How SWOT can help communities manage water resources
+ What SWOT can tell us about the ocean's role in climate change
+ The engineering behind SWOT's main instrument, the Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn)
+ How SWOT will monitor fresh water sources like lakes, rivers, and reservoirs

Proof: https://twitter.com/NASAEarth/status/1589678573056626696

Text: As far as I remember, the oxygen we breathe in becomes the final electron acceptor on the electron transport chain during cell respiration, and is released as water due to the electrons it accepts or something like that. I thought the CO2 came from the pyruvate decarboxylation step immediately after glycolysis. Doesn’t this mean that the CO2 we breathe out is converted from what we eat, not what we breathe?

Text: I've noticed lately that when I walk through the city, I can often see four species of corvids at the same time- magpies, hooded crows, rooks and jackdaws, often just within few dozen meters from each other.

There is a lot of bird species around, but they usually have their own things - some keep to water, some to parks or some wild areas, they have different beaks, diets etc. I would guess pigeons are wildly successful because they eat anything and reproduce a lot. They did push out sparrows out of the city in the last 20-30 years (though I understand there were other factors as well, like pollution).

But those city corvids have very similar diets, they're all very intelligent- how do they occupy the same space without one species dominating their niche and pushing others away? Why isn't the biggest one, or the smartest one, or the most cooperative winning? Or maybe they are more different than I think?

Text: I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the Harvard/Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. I use a mix of telescope observations, stellar evolution models, and Milky Way surveys to study binary stars -- that is, pairs of stars that are orbiting each other and (in most cases) formed from the same gas cloud. My collaborators and I recently published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06833) reporting the discovery of a binary containing a dormant black hole and a Sun-like star, orbiting each other at roughly the same distance as the Earth and the Sun. The black hole is about 10 times the mass of the Sun, so its event horizon is about 30 km. At a distance of about 1600 light years from Earth, it's about 3 times closer than the next-closest known black hole.

The black hole is fairly different from other stellar-mass black holes we know about, which are almost all bright X-ray and radio sources. They're bright because they're feeding on a companion star, and gas from the star forms a disk around the black hole where it gets heated to millions of degrees. That's how we discover those black holes in the first place. But in this one -- which we named Gaia BH1 -- the companion star is far enough away that the black hole isn't getting anything to eat, and so it's not bright in X-rays or radio. The only reason we know it's there at all is that we can see the effects of its gravity on the Sun-like star, which is orbiting an invisible object at a 100 km/s clip.

[Here's](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/05/science/astronomy-black-hole.html) a NYT article with more info about the discovery, and [here's](https://www.mpia.de/news/science/2022-16-gaia-bh1) a press release that goes into somewhat more detail.

AMA about this discovery, black holes, stars, astronomy, or anything else! I'll start answering questions at 1:30 PM Eastern (1830 UT), AMA!

Hello,

In the thought experiment about Schrödinger's Cat, why is it that we are allowed to assume that the cat is both dead and alive? How come we just don't say 'We don't know whether it's alive or dead until we look; so we're not going to make any assumptions until then,'? This is the part of that thought experiment I don't understand; nothing I've searched explains exactly how we are meant to think of the cat in both states.

There have apparently been a handful of second generation hybrids though, like the Liliger from a lion and a Ligress, or the Litigon from a Tigoness and a lion. I can't find anywhere if these 3-quarter of a lion are fertile. Since there has been only a small number of these animals maybe none of them happened to bear or sir offsprings (plus these hybridations are seen as unethical in the first place), but could we know theoretically?

Text: I was talking with my wife about the ulnaris and radialis nerves and which fingers they control. As I understood, each nerve is responsible for the movement of more than one finger. Since these fingers can move (mostly) independently, we asked ourselves how the signal to move a specific finger is encoded or transported to the specific finger.

Is each nerve like a bundle of smaller nerves and each &quot;fiber&quot; only transmits the signal towards its specific receiver? Or is the signal somehow encoded and all signals travel through the same nerve and are somehow decoded at the correct recipient? Or are we totally wrong about how nerves function in general (I have heard about synapses, neurons and neurotransmitters but do not understand the &quot;macroscopic&quot; function of nerves.

In short: How can one nerve control several independently moveable fingers.

Thank you!

Text: The way I understand it, the SRY gene is found on the Y chromosome, and it encodes for TDF. This, in turn, leads to prenatal testosterone and AMH. The prenatal testosterone lead to the development of the male reproductive system from the Wolffian duct while AMH leads to the disintegration of the Mullerian duct. Conversely, if there is no Y chromosome and no upsurge of testosterone or presence of AMH, the Wolffian duct disintegrates while the Mullerian duct develops into the female reproductive tract.

In that case, it seems like people with XO genotypes have no Y chromosome = no TDF = no AMH/high levels of T, so they should develop ovaries. What am I missing?

Text: like obviously you’re going to be intubated because you have some kind of respiratory distress, but if the patient can breathe, can they do so when they’re intubated? i know they can’t speak, but breathing through the nose seems possible. hope that makes sense!

Text: Lots of diseases like cancer arise spontaneously, and I'm not sure you can specifically breed certain animals to be susceptible to very specific genetic mutations. So when they need to test treatments for specific rare diseases like that how do they do it?

Are there facilities that raise thousands of primates and pray that some of them develop triple-negative breast cancer (or whatever specific disease you're testing treatments for)?

I imagine this is especially important when you're designing drugs like monoclonal antibodies that target specific factors and are increasingly designed for more and more specific diseases

Title: Sonnet 1
Type: poem
Text: From fairest creatures we desire increase,
 That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
 But as the riper should by time decease,
 His tender heir might bear his memory:
 But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
 Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
 Making a famine where abundance lies,
 Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
 Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
 And only herald to the gaudy spring,
 Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
 And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
 Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
 To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
