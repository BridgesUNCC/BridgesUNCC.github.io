Title: Are there any naturally occuring materials that were common in Earth's history (or predicted to have existed) that are extremely rare or &quot;extinct&quot; today?

Text: A quick note on what I mean by &quot;materials&quot; in this context: this could be chemical compounds, certain elements, ores, types of stone, as well as specific or notable variants of those, etc. - not technicalities like extinct animals or flora. An exception might be if the notable material *came from* said flora/fauna, like an interesting type of amber formed from a notably different kind of sap or other evolutionary mechanism.

Text: I started a new batch of mead relying on the yeast naturally occurring in raw honey. At this stage I'm regularly stirring the batch to introduce oxygen for yeast growth. Using an electric whisk to oxygenate creates a lot of bubbles, nearly a foam, on the top. I'm wondering how this impacts the exange of oxygen to yeast in the mixture? What passes along the 'skin' of a bubble? Is it a static structure until it pops or do sugar and water molecules flow along the surface? And if those things do flow, do yeast cells travel along the surface? 

Side notes for those interested. After the yeast peaks in activity it will move to an air locked environment to encourage alcohol production and give time for the yeast to break down the fructose, which takes longer. The source of my knowledge is coming from The Art of Fermentation by Sandor Ellix Katz. This isn't the first time following this method and harmful contamination risks are pretty low and very detectable.

This is also a small, hobby amount and the question is really a curiosity about the structure of bubbles. Don't really care about making perfect mead or I'd post this question elsewhere.

Text: When we were hunter gatherers I mean.

I know there are click languages in Africa which are spoken by hunter gatherers but I can only assume those languages have changed a large amount over the years.

Do lingustics have any idea what a primitive human language would sound like?

Like, maybe favouring certain constants like ejectives that could carry over very long distances while hunting? Maybe lots of tones so they could whistle it instead in open plains or high mountainous areas?

Text: 
What’s happening on a molecular level? I don’t do well with abstract thought so I’ll provide an “experiment” and hopefully someone clever can explain it to me.

Say I have two dry kidney beans. I put one on a sunny windowsill on a hot day and I put the other one in the freezer. An hour later, I take both beans and put them side by side on a plate on the kitchen table. After some time, they both return to room temperature. 

My questions are numbered but you don’t have to answer them directly like this, it just makes it easier for me:

1. If I put the beans under a super strong microscope that could show me the molecules (or whatever level we’d have to be observing to see what we want to see) while they were still hot/cold, how could I recognize by observation alone which one was hot and which one was cold?

2. What would the molecules in each bean do as it cooled/warmed up, respectively?

3. If the beans on the plate existed in a small vacuum universe, just big enough for the beans and a few cubic inches of air around them, how would their respective temperatures effect each other or the air as their temperature equalized? Would you be able to see the air around the hot bean heat up as the hot bean itself cools down, and what would that look like?

4. What causes temperature to equalize (why do hot things cool down, why do cold things warm up?)

High school was a long time ago and I never took physics anyway. So feel free to keep it simple lol

Text: I started a new batch of mead relying on the yeast naturally occurring in raw honey. At this stage I'm regularly stirring the batch to introduce oxygen for yeast growth. Using an electric whisk to oxygenate creates a lot of bubbles, nearly a foam, on the top. I'm wondering how this impacts the exange of oxygen to yeast in the mixture? What passes along the 'skin' of a bubble? Is it a static structure until it pops or do sugar and water molecules flow along the surface? And if those things do flow, do yeast cells travel along the surface? 

Side notes for those interested. After the yeast peaks in activity it will move to an air locked environment to encourage alcohol production and give time for the yeast to break down the fructose, which takes longer. The source of my knowledge is coming from The Art of Fermentation by Sandor Ellix Katz. This isn't the first time following this method and harmful contamination risks are pretty low and very detectable.

This is also a small, hobby amount and the question is really a curiosity about the structure of bubbles. Don't really care about making perfect mead or I'd post this question elsewhere.

Does whatever type of curl pattern the parents have determine the type of curl pattern their child has?

So sorry because this might be an obvious answer but I do not come from a science background. TIA.

A+B? 
B-A?
A?
B?
Something else? 

To add a practical example. I can only read a sign from 5m away when staring directly at it, any further away and I can’t read it. If that sign is placed 6m from a mirror (B) and I look at the mirror from 2m away (A), would I be able to read the sign? 

Additionally, if the sign is placed 2m from the mirror (B) and I stand behind it so I am 5m from the mirror (A), could I still read the sign? 

Assuming it’s a flat mirror and I’m not obstructing the view to the object/ sign.

I wondered if it has Milankovich cycles that could at least cool it down a bit.

Text: Hi everyone! We are the producers of the documentary miniseries [*Spy in the Ocean*](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/collections/spy-in-the-ocean/). For this installment we created more than 30 realistic animatronic spy creatures to explore the seas and capture never-before-seen animal behavior. The Spies we created include a whale calf (our biggest yet!), shark, dolphin, manatee, cuttlefish, octopus, seal, crab and many more. Utilizing the latest subsea technology, these robot lookalikes ventured to the depths of the ocean floor to interact with their animal counterparts, communicating with them and mimicking their patterns. We're happy to answer your questions about how these robots work, what we discovered, and more!

*Spy in the Ocean* is currently airing on PBS on Wednesdays at 8/7c (check local listings). You can watch the first two episodes now at [pbs.org](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/collections/spy-in-the-ocean/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvxs_j5q540bdPfHEZXOD6O5C1NntHdid), or on the [PBS App](https://www.pbs.org/pbs-app/).

If you're in the UK, you can watch the whole series on the [BBC iPlayer](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m001mp1b/spy-in-the-ocean).

Answering questions at **11 am ET / 4 pm UK** will be:

+ **Matthew Gordon**, series producer. Matthew has been working in the wildlife film industry for over 20 years. Before entering the film industry, Matthew received a BSc degree in Biology and an MSc in Palaeobiology from the University of Bristol. He specialized in human evolution and primatology and worked in various environments from the rainforests of Madagascar to the deserts of Arizona. He then started his career at John Downer Productions in the edit suite, cutting sequences for BBC/Discovery programs like *Tiger - Spy in the Jungle* and *Swarm*. For the first two series of *Spy in the Wild*, he spent 6 years working across the world from filming orangutans in the jungles of Borneo to sea otters in Alaska. For *Spy in the Ocean*, Matthew fulfilled a lifelong dream to film humpback whales in French Polynesia and a 'megapod' of spinner dolphins in Costa Rica.
+ **Huw Williams**, series producer. Huw studied at Aberystwyth University where he got his BSc in Zoology before joining John Downer Productions in 2009, when he first started working on *Earthflight/Winged Planet* and *Polar Bear Spy on the Ice*. From filming wolves in the Artic to sea snakes in the ocean depths of Indonesia, Huw has been fortunate to gain many experiences while filming wildlife around the world. *Spy in the Ocean* highlights for Huw include diving with giant shoals of hammerhead sharks, working on getting the spy hammerhead into the heart of the shoal, and filming the spy cuttlefish as it communicated with an amorous cuttlefish looking for a mate.
+ **Philip Dalton**, executive producer. Philip has a BSc degree in Environmental Biology and his wildlife filmmaking career spans over 25 years. He started out at the BBC Natural History Unit before moving onto IMAX productions, eventually landing with John Downer Productions. His programs have collected numerous awards from the Royal Television Society, Wildscreen and more, along with an EMMY for Best Cinematography for *Winged Planet*. Philip is instrumental in developing and operating the specialist camera devices used on the *Spy* films, shooting main camera for some of its most memorable sequences.

Text: So there's a train of thought here and I'm sorry if I ramble, but I'm not sure how to actually explain what I want to know very well or I'd just Google it myself.

So I've been watching deep sea documentary videos. And they say Challenger Deep is 12000 meters down and almost freezing. But the furthest down we've been able to drill is 11000 meters, and as far as I understand it, the heat was the biggest obstacle preventing going further. Plus unless I'm just misunderstanding everything, shouldn't higher pressures increase temperature? 

So how is the deepest depths not hotter than a couple degrees? My first thought was the hot water would rise and cooler water would come down to take it's place, but that would cause like constant sideways tornadoes of water. So I searched if vertical currents were a thing. I found upwellings and downwellings. But most of what I could find was related to shallower water nearer the coast. 

So yeah, I'm probably missing and misunderstanding alot, but this has been in my head for like a week. Appreciate any answers!

If it's 'full spectrum' and by it's nature, white is a combination of all colors, isn't that the same spectrum as sunlight? So what' in the white light of the lamp is missing then? Is it a 'richer' light? What does that even mean? Isn't light light?

Text: There is a general consensus that agriculture started in Fertile Crescent around 12 thousand years ago, later independently in other regions around &quot;middle latitudes&quot; such as China and Mesoamerica. People usually focus on the timing but my question is why it started roughly in middle latitudes? 

Today most fertile lands (mollisols) are located in Canada and Eurasian prairies but as far as we know, these are not where Neolithic Revolution first took place. Was there more important factors for progenitors of first domesticated plants, such as growing season suitability, population density, paleolithic tools etc., or when Holocene started, these middle latitude regions had mollisols already but later lost their fertility? 

I assume complex interplay of different factors are offered by different scholars without a consensus but any answer or suggestion for academic publication is welcome.

To my understanding, the stigma against monosodium glutamate arose from a letter, possibly intended as a joke, published by Science magazine in the sixties, which claimed that Chinese food was a cause of migraines. The idea went viral and the nocebo effect did the rest. 

To this day, despite being present in much of the food we consume, many people will swear blind that MSG causes them a variety of symptoms, such as rapid heart rate and sweating.

If I draw blood from either the living person or the recently deceased and give it to the scientist, will he be able to tell where the blood came from based on the &quot;freshness&quot;?

Text: Hi Reddit! This is Tiffany from Bloomberg and I am joined by Dr. Philippe Grandjean of Southern Denmark University here. In a new documentary, I interviewed Dr. Grandjean on how substances known as PFAS, or &quot;forever chemicals,&quot; found their way to every corner of the planet-and the consequences.

You can watch it here: https://youtu.be/t8qGtEVh7oQ?si=QNjv4-IorQrCtpL4

PFAS are used in hundreds of everyday products-from fabric protectors, electronics and non-stick pans to foams, tapes and even toilet paper. PFAS are called &quot;forever chemicals&quot; because the properties that make them so useful to consumers make them very persistent in the environment.

In the Bloomberg Originals video documentary The Poison In Us All, we reveal how the chemicals - which have been linked to cancer and are the subject of sweeping litigation - ended up inside the bodies of almost everyone on the planet.

Litigation has revealed documents showing that its manufacturers, including industrial giant 3M, had dumped the chemicals for years and have been aware of the dangers associated with PFAS. 3M has said its products &quot;are safe and effective for their intended uses&quot; and assailed plaintiffs' lawyers for selectively citing documents to portray &quot;an incomplete and misleading story about 3M's actions.&quot;

We'll be on at **1pm ET (18 UT)**, ask me and Dr. Grandjean any questions you have about PFAS here!

Text: Hello I'm looking to settle an argument I've recently had with my buddies (who are all engineers) about the physics of a hypothetical race car in different gravitational environments. My hypothesis is that a car with all other factors the same including air density on a level plane will accelerate faster in slightly higher G environments than in slightly lower G environments. This hypothesis assumes that traction is a limiting factor of acceleration for this vehicle.

My reason for this hypothesis is that in higher G environments weight and therefore traction would increase but mass would remain unchanged. This would prevent the vehicle from spinning it's wheels off the line resulting in faster acceleration times than a lower G vehicle and since mass is unchanged it would have negligible impact on horizontal acceleration. They argue that since the vehicle would have more weight (not mass) it would be substantially slower. 

Could anybody help us out here? I'm sure I'm right and they're sure I'm stupid. An equation or links to other resources would be greatly appreciated!

Text: Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for 'X' were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;.

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

Text: I wonder that since neutron star is such massive object that time is moving slower in neutron stars compare to us. The result that on our reference frame their particles are move slower on average on our perspective resulting a cooler than it really appears? compound with red shift caused by massive amount gravity light has to fight against when  leaving the star causing more red shifted appearance.

Do scientists account for these effect when they report their temperature and luminosity? Is the temperature listed on wiki their apparent temperature of their actual temperature?   

Also does neutron star get redder/dimmer as they get more heaver with more powerful time dilation effects?

Usually it's a pretty clear path between the Sahara and the Amazon rainforest, and I've always enjoyed watching large particulates traverse across our globe to feed this fascinating oxygenation cycle. 

But I've noticed this year when I go to watch this wonder occurring, the particulates are being diverted by the storms in the atlantic, and being drawn northwards, instead of over the Amazon rainforest. 

Are they being sunk into the ocean? What happens if the cycle is disrupted for too long?

Text: (If this isn't the right place to ask this question, please let me know. I know this is kind of a specific question for a broad subreddit, but I thought the sheer size of the community might mean a better chance of it being answered.)  
Pretty much what it says on the tin: Is it possible for a reindeer to never grow antlers in its life? If so, why?  
Like, are there any genetic illnesses that might hinder antler growth? Any diseases they can catch that might attack the systems that make antlers grow or something? I'd expect any hypothetical lack of antlers to be due to Something Going Wrong because they seem pretty important, but is it at all possible for it to just be a rare genetic quirk or something?  
How badly might any of these hypothetical causes affect the animal? Could it live a mostly-normal life? Would it be sickly and weak? Would it just die in infancy or the womb? Something else?  
I'd just consult Google about this, but everything Google gives me is about how they shed their antlers every year. Which I already knew.  
Thank you in advance.

Text: After looking it up, I found out it is estimated that we do not have the remains of most, probably 99%, of the animals that existed a very long time ago in the past/prehistory, because fossilization is rare, meaning most animals do not fossilize but instead rot away or are destroyed by natural phenomena or disappear another way. On top of this, we have not dug very deep into most areas of the Earth, so we likely do not even have the remains of most animals which did fossilize.

But is there any way we could possibly figure out or guess how such creatures looked? Such as maybe by knowing what traits they needed to survive in the environments that existed during the times they lived or by potential parallels they could have had with other creatures that lived during the times when they were alive or any other way?

Text: Demand for protein - especially meat, which takes by far the biggest toll on the environment - is soaring as the population grows, tastes change, and incomes fluctuate. As people around the world gather together for food-rich holidays, we wonder: **Can we feed this growing world without starving the planet?**

One possible solution is something you've probably seen in the news and around your social feeds recently: [cell-cultivated (aka 'lab-grown) chicken](https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/the-protein-problem/lab-grown-cultivated-meat/index.html), beef or even seafood. Do you think it could be part of future sustainable Thanksgiving meals?

Meat cultivated from cells - that doesn't require raising and killing animals - is starting to show up in a few restaurants in Singapore and the U.S. A recent poll from [The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research](https://apnews.com/article/can-meatless-mondays-help-environment-b09eaab6cbdce176debff415b48b1ec0) found that half of adults in the meat-hungry U.S. would be unlikely to try it. A majority of those who said they wouldn't said &quot;it just sounds weird.&quot; As part of a new series from AP, I explored whether cultivated meat, which some people call 'lab-grown' meat, could ever displace animal agriculture. And, as a vegetarian myself, I looked at what it would take to tempt consumers to try it.

Join [me](https://apnews.com/author/laura-ungar) (Laura Ungar), journalist [JoNel Aleccia](https://apnews.com/article/labgrown-chicken-cultivated-meat-863e7d68c8c4a5293683a7c5d6a58d15) - who covered the FDA approval for sales of cell-cultivated chicken in the U.S.- and [Claire Bomkamp](https://gfi.org/team/claire-bomkamp-ph-d/) - who is a lead scientist focused on cultivated meat and seafood at The Good Food Institute - at **2pm ET (19 UT)** for a conversation about the future of meat without animals.

Text: So im taking QM and learning about the pauli exclusion principle. Upon further digging, it seems that the reason two electrons can't be in the same position and state at the same time is because they(and all other particles of their class) are anti-symmetric. Meaning their wave functions are subtracted. Meaning the total wave function is zero.

Ok, but where does this come from?! lmao

The answers I found said its just taken as a theoretical definition. As in, its just assumed to be true in order for the equations to work. But is there some genuine deeper truth in quantum field theory, or is this just another one of those things we simply have no idea about? Like the origin of electron spin?

Or has COVID19 just been studied far more rigorously as a brand new disease with global impact? I'm wondering if there are similar less acute impacts to being infected with influenza, etc. that we just don't really recognize.

Text: When hydrogen peroxide reacts with a wound, catalase present in bacteria and the wound itself reacts with the hydrogen peroxide to produce oxygen and water, which fizzes and eventually completes the chemical reaction and ends the burning. Does alcohol go through any sort of a similar process that eventually leads to it becoming &quot;inert&quot;? What exactly is happening to cause the burning sensation of alcohol?

Considering the elevation, it's no doubt many millions of years ago. I'm wondering if anyone knows what I'm talking about, since I can't really get a good photo yet, and if there's any geologic research in the dead sea?

I know the core's energy is mostly inacessible to humans, but the question does not ask whether it's acessible or not? I don't know if I'm missing something. Thanks.

Text: My understanding of the birth of the universe is mostly simple. The earliest universe was swirling mass of hydrogen and helium, and eventually those gases got close enough and heavy enough and compressed enough to make stars. And those stars made new stuff. And sometimes the stars exploded and that made entirely different stuff. This is a process that has been going on for a long while. 

Are today's stars only making the same elements that the universe already has? Or do we think that there are stars today also forging entirely new, different elements that we've never seen before?

I was wondering if animals instinctively know what habitat they belong to and if they might feel stressed because of that. Think of zebras and antelopes, for example. They didn't evolve in the temperate zones, yet now they get plenty of rain, cold weather, leaves everywhere, and totally different sounds and smells. 

Would the same species behave differently if they lived in a zoo in their own climate zone?

I’m having trouble finding research on this. I want to know the difference between rivers that are tectonically active vs. that are not. It seems as though tectonics would have a significant impact on the entire river, but I don’t know how much that would specifically effect it downstream.

Text: Something doesn't add up when I look at the night sky. They say the moon and the sun appears the same size in the sky, because the sun is 400x further away from us, but also 400x bigger. That makes sense to me. The diameter our eyes see on the sky is the same for the moon and the sun (which is why we can have total solar eclipses)

The nearest star to us is 268770 astronomical units away, which means it is 268770x further away from us than the sun. Other stars are even further away. But I can still see them. To me, they seem like dots in the sky. When I compare them to the size of the moon in the sky, they seem to be roughly 100 times smaller in my field of view. It's like taking a grain of sand and putting it next to a coin. Sure, it is much smaller, but certainly doesn't seem 268770x smaller at all. 

How can we even see a sun-sized star that is 268770x further away from us? Even as a dot in our field of view, that seems like WAY too big relative to the sun/moon's size (maybe 100x smaller only). So to me, this doesn't make sense. I failed to find an answer to this on google. Can anyone explain how?

Text: I've seen many videos of rivers getting blocked by a strip of sand right where it's about to enter the ocean. (such as [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psi62O-NHRQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psi62O-NHRQ))

I can't comprehend how this possibly happens. If the river flows continuously, shouldn't it be able to easily cut a path through this thin strip of sand? Even if it doesn't, shouldn't there still be a dry river channel to the ocean? How did the sand get there?

(Edit: Apparently this happens to some inlets too)

Text: Lions, obviously, come from the savannah, so they adapted to live in the heat, and not so much the cold. I know lions are quite comfortable during the winter in zoos, even in places that get super cold, but I have to imageine that's at least partially due to the zookeepers taking care of them. Heated rocks to lie on, heated indoor enclosures to go into if needed, abundant food and no need to hunt, etc.

But what if a bunch of lions from the zoo were to escape into the wild in an area that had below-freezing winters (and they didn't get any additional help from humans). Could they survive the winter?

And if yes, what's the coldest winter they could likely survive all on their own? Like imagine if humans just all up and vanished and the zoo lions got out. Could they survive the winter if they were in an area that saw winters getting down to 10 dehrees fahrenheit? 0 fahrenheit? -10? -20? What's the coldest they could realistically survive all on their own?

Text: Hello everyone. I was thinking about that question for some time and I think that it keeps traveling but I can be wrong. Let me explain what I mean: lets suppost that in a cold day you put the heater on and you open the window. The heat escapes through the window. The temp outside is 32°F / 0°C and inside is 80°F / 26°C. If you measure the air temperature (assuming that the winds are calm) outside close to the window, the temp is about 50°F / 10°C. As you go further and further, the temperature approaches 32F/0C. But, in a microscopic level, I was thinking if that heat keeps &quot;alive&quot; and &quot;travels&quot;, then in a really miniscule difference, say for example 32.0006°F / 0.0003°C (assuming that outside is exactly 32.0000000 / 0.0000000°C). Or does heat completely dies and therefore don't travel? Please, explain. Thank you.

Text: Hi Reddit! We are a group of scientists whose work entails weighing the world's climate pledges. Our aim is to not only understand whether the country-by-country climate commitments are sufficient to meet the world's warming goals, but to also assess the potential pathways we can take to realize those goals. By using one of the key models utilized by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we seek to understand what socioeconomic consequences could flow from the pathways on offer. With COP28 and the Global Stocktake starting in just two days, we wanted to answer any questions you have on the meeting and the global project of slowing climate change.

We hail mostly from the Joint Global Change Research Institute ([JGCRI](https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/jgcri)), a partnership institute between the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory ([PNNL](https://www.pnnl.gov/news)) and the University of Maryland (UMD). We are [Gokul Iyer (PNNL)](https://www.pnnl.gov/people/gokul-iyer), [Haewon McJeon (KAIST Graduate School of Green Growth)](https://kaist-iam.github.io/group/), [Yang Ou (Peking University)](http://scholar.pku.edu.cn/yangou/english), and [Yiyun 'Ryna' Cui (UMD)](https://cgs.umd.edu/our-community/faculty-staff/yiyun-ryna-cui).

In past work, we've shown that the world's climate pledges may be [enough to avoid the worst of global warming](https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/new-climate-pledges-if-fulfilled-now-significantly-more-likely-prevent-worst-global). Yet we are still [**not** on track for a 1.5-degree world](https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/world-will-probably-warm-beyond-15-degree-limit-peak-warming-can-be-curbed). Our most recent work points to [three major efforts](https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/how-slow-global-warming-three-widescale-efforts-could-make-difference) that could get us back there. How much carbon dioxide must we remove from Earth's atmosphere to meet our goals, and by when? What about greenhouse gasses other than carbon dioxide? Will planting trees really help? Should I stop eating beef? All fair questions, which we're happy to answer from **1-3pm PST (4-6 PM EST, 21:00 UTC)** today!

Text: I'm a junior chemistry major but I still haven't really had this explained.

The curve in an absorbance spectra, as opposed a straight line at an exact frequency, can be explained by the doppler effect. If light is absorbed in an orbital at X frequency and you shoot light with a frequency of 0.95 X at the orbital, if the molecule is moving towards the light source at a certain speed, the doppler effect will increase the effective frequency to X from the perspective. Works similarly if you shoot light with a frequency of 1.05 X and the molecule is moving away.

There's uncertainty in every measurement. When you measure a liter of water, you can say a liter, or be more precise, say 1.0 liters, and then 1.02 liters, 1.018 liters, etc. You can always get more and more precise. How do we deal with precision in the energy difference between electron configurations? The frequency of light needed to excite an electron configuration from the ground state to an excited state is in a molecule is often given in eV. If there's a difference of 3.21 eV between two configurations, and the light hitting the orbital has an energy of 3.21 eV, the orbital will absorb the energy and become excited. What if the difference between the configurations was really 3.214 eV, and it was hit by light with an energy of 3.213 eV? Would it still be absorbed? When is the difference too much?

Is it more of a &quot;We'll enter at xx angle, at yyy speed, at between 500-600k miles before exiting on xxx heading&quot;, or is it much more accurate than that?

I get that trajectories, and orbital dynamics etc are worked out with incredible precision, but in reality what's the margin of error?

Surely our measurements of the planets' mass can't be that accurate, not to mention the effects of nearby moons etc. 

Even if they are that accurate, how much difference would it make if the probe was say, a few hundred miles closer to jupiter?

Text: Some background and then details on my specific case:

When people record live music, there's typically a few things they carry in their kit: 1) a microphone (in some cases a pair of electret mics), 2) a &quot;battery box&quot; which provides power to the mics and passes the signal through to a 3) recording device.  Most recording devices also have their own &quot;mic level&quot; power, but &quot;tapers&quot; highly recommend using a battery box and turning off the power from the recorder if possible.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are: what does a battery box do and is it really important in my setup described below?  Is there anything I can do to improve my design, like using different resistors - i.e., would 3-6K resistors (or even lower) be better?

In my case, I'm making my own &quot;battery box&quot; using info available online.  It basically has [this](https://i.imgur.com/SUswVO6.jpg) layout.  I am using a 12v (21/23) battery and 9.1K resistors, along with capacitors of sizes ranging from 22pF to 1uF (I've built several on the premise that the 22pF caps help provide bass roll-off, while the 1uF do not).  I kinda understand the purpose of the caps (at least in theory), but it's the resistors that I'm confused about, and ultimately how important the battery box is in this setup.

When measuring the inherent &quot;mic level&quot; output of my recorder (a Roland R-07), I see 2v and what looks like \~0.015ma.  This would directly feed the mics in the absence of a battery box.

With the battery box (12v battery + 9.1K resistors), I see 12v and \~0.10ma.

The electret mics I'm using typically have 2.2K impedance, require 1-10V, and use ~0.5mA max current.  A schematic of one set of mics I'm using is found [here](https://i.imgur.com/aibNo3C.jpg).  I've tried some prototypes of both the mics and the battery box out, and the recordings sound fine when recording volumes loud enough to require ear plugs - no clipping or anything, but I wonder what the resistors are doing and if the 9.1K ones I've chosen are the best for this application.

E: corrected some values. 

Thanks in advance for any help!

Text: There is a portion of the story I'm writing that involves a stimulant drug that is supposed to keeps one's heart beating for as long as possible while having a relatively short half-life of elimination during extremely stressful situations. Think accelerating at several Gs upwards in a jet.

My current best candidate is Para-Hydroxy-N-Serinylamphetamine.

So, from my knowledge coal and oil are created from biological materials that were laying deep beneath ground and sea floor under high pressure and temperatures.

From that knowledge i figured that if at some point in history there was life on a planet then sooner or later coal and oil would be created.

But the thing is, that coal and oil are created in different circumstances, time frames(not sure about this one) and places.

So, is there a way for coal to be created but oil not at all or at the very least in very small numbers?

Text: So I just got into a huge argument with my boss, a MD at a cancer hospital in a developing country regarding hpv and cervical cancer. 

Allow me to paint the picture: we are working on a grant submission on communicable diseases. The focus is hpv prevention but she wants to focus on cervical cancer, bu I’m adamant that the grantor won’t even review our submission if it’s on cervical cancer. She says to just trust her and don’t argue with her because she’ll escalate it to the medical director and get me fired.

She claims that hpv is the same as cervical cancer as hpv is the major risk factor in 80% to 99.7% of all cases of cervical cancer. My argument is that they’re not the same. Preventing hpv through vaccination and educating patients on safe sex and contraceptive use is not the same as preventing cervical cancer. CDC says that it’s the major risk factor, but hpv infection does not mean a person has cervical cancer. I said that correlation does does mean causation and she says yes it does.

So here I am, on my last straw, on reddit at 6 am asking scientists: is hpv the same as cervical cancer?

Do surgeons take this into account when making incisions to avoid damaging their patient or causing any surgery complications? Do those tiny little cameras along with other imaging methods surgeons like to use help with these things?

Text: I understand that intraplate faults can “absorb” (idk if that’s the right word but we’re rolling with it) stress and subsequently cause earthquakes, but does the fault move when that happens?

Like if you search up a diagram of an earthquake, you will see that one side of the fault will move, usually going up. Or both sides will move in opposite directions while still colliding (ie one going north and one going south)

But isn’t that only possible with interplate earthquakes? Because how can 2 sides of a fault be moving if there inside a tectonic plate?

Text: I was thinking about how trains stop, the engineer pulls a lever which releases air from the brakes, which makes the wheels slow down.

Intuitively longer trains take longer to stop because they have a lot more momentum, but obviously they also have more wheels and brakes. I'm guessing that a 100 car train will have the same &quot;brake to weight&quot; ratio as a 10 car train.

I read that the delay between the lever being pulled and the air being released toward the back of the train contribute to the braking distance. Before the last car even starts braking the train has already moved forward. 

But in a perfect system where all of the brakes are applied at the same time, would a train with 100 cars take longer to stop than one with 10 cars? Assuming each individual car has the same mass and braking force. After all if you had 100 semi trucks driving on a motorway and had them brake at the same time, they'd stop within the same distance as a single semi would. Is that the same for trains?

Text: So spontaneous synchronization is the idea that multiple oscillators that are physically connected in some way, can spontaneously synchronize their oscillations. 

My question is, is it possible to construct some system such that the random vibrations of molecules due to their thermal energy could spontaneously synchronize?  Could macroscopic movement arise from these microscopic thermal vibrations?

It feels like what I'm suggesting would violate the second law of thermodynamics,  but im not entirely sure about that.  As spontaneous synchronization of any oscillators also feels like it'd violate this law yet it obviously is real.

Perhaps it is possible, but only for sufficiently small systems?  I recall from a statistical mechanics class i took years ago that certain weird phenomena were actually possible for sufficiently small systems (such as a decrease in entropy for a small collection of particles, as the more orderly microstates were far more likely simply due to the number of permutations being much smaller)

Edit:  after seeing some comments I'd like to point out that I'm asking if *any* such material/structure could exist.  Obviously most everyday materials do not exhibit this behavior in anyway

Yet when I lie on my right side, I can still feel my heart beating on the left side of my chest, I still hear and feel my stomach gurgling and digesting right beneath my diagram and to the left. Even though gravity ought to be pulling those things down to the right side of my body when I'm lying on my right side. 


What's up with that? What's keeping those organs in place when every time I've seen footage of them in people and other animals it's like they're just kinda lying around in there.

climate change.

Join us today, December 12, with panelists coming in throughout the day, for an AMA presented by the American Society for Microbiology focused on microbes and biogeochemistry. We are experts in biogeochemistry from around the world who will answer your questions and discuss the role the world's smallest living organisms have in climate change contributions (and solutions). We'll discuss impacts of microbial metabolisms on the nitrogen cycle, contributions to methane production and consumption, and effects on levels of carbon dioxide. Ask us anything!

Text: I mean, because friction in space is very close to zero, nothing stands still in position or rotation, so, as a layman, I conclude the universe may be rotating itself, even if it is not of closed geometry. I know the last measurements point to a flat universe but this may also be that the universe is so gigantic we see it flat (like the flat earth illusion, isn't it?). Is there any way, or any research going on to check something as a rotation or torsion of distant regions?

Assuming the signal is strong enough that connection wouldn't be lost, what kind of distortions would we see on earth? Would it appear to slow down as the craft got further away?

What I mean specifically is, they can determine meteroid impacts from tens of thousands of years ago, (like the younger Dryas impact) by finding samples of Iridium in the soil, which they know came from outer space and was not already here in our soil. 

How do we know for example Iridium is from outer space... What was the line of investigation that lead to this firm agreed upon understanding, for any element / metal?

Text: Hello r/AskScience!

Joining us are Lucas Eastham, M.S., Priera Panescu, Ph.D., and Bryan Quoc Le, Ph.D., who are here to answer all your questions about upcycling agricultural &quot;leftovers&quot; for the production of alternative proteins.

**Upcycling sidestreams is a critical step toward creating circular bioeconomies that produce food more efficiently, affordably, and sustainably.** The [Good Food Institute](https://gfi.org/) (GFI), a nonprofit think tank working to make the global food system better for the planet, people, and animals, recently released a new report, &quot;[Cultivating alternative proteins from commodity crop sidestreams](https://gfi.org/resource/cultivating-alternative-proteins-from-commodity-crop-sidestreams/).&quot; Find the GFI Sidestreams analysis report [here](https://gfi.org/resource/cultivating-alternative-proteins-from-commodity-crop-sidestreams/) and webinar [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5HMeQzRU34).

The report identifies sidestreams (&quot;leftovers&quot;) that have tremendous potential to maximize food production via alternative proteins, while also reducing the costs and environmental impacts of agricultural waste. Specifically, this analysis identifies the optimal sidestreams candidates from North America's top crops that could be valorized for (1) protein concentrates for plant-based food ingredients, (2) protein hydrolysates for fermentation or cultivated meat media, and (3) lignocellulosic sugars for fermentation media.

This analysis highlights the major challenges associated with bringing these sidestreams into commercial use for the food industry. It also outlines strategic geographic opportunity areas and the need for public-private partnerships to fully exploit the economic and environmental potential sidestreams offer. Ultimately, the report aims to provide a landscape and actionable insights that commercial, non-profit, and public sector stakeholders can use to direct their efforts in building a sustainable, circular bioeconomy in the food industry.

[Lucas Eastham](https://gfi.org/team/lucas-eastham/) (/u/lucase-GFI) is a Senior Fermentation Scientist at The Good Food Institute, and previously worked for 10 years in microbial biotechnology bioprocess development for biofuels, biofertilizers, food ingredients, and cosmetic ingredients.

[Dr. Priera Panescu](https://gfi.org/team/priera-panescu/) (/u/Chemical_Preaction) is a Lead Scientist at The Good Food Institute. She is focused on analyzing plant-based meat and proteins, and how to expedite their progress. Prior to GFI, she spent nearly a decade working on polymer, formulation, and materials chemistry research.

[Dr. Bryan Quoc Le](https://www.bryanquocle.com/) (/u/UpSaltOS) is a food scientist, food industry consultant, author of [150 Food Science Questions Answered](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1646118332), and Faculty Research Fellow in the Department of Chemistry at Pacific Lutheran University.

We will be available from **12:00PM EST to 4:00PM EST (17-21 UT)** on Monday, December 18th, 2023. Ask Us Anything!

So let's say I had the common cold or whatever you think is the best scenario, and I get sick but as I'm getting better I infect a person in the store and I get better. They then pass it on and on and so forth. 

What is the possibility that you catch the same virus that you originally had, be it weeks, months later? 

Could a virus just have started with one person and just kept spreading throughout history until now? Multiplying through the years? 

Sorry for the post in advance, just random pre-sleeping thoughts.

But then why isn't this the case with humans and UV or Infrared light? As far as I can tell, based on that logic, we should be able to see solely UV light right? In a UV-lit room, we should still be able to see, albeit dimmer and without color. But as far as I can find, this isn't the case.

Text: 

My students have been asking me (A level biology) and I have no real answer.
I understand they must line up for crossing over at the chiasmata but how do the chromosomes know which ones to pair to, why don't they pair to inccorect chromosomes, and I think I have an idea, but how do the loci line up (I assume cytoskeleton, but that then leads to the previous question of how do they know when they have lined up).

Any help is appreciated!

Text: Hey guys, 

I’m posting this before bed so will get back to you tomorrow - but a quick question. 

Why does skin burn in the sun (red or deeper brown), but dead bodies such as those on Everest bleach to a bright white? 

Would it not be the same biological process or is it just because there’s no red/white cells to react to the damage? 

Thanks in advance :)

If someone knows they have covid, they’ll often take the rapid home tests until they show up negative to know they’re in the clear. Can the rapid flu tests pharmacies offer be used in the same way?

I know early on covid pcr tests would show positives for longer than the rapid tests, are flu tests like this as well? Can’t find info on how long flu is detectable on tests or how those tests work!

Text: [According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_water#/media/File:Water_salinity_diagram.png) sea water is 34.7 parts per thousand salt.

Between evaporation and precipitation it seems like this amount is kept largely in equilibrium but, during the last glacial maximum, a lot of this precipitation would have frozen to form glaciers. 

Since that precipitation didn't make it into the ocean it stands to reason that this would have increased the salinity of the oceans. And sure, if the amount of water held in the glaciers was a drop in the bucket compared to the water in the oceans then I guess it wouldn't have made much of a difference.

But, [according to USGS][3]: &quot;global sea level was about 125 meters below today’s sea level at the last glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago&quot;. 

This kinda makes me wonder: how saline were the oceans during the last glacial maximum?

Text: I recently got &quot;diagnosed&quot; with &quot;some sort of arthritis&quot; (they are still figuring things out) and in general have been dealing with random symptoms throughout my life, which has led me to read up on several autoimmune diseases throughout the years.

And they all seem to have one thing in common:  
We have either no idea why they happen (and in some cases not even the mechanism behind the symptoms). Or at most, a host of theories and maybe some knowledge about (potentially) involved genes (but even then, only theories, if at all, as to what actually triggers the onset).

Why is it such a struggle to figure out how autoimmune diseases work?

For comparison, the brain is still considered pretty much a black box and yet it seems to me we have more of a clue about how mental illnesses come to be, how they work, and how to diagnose and treat them, than we have about autoimmune diseases.

Text: I was thinking about this and realised that it’s probably curtailed by a couple of factors: 

1. Their orbital periods are much longer and therefore passing through areas of dust happens on a lower frequency than earth 
2. The density of comets off gassing and emitting dust is lower at distance given the weakened sun power. 

Therefore, I wonder if it is much lower in likelihood. However, do planets such as Uranus and Neptune experience meteors and other ‘shooting stars’ like we do at all?

1. A wire on an automatic gate
2. A wire on a pump/water feature
3. The brakes wire on our caravan

But here’s the odd thing. She isn’t much of a chewer, and she stops chewing the wire after it’s disconnected. The pump wire has been severed months ago. The wires are still hanging, if they were fun to play with before, they’re still fun to play with now. Only difference is now there’s no current flowing, so no magnetic field. And she stopped chewing it.

Idk if this helps but I think all of the wires she bit were DC (connected to battery for the van and solar for the gate and pump). So a static magnetic field, same as Earth’s field, although sharks, for example, can still use it to navigate.

All of the sources online are a bit sus, but there’s a lot that claim that dogs can detect magnetic fields, so I was wondering if anyone here had thoughts on whether my dog can detect magnetic fields or if it was just a coincidence.

Text: Question is in the subject line above. For a more extended backstory behind this question:

This question arises from some research I've been doing on pet food safety. There is a prominent theory that legumes/pulses (like peas, lentils, chickpeas) impact food absorption or body mechanisms in a way that causes diet-associated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) aka enlargening of the heart chamber in dogs and maybe cats (this started from widespread reports to the FDA about grain-free diets and non-genetic DCM cases which led to the FDA issuing an alert and investigation into this issue).

Apparently in the pet food industry, only less than a handful of brands are ever vet-recommended mainly because their ingredients and the interactions of those ingredients in those forms have been researched front and back on safety. Namely corn. 

So apparently, when mixed with meat products, corn is harmless, but legumes might be causing severe heart problems. Why is that? I know there isn't enough research on this specifically, but in a broader sense and theoretical aspect, how can food combinations do this?

Text: Japan and/or SE Asia seems to get an earthquake large enough to destroy homes &amp; severely damage of the infrastructure of entire neighbourhoods &amp; communities at least once every 5-10 years these days. Nevermind Australia or New Zealand or Hawaii. 

But yet, here I am in Britain. And in 31 years of my life I’ve never seen this hit us. Or Ireland. Or Portugal, Spain, France, Africa, North or South America or Iceland or Greenland (too my knowledge). As far as I am aware we just don’t get earthquakes, at least not major ones, seemingly nearly as frequently or as badly as places like Japan, Vietnam, or The Philippines. 

Why is this?

Text: Hello, folks!

I have two quick questions about gravitational waves. Let me say up top, I realize that there's not much we know about them, so I'm perfectly satisfied with 'best guess' answers here. Obviously if there *is* a known correct answer, that's best, but if not, an answer that seems to logically make sense given what we *do* know will work fine!

Now, for the questions!

1. Do gravitational waves diminish over time? Or, rather, do the distortions they cause diminish over time (and space)? Do they start to fade like a ripple in a pond, or do they maintain their level of distorting spacetime as they expand?
2. What is your best guess for how a strong gravitational wave might affect a human body? Would it just kinda pass through a person without being noticed, since it's distorting spacetime and the person is inside spacetime? Or would you feel it, kinda like a pressure wave? Would its effects likely be more macro or micro in scope? What would be your best guess as to how this would affect a human body - or, what might you compare it to? Any medical conditions you might compare it to?

Again, I realize that there's probably very little information to go on, so if we have to resort to conjecture, I'm comfortable with that, but I'd like to base our conjecture on as reasonable information and/or assumptions as possible. So! What do you all think?

Text: Before COVID I didn't really have any concept of &quot;viral load&quot;, I thought that getting infected with a virus was a very binary thing - you get exposed to the virus and you're sick, or you don't get exposed and you aren't.

Now I understand that *how much* of the virus you get exposed to can determine how sick you get. If I got drenched in the face by a sneeze from someone with a high COVID load (funny story: my first COVID infection, I believe, began with a sneeze in the face from my infected 2yo son), I would get a lot sicker than if I my exposure had been much lighter.

Is it this way for all viruses?

Like, with HIV, would I get sicker much faster and progress to AIDS much sooner, if my initial exposure was to a much larger amount of virus?

tldr; question is, do all viral infections vary in intensity according to the magnitude of the exposure? Or are some more &quot;binary&quot;? 

Bonus question:
Is there some concept of &quot;critical viral load&quot;, like, if I get a single HIV viron in my bloodstream, there's a chance it will never find a host and the infection will never happen (right?). But if there are 1000, infection is a certainty (right?). So there's a 'critical value' somewhere in-between (right?). How does this vary for different viruses - are some more *virulent* than others? Someone educate me!

Text: Most birds have a very unusual and particular way of moving--you know, lots of swift, jerky movements, particularly the head when they're looking around. Mammals, even small ones that might occupy the same sorts of niches as some small birds, move much more smoothly. Why is that? Is it something to do with their musculature, or differences in the nervous system, or evolutionary pressures (probably), or what? 

A bonus question: do scientists think that dinosaurs moved similarly? So would a t-rex jerk its head around like a chicken or an ostrich?

Text: I’m sure it depends on their location/climate. Maybe it’s best to focus on comfortable climates. 

I was watching someone on TikTok make the point that Ted Kazinski said in his manifesto that he wanted humans to return to the time before technology started booming because early humans were focused solely on survival and he liked that for some reason.

It all got me thinking, how hard was it out there for early man?

I’m talking pre agriculture Homo sapiens. Part of me agrees and thinks it was hard for my ancient brothers and sisters and that existence would be a constant toggle between fight and flight. But another part of me thinks, wait a minute. Those dudes pretty much had all of my cognitive ability. They just lacked my technology and cultural knowledge. Maybe these guys are smart enough to get food fast and then chill for the rest of the day.

Isn’t that what our technology comes from - leisure time? Maybe these mother fuckers had it in droves. 

To be clear, I’m not saying Ted Kazinsky was on to something. The process of getting back to those days is a non-starter. 

I’m just wondering if there was a golden age of kicking it for thousands of years rolling out of bed and spending 2 hours per day hunting and gathering and then doing an hour or so of chores and shit and then the rest of the day is yours.

I’m seriously amazed we as a species managed to survive in the wilderness with our caloric requirements, assuming there wasn’t a massive shift in those between early humans and now.

Text: Hello,
  

  
I recently had a flu vaccine and was wondering about the effect on older ones.
  

  
From the very limited amount that I understand, the body creates antibodies and memory cells in response to a vaccine, which helps your body fight the disease in future.
  

  
However there is presumably a finite number of possible antibodies and memory cells in a body. As such, does having a new vaccine dilute the effect of previous ones to any significant degree?

As an example, if someone takes a flu vaccine every year for forty years, would this be expected to have an effect on reducing defenses against illnesses they were vaccinated against when a child? 

Many thanks in advance! (I searched to see if this was covered but all responses that come up are questions about COVID vaccines from 2021-23)

Text: It's commonly noted that General Relativity was &quot;proven&quot; with the launch of the GPS satellites and how their internal atomic clocks ran slightly slower than ones on earth, but it's always implied that the orbital velocity is the cause.

In the case of a GPS satellite, is velocity or gravitational time dilation more significant, equal, etc?

Text: Hello folks,

I've got a question about iron in human biology. I know that it's used for lots of things, but I don't really know what it actually does: I know it's present in blood, and I read something about a protein called ferritin that's present in most cells, but I have no idea *how* it assists with blood or what ferritin *does*. And I'm sure iron does other things in the body that I don't know about!

So, I've got three questions:

1. What things does iron do in the body, and how does it do them?
2. What is it about iron that makes it able to do these things? Could another kind of metal do the same thing, or does it *have* to be iron? Maybe another kind of ferromagnetic metal?
3. Does iron interact, or is it involved, with DNA at all? Or no?

I'd appreciate it, too, if you could explain this in as simple terms as possible, because I am not at all a biologist or physician. Thank you!

Text: I was watching some urban exploration stuff on YouTube wasting time when it occurred to me how much infrastructure there is in place for humanity that's gone unmaintained for sometimes whole centuries. I've heard of certain kinds of bacteria that can only thrive on the bones of whales at the bottom of the ocean (Whale fall) and that led me to thinking that obviously humans in all of their ignorance have haphazardly created locations on Earth unlike anything nature could possibly form before leaving them to fall apart.

  
I know that there's been talk of creating a designed bacteria to breakdown and digest plastic for use in environmental contexts, but is there any scientific backing to the notion that mankind has already accidentally created bacteria that flourishes breaking down metal alloys or potentially biohazardous waste that's not naturally occurring? Are there any actual recorded examples of this happening? If there ARE examples of this happening, what brakes are there in place to prevent larger and more complicated life from changing and adapting around manmade structures? Is it out of the question that there may be complicated species that dwell entirely in manmade environments?

Text: Hi. I'm Lisa and I'm a sleep psychologist. I was just on the Washington Post's [&quot;Try This&quot; podcast](https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/try-this/introducing-try-this-/) and also [write columns](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/lisa-strauss/) for the Well+Being section. Looking forward to answering any questions you might have for a longtime practitioner. I love my work and have learned pretty much everything I know from my patients. What really matters is what works for someone in all their individuality.

I started in this field in the 1990s knowing nothing about sleep other than how good it felt and how many psychotherapy patients struggled with it. My boss at the time generously offered me the life-changing job-which I didn't know existed--while we were kibbitzing in the hallway. He might as well have casually suggested that I teach a course on comparative vertebrate morphology. But I learned on the job, and learned through parenting both the toll sleep loss takes and its survivability.  I have increasingly come to appreciate how the disciplines of sleep therapy and psychotherapy inform each other. My practice and the field have evolved a lot since the days of same-old, same-old behavioral advice.

This is of course not a healthcare forum, so any information provided here is for educational purposes only and is not a substitute for personalized, professional care from a qualified healthcare provider. Do consult with a specialist as needed for diagnosis, advice and treatment. Many sleep psychologists and allied professionals can be found through [behavioralsleep.org](https://www.behavioralsleep.org/) or [cbti.directory](https://cbti.directory/). Sleep physicians are usually someone's first stop because they can evaluate for a range of conditions that go beyond the behavioral and psychological.

Text: Hi reddit! We are leading the federal agency charged with setting and supporting the national agenda for mental health research and are excited to talk with you today.

[Joshua A. Gordon, M.D., Ph.D.](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director) is the Director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). He oversees an extensive research portfolio of basic and clinical research that seeks to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure. Dr. Gordon pursued a combined M.D.-Ph.D. degree at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Medical school coursework in psychiatry and neuroscience convinced him that the greatest need, and greatest promise, for biomedical science was in these areas. Dr. Gordon's research focuses on the analysis of neural activity in mice carrying mutations of relevance to psychiatric disease. His lab studied genetic models of these diseases from an integrative neuroscience perspective, focused on understanding how a given disease mutation leads to a behavioral phenotype across multiple levels of analysis. To this end, he employs a range of systems neuroscience techniques, including in vivo imaging, anesthetized and awake behavioral recordings, and optogenetics, which is the use of light to control neural activity. His research has direct relevance to schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, and depression. [Follow Dr. Gordon on Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/NIMHDirector).



[Shelli Avenevoli, Ph.D.](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/organization/od/about-nimh-deputy-director-shelli-avenevoli-phd), is the Deputy Director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). In 2001, Dr. Avenevoli joined the NIMH intramural research program as a staff scientist in the Section of Developmental Genetic Epidemiology of the Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program. In 2005, she moved to the NIMH division of extramural research as Chief of the Emotion, Mood, and Depressive Disorders Program. In 2008, Dr. Avenevoli became Chief of the Developmental Trajectories of Mental Disorders Branch. She has been heavily involved in a number of key NIMH efforts, including revising NIMH's Strategic Plan, re-defining the Institute's approach to supporting research in neurodevelopment and bipolar disorder, and serving as a liaison to other agencies for special initiatives. Prior to joining NIMH, Dr. Avenevoli received her Ph.D. in Developmental Psychology from Temple University, and completed an NIMH-funded postdoctoral fellowship in psychiatric epidemiology at Yale University School of Medicine.

We'll be available starting at 11:00 am ET (16 UT), ask us anything!

Text: I feel like this question gets asked quite often, but I haven't seen any responses that would satisfy my.

Can we be cartain that everyone sees colors the same way? I'm not talking about colorblindness.

People usually reply with ,,we can't know&quot;, or ,,there are slight diffrences&quot;, but I want to know if we can reasonably assume that someone's blue might be another person's red.

I know it's technically possible, because we can't really check color interpretation differences between people, but this doesn't seem right to me. 

Could our brains really perceive colors so differently? I mean if you look at the color spectrum, blue and red are far apart. How would our brains come to such different results? Wouldn't everything have to be swapped around? 

The wavelength of red is around 700nm and the wavelength of blue is around 500nm. If some people saw red as blue, why would their brain jump from orange to blue without any colors in between?

Another thing is, wouldn't that result in a lot of people having color blindness? Chances of having colorblindness are quite low, especially if you have XX chromosomes. Wouldn't a lot of people perceiving colors very differently lead to genes often mixing in a way that would leave some blind spots on the spectrum?

By without any harm I mean, no frost bite or hypothermia even after living in that temperature for hours. Shivering is fine. (Assume the person has access to infinite food, but the human is normal, so can eat only the amount his body allows him to eat and can digest.)

\___

This question is not about internal/core body temperature.


This question came to my mind while I was reading about how some researches found that living in cold temperatures lead to more number of brown fat cells.
And people with higher number of brown fat cells start to shiver at lower temperatures, because brown cells can use energy quicker to heat up the body.

\___

I am trying find the lowest, the temperature which no one can withstand without body getting harmed.

After a couple days I just took down the feeder to see if they'd give up.  Next morning, the bees approach the vacant feeder location as expected and find nothing.  

How long can I expect them to return to this &quot;dry&quot; spot?

I know they communicate food source locations, but can they also tell each other NOT to go somewhere? 

What happens to bad source information in the bee brains? Do they forget?  Or does the info just get replaced by newer better information, like computer reformatting?

If enough warming happened to melt all ice in the oceans, including all of Antarctica, suppose the warming was reversed back to the current climate, would all that ice reform again? If so, what shape would it take? Where would it be? Would Antarctica restore its former shape and structure? 

Or is melting ice a one way street? If that's the case, what if the climate got cooler than it is now, cool enough that ice has to form again? What would the shape of that new ice look like, and where would it go?

Text: Hello everyone,

I'm curious about how to handle number sequences that don't follow traditional linear patterns. For example, we all know a sequence like 2, 4, 6 can be easily described with a function like f(x) = 2*x. But what if we encounter a sequence that doesn't follow such a straightforward pattern? For instance, consider a sequence like 8, 3, 7, 1, -5, or any other seemingly random set of numbers.

My questions are:

1. How can we accurately describe these unconventional sequences using a mathematical formula?
2. Is there a method to predict future values in such sequences, assuming they follow some underlying but non-obvious pattern?

I'm interested in any mathematical or statistical models that could be applied to this problem. Any insights or references to relevant theories and techniques would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you in advance!

Text: **Please read this entire post carefully and format your application appropriately.**

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/15186wx/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxiv/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).
* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)
* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)
* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?
* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

\-------------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

`Username: /u/foretopsail`

`General field: Anthropology`

`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`

`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`

`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`

`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

You can submit your application by replying to this post.

Text: In high school, I used to assume that the bone marrow was connected to the bloodstream in a simple way, and that all blood cells moved into the rest of the body by means of diffusion. But that is not the case. 

Apparently, finished blood cells have to &quot;squeeze&quot; through semi-permeable tissue before they're allowed to enter the veins. I doubt this is accomplished through simple stochastic processes alone. Unfortunately, it's been difficult trying to figure out how this looks at a granular level, and I don't know where to begin. 

I wanted to know more about how this is accomplished, if there are any key gateway proteins or other molecules responsible for the process, if this process looks substantially different for each kind of blood cell (e.g. RBCs, WBCs, platelets, etc.), etc. A brief rundown or series of pointers that can get me going on my own research would help enormously.

Is there a realistic limit on how far a sub-zero cold snap could get? I imagine that tropical regions, with plants than are not frost hardy could get devastated. Is there a chance that we'd see polar vortexes extending into central tropical Mexico? Central America? The Amazon? Across the equator?

Text: I've seen a fair few videos over the last few days of people taking an inch or so of ice from the top of a bucket of water. No sign of ice in the rest of the bucket - which is standing above ground and surrounded by either frost or snow so no obvious insulation to protect it.  

Can somebody explain why only the top layer of water freezes?

Text: So I bought this [light](https://hokolite.com/collections/rechargeable-work-light/products/three-head-construction-led-work-light) to use for climbing at night. The light itself is great and while it doesn't seem like 8000 lumens it does the job plenty well. The unexpected issue I ran into is that on camera the light causes flickering that just about ruins any video I take with them. My guess is that the hz of the light is dropping below the frame rate of the camera. What I don't understand is that doing testing I can use 60fps recording just fine until about 1m15s of the light being on, then the flickering begins. Once the flickering begins I can't even run 30fps recording without it being horrible. I'm able to repeat this every single time on multiple of these lights. What could be causing the light to be operating above 60hz for the first minute but then drop below 30hz thereafter every single time?
  

  
It is a battery operated light but I see this issue regardless of the charge. I will say it is substantially worse on my GoPro 9/mirrorless camera vs my galaxy s21 for the same frame rates but I'm guessing samsung has some kind of smoothing AI it uses that is the cause for that difference. Looking for input on both why that could be happening and if there is anything I can potentially do to fix it (unlikely I know)

Text: From my high school chemistry class, I remember that salts with a higher van't Hoff factor do a better job at lowering the freezing point of water because they disassociate into more particles when dissolved in water. 

It is my understanding that most roads (in the US at least) are salted with sodium chloride, which only has a van't hoff factor of 2 (dissociates into 2 particles, 1 Na+ ion and 1 Cl- ion).  


 Why don't they use a more effective salt that has a higher van't Hoff factor, like Magnesium Chloride (dissociates into 3 particles, 1 Mg+2 ion and 2 Cl- ions)? Wouldn't those salts do a better job at keeping the roads clear?

Text: If you play a note of a certain frequency on a flute and simultaneously sing a note at a different frequency, then you create a third frequency that wouldn't be there if you play or sing in isolation - and the frequency of this subharmonic is the difference of the flute frequency and the voice frequency (I'm talking about the fundamental frequencies for simplicity). This is caused by modulation (product rule: cos(f1*x)cos(f2x) = 0.5*(cos(f1-f2)+cos(f1+f2)), which in turn suggests some nonlinearity in the system.

I made some observations about this effect:

1. It is not unique to flutes- works on any wind instrument (commonly known as Growling on saxophones)
2. It is NOT the Tartini tone / missing fundamental / difference tone. I know it might be tempting to classify it as such, but keep in mind that the Tartini tone is just in your head (caused by some nonlinearity in the hearing apparatus). The subharmonic mentioned here is clearly measurable on a spectrogram.
3. Whistling into the flute does not work. Sure, it produces a beat frequency (linear superposition) and a Tartini tone (illusion in your head), but the subharmonic is not visible on the spectrogram. This suggests to me that the nonlinearity that causes the modulation is somehow in the vocal chords. The problem might be somehow linked to coupled oscillators, but beyond me right now.

Do you have an intuitive explanation for this? Thanks!

Text: Hi everyone.   


As the title says, and this might be a very stupid question: how do we process numbers in the context of longer texts or conversations? 

AFAIK, there's quite a lot written on shorter/longer/bigger/smaller multi-digit numbers from the perspective of mathematical cognition. However, they're studied in isolation from the usual contextual information you'd have if you'd encountered such a number in a 'normal' context, e.g. in conversation. 

Are numbers just processed holistically, somewhat like semantically-meaningful words? Digit-by-digit? How does it work? How are they linked to measurements expressed verbally, e.g. *5 pounds of...*? In short, how do we get from digits to meaningful phrases?

[These](https://www.google.com/maps/place/-23.711641,+120.269599/@-23.7119651,120.2701462,16z/data=!3m1!1e3!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d-23.7116409!4d120.2695991)
I’ve searched far and wide and cannot seem to find any answers. They don’t appear to be the sand ridges of the Simpson desert, they look drastically different, some look like the first picture looks (I see many of these when flying overhead) like off-road tracks/manmade clearing - however they certainly are not as they almost never link to a road, yet are clearly gaps in foliage
Are these survey lines? Mine suitability testing? Maybe even the remains of roads of a ghost town/telegraph line towns?

[These](https://www.google.com/maps/place/23%C2%B010'37.4%22S+122%C2%B033'54.8%22E/@-23.1736845,122.5835532,12z/data=!3m1!1e3!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d-23.1770556!4d122.5652222)

These look like wind erosion to me, however it seems strange to me as looking at wind maps it seems to be heading in the wrong direction/doesn’t correlate with wind patterns (I could be wrong, I’m not meteorologists)

[These](https://www.google.com/maps/place/21%C2%B039'57.7%22S+119%C2%B025'39.1%22E/@-21.6660278,119.4275278,16z/data=!3m1!1e3!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d-21.6660278!4d119.4275278)
This one just baffles me. It’s a huge long hill? It could not possibly be manmade, but there’s no reason for it to have formed the way it does?

I’m actually mostly interested in the first link, as I’ve seen many of those.

Text: Earlier today, I was looking up what caused the glaciation of Antarctica, and also when it took place. As I understand it, the main causes were the appearance of the Circumpolar Current and a drop in global temperatures caused by falling CO₂ levels.

What I couldn't seem to find was an explanation as to ***why*** there was a global drop in CO₂ during the Late Eocene. The Azolla event is theorised to have been responsible for a similar drawdown during the Middle Eocene, but is separated from the Late Eocene by the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum, a period when CO₂ levels were among their highest.

To go from the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum to global temperatures being cool enough to allow permanent ice sheets to form over Antarctica, the drop in CO₂ levels in the Late Eocene must surely have been dramatic, but I couldn't seem to find an explanation as to what had caused/contributed to it.

As a specific example, I'm interested in horses in America. Are those abundant in fossil record before they are thought to have died out??

In general, I am under the impression that for some species at least, fossils aren't very abundant at all, so I wonder how one could conclude that a species died out X thousand years ago if fossils were rare to begin with. Maybe because the preconditions for fossilization weren't there, or the population was small, or other reasons.

Text: Isn't part of knowing something is invasive is because we have a somewhat current record of what species belong where? Thus, any deviation from the present status and an introduction of a new plant or animal into an existing system we can identify as invasive?   


Example: If we stumbled on island A and we identified a certain new creature, we wouldn't know if it arrived there last month, last year, last decade, or it's native to that island since forever. Further, what if we stumbled on another island, not necessarily close by the first island, and there we also found the same creature. How would we know that this creature was a native of island B versus an invader from island A, or vice versa (a native of Island A, and an invader on Island B)?   


If the creature on one island was fluorishing, does that make them invasive? What if the creature did end up on Island B from Island A somehow, but on Island B, they were languishing, not fluorishing? Would they still be invasive, even if they weren't thriving, and would likely die out?

Text: I've been seeing antiviral nasal sprays mentioned more often recently, especially in &quot;covid conscious&quot; communities. The products claim to both block viruses from being absorbed in the nasal cavity and to &quot;inactivate&quot; viruses.

1. Is there any credible evidence that these products do anything to prevent viral infections?
2. Even if these products *did* completely prevent viruses from being absorbed through membranes in the nose, would it matter?

Examples of some products that are being marketed under this umbrella:

- [BioSURE \(Ethyl Lauroyl Arginate Hydrochloride\)](https://bebiosure.com/blogs/blogs/the-science-behind-biosure-pro-protective-nasal-spray-and-why-it-really-does-work)
    - &quot;the BioSURE PRO formulation is able to block and even inactivate the virus to help naturally reduce the risk of infection&quot;
- [Covixyl (also ELAH](https://covixyl.com/pages/about)
    - &quot;The molecule binds to cells in the nose where it blocks the virus from attaching to nasal tissue and inactivates virus particles&quot;
    - &quot;Initial testing against SARS-CoV-2, Rotavirus, H1N1 (Influenza A), and Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) proved the efficacy of ELAH against infection in vitro, showing 99+% reduction across all 4 viruses.  &quot;
- [Enovid \(Nitric Oxide Nasal Spray\)](https://buyenov.com/pages/clinical-data)
    - &quot;...participants who took NONS after COVID-19 exposure were 75% less likely to become infected when compared to the control group...&quot;
    - &quot;After confirmed exposure to COVID-19, infection rate in participants (n=625) who took NONS™ was 6.4% versus 25.6% in the control group (P&lt;0.0001).&quot;
- Bonus: [Xlear \(Xylitol\)](https://xlear.com/xlear-sinus-care/). Not *currently* claiming anything about COVID, I assume because they are being [sued by the FDA](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/10/ftc-sues-utah-based-company-falsely-claiming-its-nasal-sprays-can-prevent-treat-covid-19)

This also made me curious on a wider scale though: did we actually make better food (in regard to animal products like meat and dairy) in the past? When looking it up I came across an answer to a similar question someone asked on Quora (which I’m taking with a grain of salt) that said that due to things like feedlot farming and things like feeding cows corn due to the low cost and efficiency, even though it’s not their regular diet, can cause an animal to be stressed. In turn, apparently the adrenaline and cortisol can affect the taste of the meat. I know that things like diet and exercise for an animal can affect the taste of its meat, but can stress-related chemicals really do the same? And how does this hold true for something like foie gras, where birds certainly must be under stress as they are force fed in order to engorge the liver, yet most people enjoy foie gras for its taste, as well as its texture?

Text: So I am rereading Project Hail Mary at the moment. 

In the book, the main character meets an alien, named Rocky, who lives on a planet with such a thick atmosphere that light can't reach the ground. The characters talk with each other about their biology at length in order to learn about one another, and they talk a lot about sleep, too. Rocky has a weird sleep cycle and lives on a planet that also spins very fast. His sleep cycle does not seem to match his planet's day-night cycle. 

This got me wondering about Earth life. From what I understand, all animals sleep, it's almost a biological mandate. Even though some are nocturnal, it seems that sleep cycles are still, somewhat, in tune with the rotation of the Earth. Sunlight would be the main indicator for the body for any creature that can see daylight. 

But what about animals that live in total darkness, like in caves or deep in the ocean? Do we know anything about their sleep patterns? If we do, do they somehow follow a day/night cycle?

I suspect we probably know very little about these animals, but I'm really curious about this.

Text: After doing some reading I have heard that herpes viruses tend to break out in a person after a variety of triggers, such as stress, sun exposure, illness, hormonal changes etc…, and people can avoid outbreaks by avoiding these causes.  These sources have also stated, however, that it is unclear whether or not these directly impact outbreaks. Furthermore, it is known that lots of people with herpes tend to never show any symptoms, while others may experience them highly frequently. Is there a definite correlation between these triggers and outbreaks, and can a person’s immune system or genetics play a role in their occurrences?

Text: Obviously using a hypothetical balloon that would not collapse.  Given this hypothetical (rigid?) balloon is the same weight as a normal helium balloon.  

First thought is no, because a new unfilled balloon has nothing in it right?  But it also relates to the atmospheric pressure upon the balloon with regards to its surface area and volume, right?

So when we say “helium is lighter than air”, are we also implying that it is less dense?   So using aeroplanes as an example of higher pressure and lower pressure air acting upon the wings to create lift?

Text: The paradox of hair loss is that while we seem to lose the hair on our heads, it tends to increase everywhere else on our bodies.

Many men entering their 40s and 50s will develop baldness. That said, they paradoxically seem to gain body hair in other place. Some examples of this may be thicker beards or ear hair or thicker chest and back hair.

My question is why does the process which causes hair loss on the tops of our heads not impact hair on the rest of our bodies? It seems like we start off young with a full head of hair and lack of body hair. Then we lose our hair and our bodies go into hair growth overdrive.

Is there an answer as to why?

Text: Nov-22 through Apr-23 had some record breaking snowfall in Minnesota (probably some other places, but I don't track other places' snowfall)

We're now approaching Nov-23 through Feb-24 with only one thing that I think could be considered a snowstorm which laid down, like, 2 inches.

Is this just regression to the mean? Completely random chance? Or is there a higher chance of light snowfall the year after a winter with heavy snowfall?

Text: Its my understanding (please correct me if Im wrong) that the difference between diluted ethanol and an alcoholic drink (say whisky) is the presence of congeners - a complex mix of dissolved compounds that develop during production and maturation. Break-down of fermentation/distillation products and the acquisition of solutes present in the oak casks, result in a highly complex mixture of compounds. These compounds, collectively referred to as congeners are what determine the taste/smell of the whisky. The abundance/concentration of various individual congeners is what separates Lagavulin from Laphroaig and more broadly, what separates different kinds of whisk(e)ys.

Lets say you have a well equipped anal chem lab and unlimited time/money. You acquire a bottle of Lagavulin just before its casked, analyze it and then 16y later obtain a bottle from the same cask for comparison. Are modern spectrometry and other analytical techniques advanced enough to confidently identify the precise composition/identity of congeners present in each bottle?

If so, is it possible to isolate (or alternatively, synthesize) the individual congeners in the mature bottle and then add them to the pre-cask whisky (at the measured concentrations) to &quot;instantly&quot; mature it? Or is the chemistry during maturation too complex to define and/or reproduce accurately?

Or better yet, as a pipe dream develop a lyophilized &quot;congener concentrate&quot;  (ideally one free of histamine and other biogenic amines) that one could reconstitute with ethanol+water.

Obviously the cost effectiveness in either case would be questionable. But if you had best proc dev team on earth and could consistently isolate/reconstitute the congeners at large scales, I'd wager it could reap huge profits over the long term.

Text: So, if we pretend there is no air/atmosphere, it seems like a projectile launched exactly vertically will always land in the same spot. This makes sense for things like a baseball, an arrow, or even a bullet shot out of a gun. But what happens when we really push the envelope and say hypothetically we shoot something straight up at a wicked initial velocity of, lets say, 15,000 m/s. The projectile will travel several thousand miles above the surface of the earth, until gravitational acceleration eventually overcomes the initial velocity and it falls back to the earth. Will it land in the exact same spot?? Or because the earth is rotating, will it land in a different spot? Would it make a difference if you launch it from the north pole or from the equator? According to newton's equations, our projectile would land almost an hour after it was launched.

While it is a fantasy novel I do prefer to keep stuff like this accurate so was wondering what would actually occur as the mountain heats up in as much detail as possible.

I can clarify if needed but these are the factors I know will be relevant:

1. Heavy snowfall (let's say 4.5 feet)

2. Mountain heating up from near the base

3. Relatively conical mountain

Thanks for all the help everyone! I think I got a good basis to make everything work and be at the very least not so far off it doesn't make sense.

Text: I understand the risk of pregnancy is a huge, if not the main factor in this - 

But I saw this article yesterday:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2024/02/01/why-women-have-more-autoimmune-diseases/

It mentions that overwhelmingly, research is done on men, which I’ve heard. So they only just now are discovering a potential cause of a huge health issue that predominantly affects women.

And it got me thinking - surely we could involve more of us gals in research by selecting menopausal women, prepubescent girls, maybe even avowed celibate women.

I’m sure it would be limited to an extent because of that sample size, but surely it would make a significant difference in understanding our unique health challenges, right? I mean, I was a girl, then an adult woman who never got pregnant, then a post-menopausal woman… any research that could have helped me could have been invaluable.

Are there other barriers preventing studying women’s health that I’m not aware of? Particularly ones that don’t involve testing medication. Is it purely that we might get a bun in the oven? 

Edit: thanks so much for the very detailed and thought provoking responses. I look forward to reading all of your links and diving in further. Much appreciate everyone who took time to respond! And please, keep them coming!

Text: When we breathe, we use the oxygen of the air to oxydize our body sugar or fat to produce energy (via ATP molecules). Water and carbon dioxyde (CO2) are by-products of these reactions. ATP is used by our muscles to move. Water is easily recycled within our body and we finally exhale the CO2. So O2 in, energy and water in the middle and CO2 out.

Now, we don't inhale oxygen, we inhale air which is roughly made of 80% nitrogen, 20% oxygen and a few other molecules in very little quantities. So does our body handle or process the nitrogen in the air, and if so, how ?

so I've read that you cannot carbon date rocks. However, these &quot;stone tools&quot; were dated to 3.7 million years old.

Ok, so 2 questions:  
1) Frankly, they look like random pieces of rock. I'm willing to bet that if I walked to a hill, I can pick up 3/4 of those rocks. How would these scientists know that they are tools indeed?  


2) I've read that radiocarbon dating cannot work on rocks, and it definitely cannot be used to date items past the 60 000 years mark. How would anyone be able to even accurately date it?

Text: Sea water contains [roughly 35,000mg of salt per liter (1000ml).](https://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/ocean/sea-water) At 20 °C (68 °F), [one liter of water can dissolve about 350,000mg of salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_water) (10x the amount in sea water). Adult humans should have no more than [2,300mg salt per day](https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-education-resources-materials/sodium-your-diet), which I assume is related to how much salt the kidney can (safely) filter. (I couldn't find anything related to the kidney's salt-filtration power after several minutes of googling.)

By my flawed logic, humans should be able to drink some small amount of sea water, excrete the excess salt using a fraction of the sea water consumed, and then keep the remaining desalinated sea water for hydration.

Using hard numbers: Consume 25ml of sea water containing \~875mg salt, urinate \~3ml of water containing all \~875mg of salt, keep \~22ml water for hydration.

Even if salt can't be excreted at the density at which it can be dissolved, there's still room for more water to be used for urination that's also less than the amount consumed.

I know I've taken several logical leaps here, but without additional information I have no choice but to wonder. What am I missing? Thank you.

Curious in this day in age and all the sugary drinks and such how it could replace, not that it should, some of the ways we are used to getting our daily supplements. Perhaps even does and we don't realize it commonly but interesting to know if it can entirely. I feel some issues would pop up at some point.

I've heard the reason we don't have much fossil evidence or complete fossil evidence from stages before the K-P extinction event is because many animals were scavenged upon dispersing the bodies. So, with the rapid change in climate, mass die-off after the asteroid collision, and destruction of so many millions, if not billions of animals with very few larger non-avian dinosaurs to destroy the evidence then where are the fossils?

Text: It is my understanding that traveling very close to the speed of light would blueshift incoming photons, for example turning infrared light into UV-light. A person traveling at this speed would be exposed to highly energetic photons, thereby tanning (or violently vaporizing) them.

But would I as an outside stationary observer observe the same thing? To me it would look like the person is exposed to infrared light, which doesn’t have enough energy to tan skin. How would this be explained?

I've also heard of but never really studied the process of producing an animal in a lab with a single set of maternal DNA. It seems to me that for this to be done successfully whoever is producing this animal would need to find a way of reproducing methylation patterns that occur during spermatogenesis otherwise the resulting specimen would be unviable. I assume I am either grossly misinformed about how cloning animals work or am missing an important part about imprinting. Thanks for any help this question has been driving me crazy since I first heard about imprinting but don't feel compiled to invest the time it would take to figure it out myself.

Text: I know in general that when things go wrong that the body can and that is basically how we can get cancers or invasive scaring, but in general, how does the body know not to go haywire? For instance, when a tooth breaks, the gum tries to heal and seal over the broken bits if left untreated in the gum. Why doesn't this happen to our teeth in general, then? When we get a cut or burn, the wound seals, but even if it is bad, such as a whole hand injury, you generally don't get fingers fusing together. I would attribute some to movement, but this doesn't solve every case. There are people that can't eat or talk and their teeth are normal. There are people that are immobilize after serious injury and they heal normally. Is dna really that complex that it knows how to heal a finger, an arm, that it knows when to stop the healing process and when to reactivate it? Is there not an answer yet and that is why we can't trigger these mechanisms ourselves to grow new limbs for instance?

Text: In light of the seeming extinction of the Influenza B/Yamagata lineage, the WHO recommended in September that “the inclusion of a B/Yamagata antigen as a component of influenza vaccines is no longer warranted, and every effort should be made to exclude it as soon as possible.&quot;

The response to this has been that the flu vaccine market is shifting back to the trivalent vaccine used up until QIVs were introduced. The WHO has also acknowledged that additional support will be needed for manufacturers who currently only make quadrivalent vaccines to pivot to making trivalent vaccines.

However, my question is -- if we're already prepared to produce quadrivalent vaccines, why don't we take the &quot;slot&quot; opened by B/Yamagata to immunize for a third variety of Influenza A? For example, the Northern &amp; Southern hemisphere currently have different recommendations for the H3N2 vaccine component. Wouldn't it make more sense to have both H3N2 varieties packaged together and utilize the existing technology for a quadrivalent vaccine?

Text: I am trying to learn about the near-field and far-field effects of antennas, but do not have the necessary background to understand. My knowledge of electromagnetic physics begins and ends by approximating what comes out of an antenna as a plane-wave over a sufficient distance.

However, when reading about the near-field, many descriptions of it refer to the em waves *reacting* with the antenna. This makes me wonder: hypothetically, if a massless, chargeless point in space began emitting electromagnetic waves, would there exist a near-field about this point in space, or would there be no near-field due to there being nothing for the waves to interact with?

If I give blood while taking escitalopram, will there be an amount in my donated blood? Is the amount negligible, or is the amount meaningful, but not considered dangerous to the recipient?

The excluded medications, are they to protect the donor, recipient or both?

Text: I was thinking about concussions and how devastating they can be to the brain and I wondered if there were ways to mitigate the damage sustained from your brain smacking across solid bone. Then I thought about how woodpeckers protect themselves with their tongue as padding. I wondered why humans hadn’t evolved a similar soft tissue padding inside their skulls before realizing we didn’t have much need for it as head injuries probably weren’t a common cause of death in our history. Then I thought about how Neanderthals are said to have bigger brains and I’m assuming we think that because they had larger skulls and assumed it must’ve been filled with more Brian’s. But I’ve heard they were able to take much larger blows, say from a big animal, and survive. Being knocked around because of an insistence to use melee combat when hunting as opposed to spear probably would result in alot of deaths due to head injuries. So my question is, is there a possibility that they had larger skulls to make room for a kind of soft tissue padding for their brains? I mean if they had larger brains wouldn’t they have figured out that if they were dying to Homo sapiens because they’re throwing spears then maybe they should’ve done the same?

Text: I recently learned that *Oryctolagus cuniculus*, the European rabbit, is considered endangered in its home range. This is the same species which gave rise to the domestic rabbit, which has been introduced elsewhere in the world and become a pervasive introduced species that can disrupt local ecosystems.

I'm curious now how common this is, and what the impacts of these kinds of situations are on conservation projects; I'm also wondering if this may become more common as climate changes and the habitable ranges of plants and animals move outside of their historical ranges.

What kinds of plants and animals are simultaneously endangered in their natural range, and detrimentally invasive in other areas?

Are there any notable examples of species that are fully extirpated from their native range, but where introduced wild populations continue to thrive elsewhere? If so, how do conservationists approach these situations?

Text: ASTM E595 outlines the process to test and requirements required to pass outgassing for space and other critical systems. It is generally considered the “standard” for all outgassing testing criteria, at least in my field. 

What I am struggling to understand is why the TML (total mass loss) is adjusted down based on the WVR (water vapor recovered)? 

The process states that the test sample will be exposed to a 50% RH environment for 24 hours then put into the test environment, which is some X hours at some T temperature (can’t remember exactly what these values are). 

The mass lost in the test environment relative to the mass after the 24hr exposure to 50% RH is the TML. 

Afterwards, there is an “optional” step where the sample is re-exposed to the same 50% RH environment for 24hrs and its mass is measured again. The mass regained can then be deducted from the previously calculated TML to get the adjusted value. 

Why is this allowed? Does outgassing in space not care about water vapor? If so, why not? 

Edit: to any one who is curious: I reached out to the ASTM standards people and got a response from the engineers responsible for outgassing standards and she said that they allow for the exclusion of WVR for the same reasons that SAE standard allows for the reduction of TMR (I may have gotten the acronyms wrong, sorry I’m drinking lol). 

That is, water vapor is reduced in *some* but not all cases because generally speaking water vapor is not considered to be a major contaminant in space applications. I believe this is due to the fact that small amounts of water will sublimate in space and so it will not cause condensation issues and will simply dissipate into space. 

However, it is ultimately up to the client/customer to determine whether or not they approve of the use of WVR to meet the 1% TML standard.

Text: Electrical ground seemed simple at first, but the more I've studied electronics the less I've understood it.   
Examples of confusion are:  


The earth, dirt, seems pretty insulating. If I touch an electric fence wearing rubber boots, I wont be shocked, but without those boots I should be. What makes rubber such a better insulator than dirt to prevent me from being shocked? How can electricity travel to the &quot;ground&quot; when the ground (earth) is non metallic?

A 3 phase delta generator, going through a rectifier, to a load, to ground, according to my teacher will have no current going through it since the ground doesn't connect back to the delta generator. Why must the current return to the generator, couldn't it dissipate into &quot;ground&quot;.   
A DC circuit I can understand needing to complete the loop, however with AC it seems like I should be able to generate electricity, send it out somewhere, without the need for return.   


Ground has been defined as 0 volts. A car chassis is connected to &quot;ground&quot;. If I then connect the car to the earth, does the car chassis no longer have exactly 0 volts, since the earth is *more ground?*

Text: So after the Big Bang, everything was sent shooting off at a zillion miles per hour in all different directions. Since everything was going in an outward trajectory from the point of the Big Bang (if space is even considered to have existed then), and assuming there's no/negligible drag on a galaxy zooming through space, how would the velocities of Milky Way and Andromeda change to now be directed towards the point of collision? The only thing I can think of is if they're pulling on each other via gravity, but that seems unlikely given their distance of 2.537 million lightyears.

Can a galaxy's trajectory through space curve?

Are both the Milky Way and Andromeda headed in the same direction, and one is catching up to the other? But if that's the case, why would one of them be slowing down?

Text: After three years and 72 flights over the surface of Mars, [NASA's Ingenuity helicopter](https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/) has touched down for the last time. Imagery downlinked from the helicopter indicated that one or more of its rotor blades [sustained damage during its Flight 72 landing on Jan. 18, 2024](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/9540/after-three-years-on-mars-nasas-ingenuity-helicopter-mission-ends/), rendering it no longer capable of flight.

Designed as a technology demonstration that was expected to fly no more than five times over 30 days, the helicopter's primary mission was to prove that powered, controlled flight on another planet was possible, which it did on April 19, 2021. But Ingenuity exceeded expectations, [transitioning into an operations demonstration](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-ingenuity-helicopter-to-begin-new-demonstration-phase) that paved the way for future aerial exploration on the Red Planet and beyond.

So, have you ever wanted to know what it's like to fly a helicopter on another planet? Or what it's like to [talk to the helicopter](https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/385/keeping-our-sense-of-direction-dealing-with-a-dead-sensor/) from here on Earth? Or what we've learned from Ingenuity that can be used for possible future aerial exploration on other worlds?

I tried googling this, but the results just show 'breastfeeding helps keep the baby calm'. 

Edit: I don't know why everyone seems to get from the above that I won't have my child vaccinated anymore. My child will be vaccinated, we were just curious if there wasn't an easier way to pass it onto the baby.

Text: I was wondering, what if the tilt of the Earth with respect to the Sun was fixed somehow - so, for example, we take its tilt on December 21 and so, now, Earth is tilted North-away from the Sun forever.

I was thinking about how it gets colder in winter since the winter hemisphere is tilted away from the Earth (and vice-versa for summer) - but then it starts to tilt back again after the Solstice (since the Earth's axial tilt is actually fixed with respect to, I dunno, &quot;space&quot;), and so the cooling stops and things start warming up again. If the tilt were fixed, how much colder would the winter hemisphere get? How much hotter would the summer hemisphere get? How close do we get to whatever the &quot;equilibrium winter/summer&quot; would be?

*I know this is impossible*, I know that it would require the Earth's rotation to actually constantly be changing, which couldn't happen and would cause some other maybe catastrophic things to happen if you were to somehow force it to happen. I really just want to understand about just how far the whole &quot;getting colder/warmer as we move towards the solstices&quot; thing could go, hypothetically.

Thanks!

Thinking about stuff like Mt. Saint Helens for example: There were warnings in place, and fortunately the area is thinly populated in Skamania, WA. Yet given all the protective measures we have in place today, could a pyroclastic stream like that destroy a city like that and killing all the people, or would we be able to evacuate in time? Could we be taken by surprise by a quick and unwarranted eruption, or are there always warning signs, quakes, etc.?

Text: I was using a pretty realistic map generator, which at one point yielded a very interesting feature on one of the continents: a river that began in the arctic tundra of the southern hemisphere, and snaked its way through taiga and steppes and deserts and forests, well into the tropics, until it reached the sea north of the equator. Depending on the season, parts of the river, in the desert, almost dried out, while at peak, the river's discharge when it entered the sea in the tropics was about 3 million m^(3)/s. I think the river was at least 13 000 km long? Winding of course...

Does anything of this seem remotely plausible? The Nile isn't nearly that long, I mean in terms of distance from the equator. The longest river I seem to be able to find any evidence of, prehistorically I mean, seems to be closer to 10 000 km. And that discharge... isn't it more than all rivers of Earth combined? I know much higher discharge rates have occurred in geological times, like the Zanclean flood, which was much, much bigger, or the Missoula floods... but they were very temporary. Could such a high discharge as this fictional river actually work, if continents looked differently? Would so much water in a river system somehow affect the climate, or is that amount of water still far too small to be noticed in the grand scheme of things? Rather: could enough water even be deposited by rain, or from glacier melt water?

Text: I know that the differing red/black color is due to differing X chromosome inactivation, and that the white color is due to the piebald gene altering the migration of pigment producing cells across the body, but how do these interact? Why is it that in an individual cat, there’s bigger patches of color next to white spots but it’s more brindled farther away? Is the white spot stopping the spread of one color but not another? I’m guessing it isn’t actually doing anything with the X activation or gene expression and instead is about the physical movement of pigment or how the cells divide, but Im not sure exactly how it works. 

Mostly I guess I just want to know how the pigment cells spread over the body to make patterns in animals.

Text: Hi! My name is Dr. Christine Wilkinson, and I'm a National Geographic Explorer and an expert in human-wildlife interactions, conservation science, and carnivore ecology. I am a member of the [IUCN SSC Hyaena Specialist Group](https://www.iucn.org/our-union/commissions/group/iucn-ssc-hyaena-specialist-group#:~:text=The%20mission%20of%20the%20IUCN,hyaenas%2C%20brown%20hyaenas%20and%20aardwolves.) and currently specialize in spotted hyenas and coyotes- in particular, determining how they move through human-altered landscape, what drives their interactions with people, and how environmental justice underpins all of it. Check out our new beta webpage for our organization on hyena coexistence, the [Humans and Hyenas Alliance](https://hyenacoexistence.org/). For my research, I use tools such as motion sense cameras, GPS collars, remote sensing, and community participatory mapping. I've also served as a scientific expert (on and off screen) for several past and upcoming productions ([IMDB page](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm15708075/)), created an ongoing TikTok series called [Queer is Natural](https://www.tiktok.com/@thescrappynaturalist/video/7106496770196409646?_r=1&amp;_t=8ZquZIuK3FS), and co-founded [Black Mammalogists Week](https://blackmammalogists.com/). It's one of my missions in life to recognize scientists as kaleidoscopic beings whose diverse experiences and perspectives can improve science and wildlife conservation!

Hello world! I'm Christine Dell'Amore, a senior editor at National Geographic specializing in wildlife, especially underrepresented species. So, you could say I'm a fan of the underdog. I've written stories about [dung beetles that navigate by the Milky Way](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/dung-beetles-milky-way-navigation), [coyotes that raise pups in downtown Chicago](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/141121-coyotes-animals-science-chicago-cities-urban-nation), and now, in the March issue of *National Geographic* magazine, [female spotted hyenas that are queens of their kingdom](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/spotted-hyenas-queens)! Did you know hyenas are actually doting moms, clever problem solvers, and the most successful hunter in all of Africa? Ask us anything!

To learn more about hyenas and other matriarchs in the animal kingdom, watch Queens, a Nat Geo original series, now streaming on Disney+ and Hulu.

We'll be here at 11am EST (16 UT). Ask us anything!

Text: I understand that we could (up until recently) communicate very slowly with Voyager I. I also understand that Voyager I's nuclear generator will stop working at some point (I've seen some reporting that the generator will stop working around 2025). Once Voyager is fully powered down or has broken to the point where it cannot communicate with us (which may be the case right now?), can we still track Voyager I with direct sensing? In other words, I understand that with astrophysical simulation we can estimate where Voyager is at any time in the future, but once Voyager can no longer transmit back to us, do we have any way of &quot;seeing&quot; voyager. In other words, are we able to aim a very powerful telescope at Voyager and see a reflection (or a transit of a star?). Could we aim a laser at Voyager and confirm that Voyager is where we thought it was by the reflection of the laser?  In other words, once Voyager I stops transmitting to us, would we have any way of knowing that it still exists (as opposed to, say, crashing into a rogue asteroid)?

I saw a chernobyl documentary where they specifically said that it wasnt the particles in the air but the air and water itself that became radioactive.... 

Was that just wrong information is it actually possible to spread radioactivity into other materials?

I always assumed that if a radioactive object is air tight sealed it doesnt make the room Radioactive.... ofc while the Uranium piece is there you can measure it but as soon as you put it away the room should be completely clean and free of anything but the natural background radiation....

Text: We have a fact: Visible light can't resolve very small things, as an explanation its said visible light has too big of a wavelength to resolve the incredibly tiny object.  


That's fair, something about light is too big to resolve the tiny object, however I can't wrap my mind around how did we decide this property is wavelength, and why would wavelength affect light's ability to resolve? Therefore my questions are:  


1. Wavelength is essentially the distance between two waves, therefore this property doesn't exist when there's a single wave. What'd happen if we tried to resolve an object by a single light wave?
2. If it's really the wavelength that matters in resolving objects, then red light should have less resolution power than purple light. Is this the case, backed by any experiments?

Text: If you look up the definitions today, a second is defined as the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of a caesium-133 atom's… vibration (I suppose?) while the meter is defined as the distance travelled by light in 1 / 299,792,458 seconds.

These definitions were definitely never taught to me in school, growing up. I guess I never asked enough questions as a kid, and just accepted second to be 1 / 60 of a minute, which is 1 / 60 of an hour, which is 1 / 24 of a day, while meter is pretty much the length stated by every ruler I've ever owned.

What if a kid is to ask me these questions today, though? Or if my future kid asks it? How and why is a second a second, or a meter is a meter? How do I explain these things in a way a kid can relate to, without going into what's caesium, or what's caesium-133, or why caesium, or why 9,192,631,770?

The meter is definitely something I'll grapple with too. I accepted the meter for what it is in day-to-day life before I learnt the speed of light in school, so the concept of defining the meter according to the distance travelled by light feels extremely circular-logic-ish in my head.

What's the accepted layman, non-pedantic definitions for SI units (not just second and meter) commonly used in day-to-day life, in terms which is relatable in day-to-day contexts?

Text: Hello Reddit! I'm Joao De Aquino, an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine. My work uses behavioral pharmacology, psychophysical methods, and clinical trial strategies to develop novel treatments for pain and addiction. Joining me today are Julio Nunes, a PGY-2 Psychiatry Resident, and Gabriel Costa, a medical student, who both play integral roles in our Pain and Addiction Interaction Neurosciences (PAIN) Lab. Our latest work, a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis featured in the American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse (AJDAA), revealed that cannabis use does not significantly change non-medical opioid use among individuals undergoing opioid use disorder treatment. This finding challenges many outdated policies in U.S. opioid treatment settings, where people who use cannabis might encounter obstacles to accessing crucial medications for opioid use disorder, such as methadone and buprenorphine. We're here and eager to engage with your queries about addiction science, approaches to treating substance use disorders, or insights on publishing within the field of addiction.

But do we know why these specific fields will be excited and create those particles, instead of exciting the photon field and create a bunch of those instead?

If a person could experience LESS than the number of light-years traveled, it would seem that talk of 'astronaut hibernation' is unnecessary.

Text: Overwhelmingly, the answers I've seen to this question on Reddit and elsewhere are anecdotal, so I would love to read any answers supported by strong research. However, I recognize that designing studies to answer this question are probably challenging due to sample size concerns, confounding, selection biases, etc.
  

  
A few important qualifiers to this question:
  

  
(1) I am specifically referring to primary and secondary education, not post-secondary education.
  

  
(2) I recognize that &quot;life outcomes&quot; is vague, but my goal was to keep the scope broad. Things that come to mind when I think of &quot;life outcomes&quot; which could be impacted by school type include, but are not limited to: substance use disorders/mental illness in childhood or adulthood; non-psychiatric illness in adulthood; expected lifetime wealth; expected lifetime career satisfaction; expected marital/relationship satisfaction; etc.

(3) I'd be open to comparisons between children who attend &quot;average&quot; private schools vs. those who attend &quot;average&quot; public schools... OR other comparisons, such as children who attend &quot;average&quot; private schools vs. those who attend &quot;above-average&quot; public schools. Again, I recognize that what constitutes an &quot;average&quot; school, or an &quot;above-average&quot; school, is vague, but I'd be open to any number of different operationalizations of these constructs (e.g., student-teacher ratios, AP classes offered, number of extracurriculars offered, etc.).

What about muscular people? They also have more cells to maintain, and their body is bigger.

Building muscles is believed to have many benefits: lower diabetes risks, better musculoskeletal functions, etc.
Having said that, do those benefits cancel out with the similar low-longevity risks that tall people have?

Text: I found sources saying that the Pauli Exclusion Principle was more important than electrostatic repulsion for why you can &quot;touch&quot; objects which I don't understand. This implies that Degeneracy Pressure is a kind of &quot;force&quot;, except with no mediating particle.
  

  
This is the way I understand it, suppose you have a region of space filled with electrons. They all repel each other, but you can overcome this repulsion by exerting more and more force. The resistance you feel has absolutely nothing to do with the Pauli Exclusion Principle. However, you will eventually reach a point where you quite literally can't anymore. This is because the Pauli exclusion principle says that any further compression will result in the electrons occupying the same space, which makes no sense since their wave functions are anti-symmetric. It's not a force, but more like a rule of reality that prevents any further compression.

If this estimation is based on our current/recent frame of reference, some other being on some other planet should just as easily say age of the universe is around 100 years and we should both be correct. Which should mean trying to calculate age of the universe is not really useful or meaningful?

Adding to that, suppose someone go back 6 billion years in time and try to calculate age of the universe. Wouldn't their frame of reference be much more different than ours? So, would they come up with an age of around 8 billion years?

Text: Why do humans and similar animals have 5 fingers (or four fingers and a thumb) and not some other number? (I'm presuming the number of non-thumb fingers is even because it's 'easier' to create them in pairs.)

Is it a matter of the relative advantage of dexterous hands and the opportunity cost of developing more? Seven or nine fingers would seem to be more useful than 5 if a creature were being designed from the ground up.

For that matter, would it not be just as useful to have hands with two thumbs and a single central finger?

Text: So this applies to multiple diseases, but the one in the news the most lately is obviously covid. For that reason, I'm using covid as the example, but the question goes for any disease.

After recovering from covid, it's estimated that a person has one month of near immunity, which tapers down to a mild resistance over the following two months, and then no resistance once three months have passed. (These figures may not be precise, but it's the concept that's important here.) While there's no guarantee, even in that first month, that you won't catch it again, it is less likely. So my question is:

If you were exposed on a weekly basis to covid, starting one week after recovering from having it... would it effectively refresh your period of heavy resistance? Assuming you didn't get unlucky and actually *catch* it any of the subsequent exposures, that is.

Text: I've spent a lot of time recreating in the mountains in the northeastern US. I understand that the mountains there were shaped by the Laurentide Ice Sheet 10k+ years ago. This massive glacier reached all the way down to Long Island in NY State, which I understand is actually a glacial moraine. Today, the nearest glaciers to the region aren't anywhere close (Baffin Island maybe?). 

Conversely, I've also spent time in the Washington Cascades, which are still riddled with glaciers; some sizeable, but most are small in the grand scheme of things. I've been told that these glaciers used to be much larger in Washington, but even at the peak of the Ice Age, glaciers didn't even reach down to some of the valley floors in the eastern Cascades. 

So why is it that the Laurentide Ice Sheet formed and receeded so dramatically over thousands of miles in the northeast US, while the Pacific Northwest merely saw a growing and shrinking of our modern day glaciers? I know glaciers form when annual temperature and snowfall combined to prevent snow from fully melting during the summer. By that logic, the weather patterns over the Ice Sheet must have been wildly different than they are today, even a greater difference than the weather was and is in the PNW today.

Text: For example, since according to relativity there is no preferred reference frame, to a neutrino moving at 99% c towards me, it could look like I am actually moving at 99% c towards it. But in the latter reference frame, I'm an object dozens of orders of magnitude more massive than the neutrino moving near the speed of light, so I should have an absolutely absurd amount of kinetic energy. Now imagine I bump into another person, or even just move through air particles; at such a speed, the resulting collision should be equivalent to detonating several nuclear weapons. Basically, the question becomes, doesn't the fact that we are not constantly exploding all the time imply that there is a preferred frame of reference, in this case the one in which the neutrino is moving at relativistic speed and I am not?

**Kan Cao** is a renowned scientist, anti-aging authority and professor of cell biology and molecular genetics at the University of Maryland. She has been studying human aging and in particular the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome (HGPS), a premature aging disease that claims most victims by age 13. While conducting research on aging and HGPS, Kan's lab discovered that a common dye, methylene blue, had incredible anti-aging properties for human skin. With support from UM Ventures, she started Mblue Labs and launched Bluelene Skincare, the first commercially available methylene blue anti-aging cream.

Text: Delta IV and Delta IV Heavy sets itself on fire right before takeoff. This is expected behaviour and looks alarming but it's OK, they know it's going to happen and they've made sure the flames won't damage anything. 

The usual explanation is that Delta IV runs hydrogen through the engines early on. The rocket has liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen on board and they don't want excess oxygen to build up in the engines because oxygen is very chemically reactive and could damage the engine. So they run excess hydrogen through the rocket, especially early on. This hydrogen burns in a dramatic looking (but not actually very dangerous) fireball.

But then why don't other rockets set themselves on fire? The Shuttle, Ariane 5, Japan's H-II and China's Long March 5 are all using hydrogen on their first stages but don't set themselves on fire. I get that rockets using kerosene won't have the same fireball issue but why don't all hydrogen fueled rockets have a fireball? 

I feel like it's been explained a hundred times but with only half an explanation. What does Ariane 5 do differently to Delta IV that means one has a fireball and the other doesn't?

What/who (I imagine wind patterns and some engineer or AI software) decides which windmills are on? Being there are so many windmills, they’re all slightly varied angles, but there are many examples of two windmills facing the exact same direction, immediately next to each other, and one is on, one is off.

I saw a source online saying that in 100 million years it will add half an hour to a day, but I don't know how true this is.

Text: e.g. if you get something on your skin and it gives you a rash, how would your immune system even know that something was on your skin? Not to mention I'm sure there's plenty of bacteria and stuff on your skin that the immune system also should be reacting to, even in a person without allergies, right?

Text: Both Hawaii (the big island, anyway) and Iceland have significant volcanic activity, but Hawaii doesn't seem to have the level of geothermal energy availability that Iceland does.

Iceland has major percentages of its electricity and heating needs met through geothermal power. Hot springs abound, and are readily located throughout the country. 

Hawaii doesn't have any hot springs that I'm aware of. I know they've had some geothermal power plants before, but it's nowhere near as widespread as Iceland. 

What's different about these two? On the surface they seem like they should have similar features.

And the outer most bacteria are like a reddish brown so the orange comes from the yellow to red gradient.  But what does it have to do with the spectrum of light?

Text: A question came up on a test about how viruses that only infect and replicate within epithelial cells,  not dendritic cells, can be cross-presented to CD8 T cells, and I was stumped. I'm trying to search it up and I'm not getting any answers. For cross-presentation to occur to activate CD8 T cells, do these antigen-presenting cells engulf the whole epithelial cells to get access to the peptide? The question implied that the viruses wouldn't just be floating around extracellularly. I know the infected cells will have the MHC 1 for the cytotoxic T cell to kill them, but how are the T cells activated?

To me it just seems like the virus would be floating around extracellularly, but the questions was really making it seem like it wasn't. Is there anything that the dendritic cell can do with the viral genome?

Text: I was [reading about a hotel in West Virginia](https://mountaineerhotel.com/history) recently, and came across this passage.

&gt;From April 2-5, 1977, heavy rain fell in the Appalachians. The National Weather Service reports that some areas in West Virginia received **up to 15.5 inches of rain.** This massive amount of rain caused the Tug River to rise to record-setting levels and overflow. Williamson, along with The Mountaineer Hotel, was one of the flood casualties. By April 5th, **water had risen above 53 feet** in downtown Williamson. Waters had reached the mezzanine level, fully encompassing the basement and lobby, of the hotel.  

How is it possible that 15.5 inches of rainfall doesn't translate to 15.5 inches of water level rise? How does it accumulate exponentially?

And of those extinctions, do we know what percentage of these species evolved into something new and their old version died out, as opposed to the old version being wiped out in an evolutionary dead end?

**I wonder whether if when I'm on a bulk it would matter if I did put on more clothing - would that make my body use less energy to make the temperature that it's used to maintaining?** 

Wondering whether dressing in more layers could compensate for a slightly lesser caloric intake. 

**Also, conversly, would dressing in less layers help losing body weight due to increased energy expenditure?**

Text: Recently I had a strange experience. Just before dusk, I spotted a bright star in the sky for 20-30 minutes, completely still the whole time. It was the only star visible at this time, and by far. It was very bright, and appeared to be much farther out than earth's orbit. While outside, more and more satellites came into my view, until I could see at least 20 at once. As it gets darker, more stars appear, but the original bright star that was still begins to start traveling the same direction as the satellites, to the west, slightly north. It was traveling almost the exact same speed as the satellites, but would take occasional pauses in the sky for a few seconds. I did a google search of the ISS location and movement around this time. It was stated as possibly visibly during that week, but was only supposed to be visible for \~10 minutes.

My question, can the ISS stay still in the sky? For 20-30 minutes? And would it be in my view for about an hour total? Can it start and stop moving at will?

Text: On April 8, 2024, the moon will pass between the sun and the Earth, creating a total solar eclipse. The path of totality will stretch from Mexico to Maine.

It's the last total solar eclipse visible from the contiguous United States until Aug. 23, 2044. On average, any given location experiences a total solar eclipse once every 375 years.

Joel Achenbach is a science writer on the Post's National Desk. He joined the Post's Style section in 1990 after eight years at The Miami Herald. He wrote the syndicated column Why Things Are, an online-only column Rough Draft for [washingtonpost.com](http://washingtonpost.com/) and later, while working for the Sunday magazine, created the newsroom's first blog,

He is an avid storm chaser and self-proclaimed &quot;umbraphile,&quot; and has traveled thousands of miles chasing solar eclipses. Cappucci graduated in 2019 with a B.A. in atmospheric sciences at Harvard. Nowadays, he can be found roaming the Great Plains in an armored truck dodging hailstones the size of softballs while chasing after tornadoes. His second book, &quot;Extreme Weather for Kids,&quot; just came out.

Text: It seems that there was, in some locations such as Europe, a large-scale 'replacement' of native populations by Yamnaya or Indo-Europeans. The closest analogue in modern times we have is the European peopling of the Americas, with diseases like Smallpox being a huge component to the course of events. Could smallpox, itself, have been responsible? Would it have had a significant impact on urbanized centers during the Bronze age that may have contributed to the worldwide 'Bronze Age Collapse'?

Even more so now since COVID, I find the idea of how disease has impacted human culture so fascinating and underappreciated. I'd love to learn more about it.

Does that mean that the melting of sea ice/ antarctic ice/ greenland and the thawing of permafrost means a sharp rise in temperature once there’s no more to melt?

But how can this work for clinical trials for psychoactive substances like MDMA, LSD, Psilocybin etc, surely the patient can tell if they're in the placebo group simply because they're not (in the case of something like LSD) 'tripping balls'? 

I've seen videos of MDMA therapy and the patient is lying there, frankly, off their head. Surely that rules out the blindness of the trial?

Text: I started thinking about this phenomenon because of the total solar eclipse that had place on April 8, 2024 and was visible in the US and Mexico. I'm from Poland and I wanted to check when I will be able to see such an eclipse in my country but to my disappointment the next one will take place in 2135, so needless to say I won't be able to witness it. I started going through Polish Wikipedia only to discover a weird pattern - every few centuries there is one century with 4 total eclipses and then there is either one, two, or none in the other centuries. You can see the dates below:

- March 20, 1140
- September 4, 1187
- June 26, 1321
- June 16, 1406
- June 7, 1415
- June 26, 1424
- March 16, 1485
- January 24, 1544
- August 12, 1654
- September 23, 1699
- May 12, 1706
- May 13, 1733
- November 19, 1816
- July 8, 1842
- July 28, 1851
- August 19, 1887
- June 30, 1954

There were 4 total eclipses in the 15th and 19th century, one in 20th and there will be none this century. I know that it is for sure connected with the Earth rotations, but how exactly? What is the precise explanation? Does the Earth somehow position certain hemispheres differently every given time period and then this hemisphere/ region experiences more total solar eclipses? Is there a scientific name for such a position and what it is? Are there certain requirements that have to happen to experience more solar eclipses in a certain region? I'd be grateful for any kind of info.

Text: Another post reminded me that an asteroids going close the speed of light could destroy a planet. But I'm wondering if there are any phenomena that could make it go that fast? 

A explosion of a star is limited in how much it can accelerate an object. 


My guess is that the fastest we can observe an object going is falling into a black hole, but it would lose that speed when it escapes that orbit. (My knowledge of orbital mechanics is limited to what i know from Kerbal, so i might be wrong. )


Are there other ways to accelerate an asteroid or is there a natural upper speed limit to how fast we''ll ever see an asteroid go (barring aliens or being sucked into a black hole)?

Text: Currently reading “The Big Questions: The Universe” by Stuart Clark. 

When discussing the age of the universe, it is always in terms of earth years. I understand that our perception of years can change (in a long long time) due to slowing rotation, and that the revolution of the earth has been stable over the course of humanity. But that is where my confusion lies. 

How can we reliably use years to date objects that are older than the earth itself?

To reiterate, do we know that the revolution of the earth around the sun has been constant since earth formed? (I think I need this answer to be yes to not spiral 🤣)

I can’t find much on google, but if anyone can find something or share some knowledge regarding the consistency of earths revolution around the sun since it’s beginning, I thank you in advance!

Text: When I say 'energy sources' I'm thinking about, like, where we get power here on earth to do work.

I think about this sometimes: a waterwheel gets you energy directly from gravity, which is pulling the water down, which turns the wheel, etc.

Well how did the water get *up* there? Heat, basically, from the sun. And energy from the sun comes from fusion of hydrogen in its core - but that hydrogen is fusing because of gravity.

So, any energy source that traces back to the sun - solar energy, hydrocarbons, windmills - traces back to gravity.

Geothermal power on earth: ultimately traces back to the gravitational violence that brought the earth together. Nuclear power: heavy elements formed by the violent collapse of a star, thanks again to gravity.

Is this right? Like, all sources of energy available to us, they all ultimately derive from gravity? Is there any energy source we could tap into, even hypothetically, that would *not* derive in this way? Can you turn the reasoning upside down and say, in all these cases, if you look at it another way, it all comes down to electromagnetism eg? Am I thinking about this the wrong way, or am I on to something interesting?

*edit*

I'm not trying to suggest something profound like &quot;is gravity the only real force&quot;, i know better than that.. I guess I'm asking, of the energy we can extract, is it all traceable back to *work* done by gravity? So gravity has a special role, to us at least, when it comes to concentrating energy in accessible forms. The only counter-example would be artificial fusion power, right?

**edit 2**

No one is talking about **entropy**. Am I getting at the fact (it is a fact, right?) that gravity is always reducing entropy, and that by 'releasing energy' we are simply increasing the entropy again? And that the other forces don't really have this kind of effect, of reducing entropy at macro scales? (I'm just making stuff up now).

Text: I heard that asteroids or dwarf planets can sometimes get &quot;caught&quot; by larger planets and become moons. But if the intuitions of orbital mechanics I got from playing Kerbal Space Program are correct, there's no way of approaching a body such that you immediately get an orbit. You can only get a fly-by and then reduce that into an orbit by accelerating retrograde.

It also seems like it should violate time reversibility of classical physics. Imagine if an asteroid fell towards a planet with the right angle and velocity to get a stable elliptical orbit and then completes 5 laps around it. If we now suddenly and perfectly reversed its velocity, the asteroid should trace back the way it came from, right? So would it move back along the same ellipse 5 times in the opposite direction before suddenly being flung out into space, despite no other forces acting on it?

It seems to me that if orbital mechanics are time-reversible, then if they are stable forwards in time, they must also be stable backwards in time. So how can stable orbits be created through mere encounters?

In my new book, [SPACE ODDITIES](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/709405/space-oddities-by-harry-cliff/), I explore mysterious anomalies in contemporary physics and profile the men and women who have staked their careers on them. Is that data just tricking us? Is there something weird happening in the cosmos? What can help us understand questions like:

+ Why are stars flying away from us faster than we can explain?
+ Could impossible particles emerging from beneath the Antarctic ice be clues to a new subatomic world?
+ Why are fundamental particles of the universe behaving in that defy our current understanding?

Text: I understand it has something to do with efficiency and cost of manufacturing, helicopters generally only have 2, 3, or 4 blades and they're expensive. Computer fans can have upwards of 50 blades and their main purpose is to get a lot of air pushed through just as much as the helicopter. 

I guess the overall question is whay do you gain and lose as you increase the number of blades on a turbine or propellor.?

As water has a neutral PH, wouldn't the increase in ocean volume by the influx of freshwater offset the acidification caused by marine absorption of CO2?

Theoretically if you have two bags that did not stretch and they were both inflated with the minimum amount of gas required to inflate the bag at 1 ATM and 300k, assuming you compress them the same 20% of the original volume what’s going to happen to the pressure assuming that the atmospheric temp is the same? 

What about the adiabatic process vs bouyant forces would change the outcome?

I figure given that there are volcanoes on Mars and other planets/moons, this probably has been studied to some extent, and was curious if there's further reading I can follow up on?

Text: I was listening to a podcast - which admittedly isn't the most informative or &quot;correct&quot; - when the hosts started talking about climate change and potential solutions. They joked they could &quot;take the heat and move it somewhere else&quot; when one of them realized that, with the carbon better capturing the heat, we really can't get rid of it? 

The problem of climate change, from what I understand, is that the atmosphere is trapping CO2 at a higher rate. There's excess energy in an enclosed environment. If it was localized weather, I guess we could just &quot;move it away.&quot; However, this energy is *everywhere* which kinda' screws us, I assume.

Clearly, my understanding of climate change is lacking.

In a new study published on PubMed, scientists suggest that bacteria in space becomes more resistant to treatment or drugs, and are able to openly persist in the microgravity environment in abundance.

When selecting a donor, attention is paid to various HLA characteristics in order to have a 10/10 match in the best case scenario. 

Is it a coincidence that unrelated donors and recipients have the same HLA characteristics?

And the second question is probably clarified by the answer to the first question and the fact that even siblings only have a 25% chance of being suitable donors: is there a possibility of a distant relationship if some (or all?) HLA characteristics match?

Perhaps someone has an explanation for me, in detail if possible, or any websites, papers or anything else that explains this in more detail.

Text: Hi everyone. Learning about electromagnetism in physics. Not sure if I’m crazy, but do we really gloss over why a magnetic field points north to be clockwise around a current carrying wire? Do we know anything more about how or why it points clockwise other than “that’s just how it goes.”

For background, this came up when doing Oersted’s “compass experiment.” The compass sat idle pointing to earth’s north. Then current is suddenly run through the above wire and the north of the compass snaps from the earth’s north into a position *always* pointing north as clockwise relative to the direction of current (right hand rule direction).

So we know by experiment that this true. But do we know how it’s true, or is it more of a ‘brute force’ fact? It’s this *always* that gets me.

And the fact it’s so clear through such a simple experiment - compass points to the earth’s north, current is run through wire, compass snaps into north as clockwise, *always clockwise,* to the direction of convention current in wire.

Thanks all!


Tldr: Why does a magnetic field around a current-carrying wire always point clockwise, as observed in Oersted's compass experiment?

Text: I understand escape velocity is the velocity at which an object needs to be travelling to 'escape' another object's gravity, given no other forces are acting on it.

But, the range of gravity is infinite, it just falls off at the square of distance. So no matter how far away the escaping object is, it will always feel some small pull back towards the object it's escaping, even if it's infinitessimal. Therefore given enough time and obviously no other object to capture it, it will fall back even if its initial velocity was above escape velocity.

Is escape velocity an approximation given the realities of the universe (at some point the gravitational pull is so small it will be captured by another object) or have I missed something?

EDIT: Thank you for all the great answers, I understand this now. I should learn calculus.

+ I'm the first Black man and second person of color to ever lead the EPA. It's fun when things come full circle, because I started my career at the agency as an intern (don't ask me how long it's been).
+ I'm originally from Goldsboro, North Carolina and a proud graduate of NC A&amp;T. Aggie pride!
+ Like many people, my passion for the environment developed while exploring the outdoors as a kid. I would hunt and fish with my father and grandfather in rural North Carolina, and I love seeing that same spark of
curiosity in my own 10-year-old son now.
+ As a member of President Biden's cabinet, I've had the honor of traveling to 30+ states and 13 countries meeting with folks who care deeply about protecting public health and the environment.
+ Just like anyone starting a new job, I had a big list of goals in mind - tackling climate change, advancing environmental justice - but my philosophy comes down to this... I want to make sure all people have clean
air to breathe, clean water to drink, and the opportunity to lead a healthy life. It's really that simple!

We’ve had a busy few weeks at the agency – just yesterday we announced the selectees for our $7 billion dollar Solar for All program, which follows our $20 billion dollar Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund announcement from two weeks ago! We’ve also  finalized stronger pollution standards for cars and trucks, banned ongoing uses of asbestos, protected 100 million people from PFAS in drinking water, and made good on a promise to folks in Cancer Alley and overburdened communities across the nation by slashing cancer-causing pollution from chemical plants.  There’s lots to talk about, and that’s why I’m so excited to be here today... so ask me anything!

[Proof](https://twitter.com/EPAMichaelRegan/status/1782524048821408172)

PS. If anyone has tips for a good baseball pitch, I’ll also take that – I'm throwing the first pitch at the National-Dodgers game tonight and want to throw a pitch as strong as our plan to fight climate change.

Text: Back in 2020, it seemed like every scientist on the planet was working simultaneously, full steam ahead, on the Covid-19 vaccine. Thankfully, they produced one - actually, more than one. Thank you science! At the time, there was a lot of talk that there could someday be a universal vaccine that could prevent or block infection from ALL variants of Covid-19, or, even better, from all coronaviruses.

Four years later, where do we stand now? Has any progress been made on this? Are we getting closer to a universal Covid vaccine? Do scientists even care about Covid at all anymore? We never hear about Covid or vaccine research in the news anymore. Meanwhile, millions of people are still being infected with it every year, and the most vulnerable are still dying.

Text: Hello, Reddit!

We are members of Iverson Lab at Vanderbilt University, Dr. Tina Iverson and Prash Singh. We study the connection between metabolism and cell fate when organisms respond to their environments. One of our projects seeks to understand how bacteria use a nano-motor to move in response to environmental conditions. This is important because these nano-motors allow bacteria to move towards energy-rich environments for survival and hide from antibiotics during infections. Globally, bacterial infections account for 1 in 8 deaths each year. Currently, antibiotics are our best defense; however, due to factors such as antibiotic misuse/overuse, genetic mutations, and gene transfers, bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to these drugs bacteria are
becoming increasingly resistant to these drugs. There is an urgent need for alternative approaches to combat harmful bacteria.

How does a very small motor direct bacteria? Think of bacteria as tiny boats that have propellors but no rudders. This means that their propellers have to be able to guide the direction. These specialized propellors are called flagella, which resemble Indiana Jones-style whips. Depending on how the bacteria rotate the flagella, these features can both serve to move the bacteria forward and change the direction of swimming. At the base of each of the flagella is a very small and extremely efficient rotary motor that controls this direction of flagellar rotation and is the key to the entire process.

To visualize and understand the inner workings of the bacterial flagellar motor our recent research used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy. We captured and analyzed millions of pictures of these bacterial nano-motors at 100,000-fold magnification. We then combined them to reconstruct models of the different states of the motor which are shown here: https://youtu.be/sGiVNUN2ypg. Our results suggest that the motor uses interlaced cogwheels to change how the flagella rotate and guide the bacteria https://youtu.be/MsPPyNWhqPoh . We can also propose how this nano-motor can accept torque from multiple sources so that bacteria can swim at different speeds (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TLm5aoy3PM).

We are here today on Reddit to answer your questions about our findings, experiences, future directions, and more.

We will be here to take your questions from **12-1PM ET (1600-1700 UTC).** Ask us anything!

Text: If a person gets a splinter in their finger and they decide to leave the splinter in their finger the body will slowly push out the splinter itself. The body recognizes that the splinter is a foreign object and it rejects it. If someone breathes is grilling food and breathes in the smoke they will cough and wheeze. They cough and wheeze because the body recognizes the smoke is a foreign object and coughing is the body’s way of pushing the smoke out. Why doesn’t the human body reject tattoos in the same way?

Then I realized I'm not sure if any of the penguin ancestors could actually fly, or if the wings never actually had that capability. 

I know this is borderline Rule 7, but looking at evolutionary charts I'm unable to answer the question and was hoping somebody could help me.

Text: I heard it said on multiple occasions that the laws of physics would work the same even if time flowed backwards. That is to say that physics does not inherently assign a direction to time.

After any process the total entropy in the universe always increases or stays the same. How does this play into this concept? From this holistic perspective, can we say that there is a “forward” and a “backward” direction to time flow, but that this naming is arbitrary and physics makes no distinction as to which one is the “real” one? So an equivalent principle would be that total entropy always decreases, and time flows in the other direction? Or from a physics perspective is time flow in either direction indistinguishable?

Many human diseases have a genetic component. Some diseases result from a change in a single gene or even multiple genes.

If we conduct whole genome sequencing, particularly with heterozygous genes, how do we know which gene variant we are sequencing? 

Are there other methodologies for identifying gene variants (SNPs) and how these are coded in the genome? 

Presumably dominant gene variants will be sequenced but then how would we know about the recessive gene?

Why is it that of these particles, only photons are ever observed in a “free” state? Is it because the electromagnetic force has an infinite range, whereas the other two are limited to the subatomic range?

Bonus question: if the forces are unified at higher energies (i.e. electroweak), is there a different particle that would carry the unified force, or would it be both particles?

Text: In SMH of a mass on a spring, period is constant, as long as the mass and spring constant aren't changed.  The mass will return to equilibrium in a consistent amount of time regardless of the initial displacement.  However, when sound waves travel through air, the period of time it takes air molecules to return to equilibrium will depend on the frequency of the wave.  The same is true for transverse waves.  I had imagined the particles that perpetuate mechanical waves as acting like little masses on springs, but that's obviously not the whole picture.  What am I missing?

I just don't understand how that evolves over time. As I understand it (obviously flawed): Randomly over generations, one or two salamanders might happen to be born without eyes - and those ones hence conserve energy and can what, lay a few more eggs than the average &quot;eyed&quot; salamander? It's gotta be such a small percentage that happen to be born without eyes, and even then it's no guarantee that the offspring will also be eyeless. 

But practically every &quot;full time&quot; cave dweller is eyeless! And same for the skin being transparent. How do these traits come out in so many species?

Text: Hello Reddit! My name is Megan Majocha, Ph.D., and I am a research fellow in the National Institutes of Health Intramural Research Program. I conducted my Ph.D. thesis at the National Cancer Institute in the lab of Dr. Kent Hunter. Today I am here to discuss my research exploring an in-depth mechanism of a gene in estrogen receptor negative breast cancer metastasis. I am analyzing how this gene impacts metastasis and the mechanisms behind the gene that are impacting metastasis.

I completed my postbac and Ph.D. at the NIH in the same lab. Returning to the same lab for my Ph.D. was an easy decision as I find the research fascinating, and Dr. Hunter is an incredible mentor. The collaborative environment made the lab the perfect fit for my training. During my Ph.D., I have been actively involved in science communication. As a fluent user of both American Sign Language and English, communicating science
in an accessible manner is particularly important to me. Over the past few years, I wrote several articles about cancer in layman terms for OncoBites and the importance of having qualified scientific interpreters in STEM. I was also featured in a few podcasts, including NCI's Inside Cancer Careers podcast and NPR.

I am here Tuesday, May 7, from **12:00 - 2:00 pm (ET; 16-18 UT)** to answer your questions about my research and experience conducting research at NIH.

For more information about the research happening in Dr. Kent Hunter's lab, please visit: https://ccr.cancer.gov/staff-directory/kent-w-hunter

Text: Just had my first extremely disgusting experience dealing with a tapeworm infestation in my cat. The cat is dewormed and fine, but I learned that the specific type of tapeworm he caught (a Taenia species) sheds eggs that must be ingested by an intermediate host (usually rodents) where it develops into a sort of cyst that can infect cats if they eat the mouse or whatever. The vet and every source online I have found all agree that direct cat to cat infection is basically impossible, but none explain why.

My question is why does the worm need the intermediate host? The mouse and the cat are both mammals with basically the same anatomy (or so I assume as a layperson) so why would it not just go straight to the cat and skip the middle step?

Text: I am fortunate to have lived overseas in numerous countries and still live in the US.

The pattern I believe I am seeing across different countries is that, as winter gets shorter, spring remains colder for a longer period of time.

Just as a quick example, it's 55 degrees this morning in May, which I would call historically atypical for my location in the Midwest. I think this phenomenon has been growing over the past decade.

Likewise, I recall Thanksgivings of my youth featuring ground cover amounts of snow, and it hasn't been like that since my childhood. Instead,  it's more like there won't be ground cover until January...as if fall is pushing into winter, and spring is pushing into summer.

Is this discussed in climate research? Or is it just my own anecdotal evidence?

It list a single C-11 isotope as having a mass of 11,011433 u, C-12 isotope as having a mass of 12,000000 u and C-13 isotope as having a mass of 13,003354 u.

I noticed the difference in mass between C-11 and C-12 is 0,988567 u, but the difference between C-12 and C-13 is 1,003354 u.

To my (highschool level) knowledge the only difference between these isotopes is having a different amount of neutrons, which are listed in my book as having a mass of 1,008665 u. So where does this different difference of mass come from?

Edit: i’ve tried looking up the answer to my question but all the results just tell me that the difference between these isotopes is how many neutrons they have, which i already knew and doesn’t answer my question :)

Text: For example: would a baseball require less velocity than the moon to escape the Sun, all other things being equal?

Second, somewhat related question: how common is it for a collision to result in ejection from the solar system(for human scale objects and larger)? I'm arguing that ejection is rare in general and would be more likely from gravitational interactions than collisions.

Text: In chlorine neutrino detectors, whenever a neutrino interacts with one of the chlorine atoms, that one atom changes to Argon.

This is atomic number 17 gaining a proton and becoming atomic number 18.

If the neutrino is millions of times smaller than the nucleus, how does this tiny interaction actually make that atom gain a new proton?

It doesn't make much sense to me. I also wonder what other elements or compounds would make a good detector. Is chlorine just the cheapest and most abundant element we have for these kinds of detectors?

Neutrinos make zero sense to me, but I am very fascinated by them and if they have some larger purpose not yet understood.

Text: Edit: clarification and working hypothesis:

I didn't mean the southern lights, I meant the northern lights that had stretched unusually far south.

I think what's going on, and what I wasn't clear enough in my question to get at, is that 1) as lots of comments say, color varies with altitude and 2) as I failed to clarify, I think I'm south of where the aurora is actually happening.

I think I'm used to people taking pictures from inside the aurora, where they're surrounded by green. But because I'm south of it,the low altitude green is blocked by the curve of the earth, and I can only see high altitude pink.

Text: Normally we experience the opposite when using cameras: colors, say of a sunset, rarely turn out as brilliant as we experience them with the naked eye. I had two thoughts:

1) are the lights from aurorae just highly energetic, even if they're dim in the visible spectrum, so that they end up being captured better by CCDs?

2) when taking pictured at sunset, perhaps there's still enough ambient light bouncing off environmental surroundings, whereas taking pictures of the aurora, there's no ground illumination to compete with.

Text: Hello,
  

  
I've been trying to understand the nature of cancer and its origins better. From what I've learned, cancer typically begins with random mutations in our DNA that cause cells to start dividing uncontrollably and eventually form tumors. However, one aspect that puzzles me is the apparent randomness of these mutations versus the commonality of certain types of cancers among millions of people.
  

  
If the mutations are truly random, how is it that so many individuals end up developing the same types of cancer, such as breast, lung, or prostate cancer? 
  

  
I'm curious to hear your insights or if there are any recent studies that shed light on this topic. Thank you!

2 questions: did this occur after the cooling effect from the Pinatubo eruption? And also what is the reason for termination shock exactly? 

I can’t seem to find a clear explanation. My guess, from what I’ve read, is that co2 would keep accumulating but the effects wouldn’t be felt until the intervention stopped and its effects wear off. As a result it would be like jumping to much higher co2 concentrations in a very short time. So would this only be a perceived effect on living things having to adapt to a large change in a short time or is something else going on?

Thanks!

Text: I think I understand (at high level) the El Niño phenomenon: usually pacific winds blow east-to-west, and this &quot;pushes&quot; warm surface waters to the west. As a consequence, surface water is cooler in eastern Pacific than in western Pacific. When El Niño occurs, these winds weaken or reverse and the surface water gets warmer in the East (central and south America) and this of course has major consequences in these regions.

What I don't get, though, is that at a global (Earth) level, the western pacific water would get cooler during El Niño, and at this global level both effects (warning in the east and cooling in the west) would sum up to zero, hence, there would be no global effect, only local ones.

From what I hear or read, it seems that this reasoning is wrong and that there would be a global warming effect of El Niño

Am I missing or misunderstanding something ?

One might hypothesise that some kind of spatial processing ability enabled by vision is a precondition to developing echolocation. It seems somewhat reasonable, since echolocation seems a lot 'simpler', relying only on mechanical phenomena rather than the complex photochemistry and optics necessary for vision. It does seem strange that bats and dolphins are the only animals I can name which possess this ability, both of which are mammals. Are there any examples of a species which rely on similar methods as a sense?

Text: Okay I've asked this question other places before, but I've never seemed to be able to get a proper answer from first principles.

Why is there desert at places along the latitude of Mexico, Sahara, and Arabia yet India and Bangladesh are some of the wettest rainforests?

My understanding is that at approx. 30 degrees north and south of the equator, the convection of heat creates zones of low moisture. Whereas the American and Gobi deserts are caused by their distance to the sea and the presence of mountains that block moisture.

So what explains the climates of Thailand, India, and Bangladesh? They are the same latitude as the other deserts and have a similar distance to the sea as Arabia and Mexico.

Another way to ask my question: If I were to imagine a new world map with a new set of continents, what principles could I use to determine which places would be deserts or rainforests?

How do cancer cells manage to survive and multiply in such an environment?

Does it manage to hide from the immune system and multiply to a certain size which then makes it indestructible to the immune system??

Text: I’m sure we all remember the “Murder Hornet” media hype in 2020 and 2021.  That never seemed to amount to anything.  It seemed like the media was just jumping on a story they could scare people with to get more attention and make money.  But why was it that the Asian giant hornets were never able to make it in America?

Edit: I have gotten a few great answers.  The gist if it is:

1: There was a great “eradication” program.

2: They can only spread so fast, and it’s at a pace much slower than I expected.

3: They are only well suited to thrive in coastal mountain areas, which includes a large but relatively small section of the west coast.  They never had the potential to take over the US.

Text: Hi r/askscience, I was prompted to ask a question which has been bothering me for a little while now:

We all know that burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, resulting in the greenhouse effect and giving rise to climate change. But what about the other by-product, water? Release of water vapour would mean that there are (presumably) more clouds which form, more rainfall, more ground saturation, more flooding, etc. Much like carbon dioxide, water is pretty energetically stable, and is surely not being removed from the system as quickly as it is being formed. So how impactful is it's formation on our climate? Can it contribute meaningfully to rising sea levels, for instance?

However, I’ll be close to 8500 feet there, vs. 4500 here. Will it actually feel drier because of the lower atmospheric pressure? Or does the similar relative humidity level mean I won’t notice much difference?

Text: I think maybe I just can’t see the whole system in my mind, but I don’t really understand what is happening at, for example, the Hayward fault, which is inland from the plate boundary (San Andreas fault) and seems to just begin and end in the middle of nowhere, which for me is the most confusing part. But it creeps, AFAIK, along with the San Andreas. When I try to find answers to this question, all I get is plate boundary faults and explanations involving plate tectonics. The San Andreas is clearly active next to the Hayward fault (assuming the epicenter of the 1906 earthquake is correct). I assume I have an overly simplistic understanding of faults, so if someone could paint a picture for me, I’d be much obliged.

Text: The Pampas Deer (*Ozotoceros bezoarticus*) used to be one of the most common mid-sized mammals in South America, with tens of millions of them across grasslands and savannas of the continent. However, centuries of overhunting and habitat fragmentation have drastically reduced their numbers to around one hundred thousand, reducing their distribution to the Pantanal, the Cerrado and some isolated spots. Some say as much as 98% of their range has been lost. In fact, many Brazilians nowadays don't even know our country has deers, even though we have 8 species of them. The larger Marsh Deer (*Blastocerus dichotomus)* has also been impacted by the loss of its habitat, large wetlands.

However, despite fragmentating as much of its open ecosystems and deer hunting being legalized to this day, the deer populations of the United States still have millions of individuals, to the point they may cause problems due to overpopulation. How did they manage to preserve their deer numbers so efficiently? And why did the reasons not apply to Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina and other countries with vulnerable deer species?

Text: I was reviewing my public utility bill which includes my water.  I typically never review it, but out of curiosity I was looking at the breakdown of charges. I observed that I pay a $20.00 connection fee for water, but I used so little that my usage did not even equate to a penny.  The same is true of my waste water. 

It occured to me that I have no ince tive to reduce my water consumption (I live in the southwest USA which is under a water crisis).  It seems to me that if my utility removed the connection fee and increased usage fees to compensate that individual households and businesses would be more incentivised to reduce their usage to save money.  Is there any scientific research that backs up my hypothesis? I would like to share that data with my local municipality to try to push them to enact changes to help our city use less water (and potentially enable folks save money.)

Text: I remember hearing as a child that all the elements are made in stars and kind of shot out when they explode. I guess what I’m asking is how does a single atom (maybe not the right word) of an element travel and then collect somewhere? Like the nitrogen in the air or the iron in our blood. Is it just gravity?

Text: was reading about rats today and just hoping someone out there can clear this up!! 

the article was talking about how rats choose mates that are immunologically different from themselves (dissimilar MHC). the theory has been stretched to humans. for example: 1995 t-shirt sniff at uni.

my question is: isn’t every organisms MHC and immune system unique? if every organisms is different and no two are indentical then how much weight does this theory hold? is there like a quantifiable scale of difference? 
I’m meaning is there an ideal level of immunological difference? say only 10%, 20%, 30% identical? anyway just how important is MHC in mating behavior?

I do not know science at all haha out of my realm just curious. could be an awful question.

Text: Specifically your classic sugary sodas such as Coke, Pepsi, or Sprite and your typical grocery store juices like apple and grape juice.

I just got into a fairly involved debate with a person who I tried to tell that the idea that Coke etc dehydrate you is a myth and that while obviously not being as effective as water, these beverages don’t technically “dehydrate you”.  Not referring to a marathon runner, person in a desert, or anything like that.

From the time I spent researching myself it seems hard to nail down simple researched answers except regarding outlier scenarios like diabetics, excessive drinking of caffeine, etc.  Most offhand forum results and “blog” type pieces I saw agree that the idea that soda dehydrates you is a myth but I’m short on actual evidence or science.

In my state, Illinois, raccoons (and other terrestrial animals, for that matter) are \*\*VERY\*\* rarely infected with rabies, the vast majority of rabies cases are bats. 

I should say, looking up, I discovered this is, I imagine, due to rabies variants, but, my  question is, why does one rabies variant seem to so rarely affect other animals, meanwhile humans seem to easily acquire rabies from so many different species? Are we humans just especially susceptible to many more variants of rabies than other animals are? To say it a different way, why isn't it common for a raccoon in Illinois to be bitten by a rabies infect bat, then pass that rabies on to another raccoon and-so-on? Do these other animals have resistances to certain variants of rabies that humans lack?

Im just curious if atoms that have the expanded octet feature also can make bonds like this and theoretically create complex molecules with maybe even up to six other atoms. Or are those bonds much less stable or something? (And I also suppose four bonds is completely sufficient for creating complex molecules but I’m just curious)

Text: Conflicting messages in the textbooks on this one. I understand that co-operative binding occurs, resulting in each sequential O2 bound to the Hb tetramer to be easier to add than the previous. However, both the following seem plausible to me as a consequence of this phenomenon:

1. Hypothesis 1: the majority of haemoglobin exists fully-saturated oxyhemoglobin or fully-desaturated deoxyhaemoglobin, with % saturations being based on a ratio of the two. This is because oxygen will preferentially bind to haemoglobin molecules which have already overcome the relatively high energy barrier required to bind the first oxygen molecule.
2. Hypothesis 2: the % saturation represents a ratio of amount of oxygen carried by the haemoglobin and the amount that could be carried by the haemoglobin. I.e. a population of Hb molecules at 75% saturation would all contain a distribution of oxygen molecules centred on a mean of 3. Under this hypothesis, only the last (fourth) molecule tends to be loaded at the lungs and unloaded at the tissues. 

So which one is it? Both seem plausible. Both are given as explanations in (different) sources. Only the former seems to be compatible with my understanding of how a pulse oximeter works.

However, this morning with the bright sun shining through my window onto my pillow, I realised that I can tell when my eyes are in direct sunlight, even though what I'm &quot;seeing&quot; is still complete blackness. It feels uncomfortable, like looking too close to the sun does (although less intense). Closing my eyes makes very little difference. Putting my hands over my eyes makes the sensation noticeably less intense.

This leads me to wonder, am I picking up on non-visible light that is able to pass through my mask? Do my eyes have some way of detecting strong UV light that's separate from &quot;vision&quot;? If so, how does this work? Are some blind people also able to perceive direct sunlight? 

If not, what else could explain this?

Text: I know each type of cone has a wavelength of light it’s best at detecting. What I’m confused about is: is a green cone named a green cone because it’s best at detecting green wavelengths of light, or because it sends a signal to our brains that’s perceived as green? If an eye that only had green cones was shown a non-green color that falls under the spectrum of wavelengths a green cone is able to detect, would the brain perceive that color to some extent or would it only perceive green? I’ve seen people say that colors outside of red, green, and blue, such as yellow, are only perceived due to multiple cones being stimulated and the brain interpreting that as a different color, but would we be able to see yellow with only red or green cones?

Text: So I am new to mining. I don’t know if all mines use flotation but mine does (pun intended). I am wondering how the solution for flotation selectively grabs onto metal bearing minerals and leaves behind quartz and other waste rock materials. I understand some chemistry through O-chem2 but my research has yielded little results. I assume because the chemicals used are trade secrets or I don’t know the right words to use for my research on the topic. I don’t work flotation but rather in tails, so can’t really ask my coworkers as they don’t have a chem background in the least.

Text: Ok so the reason I'm asking this is more or less because like several years back an extended family friend claimed that global warming was caused not by human interference, but &quot;the sun is slowly heating up&quot;. At the time I was too stunned by the sheer gall of such a statement, and now it has dug its way up from the depths of my mind to resurface, like a barnacle on my brain. I don't know if maybe he misspoke or not, nor do I think I could have changed their mind back then (he was going down the conspiracy pipeline like it was the world's greatest slip'n'slide), but just in the one in a millionth chance I ever hear that argument again:

&quot;How much worse would it be if the sun was truly 'heating up' and causing global warming?&quot;

Like I'm assuming it would be impossible first and foremost, but in the case that global warming was caused by a gradual increase of sunrays, how &quot;over&quot; would it be for humanity? Since he said it about 4 years ago, if the sun truly was 'heating up' at a regular pace, would we not all be dead by radiation or something by this point in time? What is even the implication of &quot;the sun getting hotter&quot; other than it's about to go red giant and kill us all?

Text: I was arguing with this person on TikTok and was wondering if I am right or not. This whole debate started with me claiming that weight gain is different from weight loss, because some
People cannot physically process all of the calories they eat. This got carried away and I claimed that if you ate a pill that had 100,000 calories (please ignore that this is pretty impossible but it’s a hypothetical so the possibility of it is unrelated), you would absorb some of it, and poop out the rest of it, as you can only digest a certain amount of calories per hour, and the pill will stay in your digestive track for a certain amount of time, as it moves down at around a constant speed (I think). He says that you would die from your body trying to absorb too many calories, but I think this wouldn’t be possible as you would just poop out whatever you don’t absorb, as if you could just absorb 100,000 calories in an hour, it wouldn’t make sense as how would you have enough energy to do so. Please let me know what you think!

Text: Whether they are trying to level something like the equivalent to hanging a picture frame in space or a nondescript surface, how would they go about it?



Surely a situation where astronauts need to level something has occurred, I just can't think of an exact scenario due to lack of knowledge, nor can I find anything online. I know most levels require gravity in order to work. And then it also depends on what they truly define &quot;level&quot; as--is something level when it is perpendicular to the force of gravity and/or just parallel to another object? Could they use several gyroscopes and simulate &quot;gravity&quot; and creating something like an x and y axis?



Or is &quot;level&quot; simply not a property in space? And how do they deal with this?

Text: People can tell where a sensation is (arm vs leg vs back vs foot).

These signals travel to the spinal cord and to the brain.

How do these signals carry the location information of a sensation? For instance, is the signal that results from an electric shock to the arm different than the signal from an electric shock to the foot?

Additionally, there are a lot of other information carried to the brain as well such as pressure, texture , etc. 

Is this something science has figured out? Are there any current attempts to use ML to decode nerve signals?

If nerve signals are ever decoded, then the potential is massive. You can build devices that replicate sensations of certain things.

However, my question is if this makes creating a vaccine which produces effective preventative antibodies difficult, then how does HIV testing work?

Essentially, how can we accurately test for antibodies? Are these different in each host and with each new strain of the virus? Do the antigens on the surface of the virus change shape when it mutates as thus so do the antibodies? 

Would this make it possible that there could be a strain of HIV that is not currently detectable by standard testing, even outside of the tests window period?

Hope my question makes sense, happy to elaborate further if needed!

Hope this isn't a repeat post. So ever since studying this topic in uni i've been pretty fascinated by research surrounding the title topic ( HIV-1/O,N,P), for some reason. 

I've noticed the current literature consensus seens to be that even the rarest of these strains (groups N and P) are detected thanks to cross reactivity with groups M and O Ag included in screening assays and through sequence homogeneity when talking about viral load tests. 

What sparks my question is that i noticed some studies conducted by private companies are more restricted when predicting if current assays will continue to do so, which is why i'm interested in hearing your take on this, in case anyone has been interested/studied this particular topic!

Text: So I was on my way to the doctor, and I got to thinking. I have no specific education in medicine and biology or such, so this may be built on false assumptions:

An immunocompromised person would presumably function as a sort of incubator for whatever disease they may be infected with. So I figured that perhaps they may be more infectious to people around them.

However, I could also argue that they're more susceptible to weaker diseases that might not affect a healthy person, and so not *really* be infectious.

Or maybe my presumptions are all wrong, and they'd be just as infectious as a normal person.

The scenario is built on the presumptions that healthy people are being introduced to the immunocompromised individual, without and quarantine, as well as no other infections being introduced.

Text: Let me explain. I'm trying to understand how exactly sublingual/subbucal medications actually work. As in, how the body absorbs these medications somehow through your gums or cheeks or under your tongue. Many of these medications are prescribed with a specific time in mind before being spit out as swallowing the medication could cause stomach issues. 

But what is the actual absorption rate, and is there a direct correlation between dosage and time?

For example, if you have 100 mg of a lozenge, liquid, or troche, and you hold it in the mouth for 5 minutes to absorb; is this the same as holding 50 mg of a medication for 10 minutes?

Where is the fall off. Or is there some sort of mathematical calculation I can't seem to find online? 

Is there also a buccal/lingual limit? Will your mouth stop absorbing things at some point?

This enzyme produces sugar, but for what reason? Does the sugar produced become available for use within muscles or something? 
These sugars are the antigens that are the defining characteristics of the different blood types, so to say they can be consumed by the muscles would seem strange as that would mean that at some point those blood cells turn to O (once rinsed of their antigen by the muscle), so I'm assuming the production of these sugars is not for the purpose of fuelling the muscles. What is the specific purpose of the production of these sugars?

Text: Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Physics, Astronomy, Earth and Planetary Science**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for 'X' were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;.

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

If you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/about/sticky).

I know hot springs exist, but those only warm small areas around the pools, are there any places in the world where larger areas are warmed by the ground itself?

Text: This might be a bit of a weird question, but when we breathe, are we exaling microscopic DNA molecules into the air? Could they be &quot;picked up&quot; by somebody that is nearby?

If yes, and I understand this might be an extremelly complex scenario, if we were to touch an Item A, which has been previously handled by another person B, and then we touch the inside of our nose / nostrils, would the touch DNA from that person B then also be &quot;breathed out&quot; by us, until we &quot;run out&quot; of that person's DNA?

I know this might be very specific, but I am having a debate with my sister.

I'm curious to know what in particular was the start of all of this.

Text: I've read claims that processed foods are responsible for alot of inflammation, among other claims that they're generally awful for you.

So I looked up the definition of processed(being that it means any transformation from the food's natural state) and it seems like such a broad label that any one health claim about *all* foods in that category would stretch belief.

Now, obviously there are foods out there that are WAY more processed than other foods. Synthesizing Cheese Whiz in a lab is going to be very different from slicing a carrot and the cheese whiz is going to be way less healthy for reasons that are likely related to it being more processed but that doesnt really help my understanding.

Hope my question's clear, please let me know if I need to be more specific.

Text: Is it just marketing or semantics?  They are both administered weekly with similar doses yet insurance companies will die on the hill that you can't have ozempic if you're not type 2 diabetic. Is there something else in the drug that makes it work different? Or is it just ozempic has bigger doses? 
If there isn't a functional difference besides dose size it's like saying you can only take Advil if you have migraine but can take ibuprofen for anything else.

Title: Sonnet 21
Type: poem
Text: So is it not with me as with that muse,
 Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,
 Who heaven it self for ornament doth use,
 And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,
 Making a couplement of proud compare
 With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems:
 With April's first-born flowers and all things rare,
 That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
 O let me true in love but truly write,
 And then believe me, my love is as fair,
 As any mother's child, though not so bright
 As those gold candles fixed in heaven's air:
 Let them say more that like of hearsay well,
 I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
