Text: **Please read this entire post carefully and format your application appropriately.**

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/s93rpe/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxvi/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

Text: Hello all, I've been studying the effect of stress and trauma on the brain for over a decade, and I have studied amygdala ablation for years. The amygdala is the emotion or fear center of the brain and hyperresponsive in PTSD. Because of that, I've been very interested in the region and its role in stress and trauma. In 2020, my team and I studied two patients with epilepsy who also had PTSD characterized by heightened fear responses to things that reminded them of their trauma. Post surgery that targeted the right amygdala, both the patients no longer suffered from PTSD.

In July 2022 my work was featured in [Interesting Engineering](https://interestingengineering.com/science/brain-surgery-treat-epilepsy-ptsd-fear), and the publication has helped organize this AMA session. I'll be available at 1pm ET (17 UT). Ask me anything about PTSD, the effects of stress and trauma on the brain, and amygdala removal in PTSD.

Text: **Please read this entire post carefully and format your application appropriately.**

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/s93rpe/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxvi/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).
* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)
* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)
* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?
* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

\-------------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Text: This is a question that came out of a conversation about how transgender hormone replacement therapy for MtF people can decrease alcohol tolerance because you have less water in your body. This lead to the question of whether or not the amount of water in your system can effect how much caffeine you absorb from coffee. I looked it up and besides the mass of articles saying coffee dehydrated you, I only found one source that was kinda close which said that if you're more hydrated when you drink coffee you'll get better effects from the caffeine, and another article saying that drinking a lot of water will help flush your system of caffeine. The only remotely close article was written 6 years ago and lacks any medical sources.
I'm just a barista with a very basic understanding of how caffeine effects the body, mostly through my own experience. The somewhat contradictory information isn't very helpful and I was wondering if there was anyone who knows this stuff who could help me out.

Text: Let's say a sharp object manages to pierce its way through the skin that's behinds one's lower leg,  sinking deep into the gastrocnemius and running itself down to a few inches above the achilles heel--what would the healing process look like? 

&amp;#x200B;

* What would the wound look like before and after healing? 
* Would it ever heal to its former glory? 
* What equipment would the injured person need to use to make sure the leg heals (if there is no hospital available)? 
* Would there be scarring?   


For context: I'm currently writing a, somewhat, gory story regarding a couple of characters who are severely wounded in the muscles, leaving the skin to easily peel back- so any descriptive details would be appreciated!

Text: To my understanding the energy that goes into an appliance plugged into your wall is lost in the form of heat and light (which eventually bounces around your room enough times to also become heat).

Does this mean that any appliance that produces heat as a byproduct is equally efficient as an electric space heater?

Does this mean running a PC in a thermostat heated room is essentially free, on account of the heat from the PC meaning the space heater has to run less?

If this isn't the case, then where does the excess energy from the appliance go, if not into the room the appliance is in?

This dumb question brought to you by, me fussing about energy bills this winter! Also a bit of natural curiosity since no answer feels obvious in an intuitive sense to me.

The butterflies apparently travel great distances during these migrations but their flight seems erratic (to me) and not very efficient. This got me to thinking… do butterflies tire like mammals do? How similar or different are their flight mechanisms from animal cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems? Sorry if this is a dumb question, but I realized today that I have no idea how they work!

Text: Surplus killing is  defined as animals /predators killing more prey than is necessary. The reasoning for their behaviour is that animals can also kill for fun rather than just for survival. Is this really true or are we just anthropomorphising its behaviour?

If this is true, is it problematic since humans are mammals and the thrill for killing is programmed into us?

Title: Is it known whether acetylcholine plays a role in collagen synthesis, and do we know if anticholingeric drugs inhibit that or result in subpar tissue; is the damage only evident or just only obvious if there's already a collagen disorder at work?

Text: There’s a research paper from 2008 that says anticholinergics can greatly weaken collagen *in pathogenic lung tissue* that's found in asthmatics. Specifically: “[In human lung fibroblasts, muscarinic receptors exert stimulatory  effects on collagen synthesis. Prolonged blockade of muscarinic-induced  collagen synthesis may contribute to reported beneficial long-term effects of anticholinergics in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease](https://href.li/?https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/32/3/555.long).” The muscarinic receptors they're talking about are acetycholine receptors. Anticholinergics block those. tldr, it’s *possible* that interference from anticholinergics can make already-existent collagen weaker. 

In 2013 there’s another citing the previous paper, finding that “[human tenocytes are stimulated to proliferate by acetylcholine through an EGFR signalling pathway](https://href.li/?https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3582816/)”, which seems to mean that &quot;progenitor&quot; tendon tissue responsible for making regular tendon tissue gets instructions to do that via acetylcholine. Anticholinergic drugs block acetylcholine, so the tenocytes would get less stimulation to produce new material, so old collagen doesn’t get replaced like it should. That would make it weak, but via a different method than the previous paper. Assuming this extends to all collagen  production and not just specifically tendon tissue, this adds on to the previous evidence that acetylcholine is needed for collagen synthesis, that anticholinergic drugs can interfere with the production of collagen and, if the previous paper is added in, possibly result in weaker collagen.

Citing *that* paper, in 2016 another paper looked at the effect of knocking out an acetylcholine receptor on arthritis, which is a collagen tissue: “[Taken together, the present study shows that while M3R−/−  mice \[the ones with the deleted receptor\] were not protected from CAIA \[induced arthritis\], they had a tendency toward a higher  inflammatory response after arthritis induction than WT mice \[normal mice\]. Further,  arthritis-induced joint destruction was significantly stronger in mice  with M3R deficiency, indicating that stimulation of M3R might have  protective effects on arthritis](https://href.li/?https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4719200/).” More or less this seems to mean that when the action of acetylcholine is blocked, which is what happens when you kill the receptor (and when you block it with anticholinergic drugs), the joint tissue is worse off and more inflamed. Thus acetlycholine appears to be necessary for healthy tissue, and without it the tissue is worse.

In healthy people an anticholinergic drug may not cause any noticeable problems, but in people with collagen disorders who have a preexisting synthesis and weakness issue, it could drastically compound the existing problems, or even incite symptoms that didn’t previously exist. As far as I’m aware, we don’t actually know the mechanism of why collagen is weaker in any collagen disorders; it’s possible that acetylcholine differences could be a reason, and if they are, then drugs that block the action of that would naturally make the problem worse. 

**Does anyone know if this is indeed an established thing, that healthy collagen does require acetylcholine and that anticholinergics cause weaker tissue?**

But if an invertebrate suffers a break in their exoskeleton, does it seal the way our skin can? Or does everything leak out? For segmented species, are the segments sealed off from each other to prevent that? 

Since they have no skin with sensing nerves, do they register pain the same way we do? Do they bruise? Can they suffer the equivalent of sprained or torn muscles or ligaments, and can they heal from that? If so, how?

(I promise this is research for a book, I'm not some weird insert sadist.)

Text: I was thinking about how the vast majority of plants rely on endosymbiotic fungi (mycorrhyzae) but it seems like most animal-fungi relationships are strictly predatory/parasitic (eg: cordyceps, yeast infections, athlete's foot). I've heard off-hand mention of fungi in our guts being native to that ecosystem, but I can't find anything describing them as beneficial besides &quot;promoting immune system development&quot;. Yeah, that would technically be beneficial, but it's nowhere near as important as mycorrhyzae or other cross-kingdom relationships like coral and algae, spotted salamanders and their algae, and the tons of bacterial-animal relationships.

TLDR: Are fungi and animals just not compatible or did I miss an example? If they aren't compatible, why are fungi cool with plants?

PS: I'm specifically asking about fungi living in/on animals in a literally inseperable relationship. Farmed fungi, like those associated with leaf cutter ants, or fungi that use animals animals as spore dispersers, such as stinkhorns, don't count.

Text: I have an informational calendar that for the month of October reads: &quot;Insects are an ancient group of organisms: they first evolved around 450 million years ago.&quot;

I feel like I see this phrasing a lot, where some organism is described as having evolved circa a specific time in the past. But evolution isn't an event, it's a process that's constantly ongoing, and I've always felt this kind of wording implies, in this example, &quot;and then suddenly there were insects&quot;. 

Would it be more appropriate to say that this is the time period for which we have the oldest evidence of the existence of what most people would recognize as an insect? Is it a period of unusually rapid change where the ancestors of insects began to acquire features that we consider insects to have, like exoskeletons, multiple limbs, antennae, whatever? Or something else entirely?

And, related, if any science educators or evolutionary biologists find themselves weighing in here, are there better ways to convey this information? Evolution is a very complex topic that's by no mean easy to reduce to packets of digestible knowledge, but in the interest of scientific literacy it feels like this kind of phrasing does a disservice to what the concept of evolution attempts to describe.

The book says he discovered this because when he put a mouse on a little stand (so he wouldn't drown) inside a bowl of water, and then covered the mouse and stand with a jar, the water inside the jar rose up above the water outside the jar (I assume they are implying it rose to compensate for the oxygen being used up).

But I would think the CO2 would replace the O2 and there wouldn't be a vacuum situation. 

It is in my Exploring Pearson Textbook for year 8.

&quot;Could the human eye have arisen directly from something slightly different from itself, something that we may call X?

If the answer to this question for any particular degree of difference is no, all we have to do is repeat the question for a smaller degree of difference. Carry on doing this until we find a degree of difference sufficiently small to give us a ‘yes’ answer.&quot;

My doubt is simply: if this degree of difference becomes so insignificantly small, could natural selection still &quot;distinguish&quot; between such minimal fitness in order to select for it?

Or is it that, on average, even such a small degree of difference is enough to propagate over time through natural selection, provided there is at least a minimal increase in fitness?

Text: In the recent speculation of Credit Suisse, I see allot of Experts say while they might be having a rough patch they aren’t coming close to solvency. The little I understand is that certain derivates seem incredibly difficult to value and can rapidly change and nuke Banks since it’s based on the underlying value of other instruments. Which themselves might of been poorly conceived and poorly put together. 

Certain financial instruments themselves seem to make markets act highly irrational and can make the true Value of companies and banks next to impossible to know in certain instances.

Text: I am currently reading &quot;What happened to you&quot;, and in it Dr. Perry repeatedly states the fact that negative experiences within the first two months of childhood have a more significant impact on a child than ones in the next twelve years.

He goes on to state that children who have had a bad experience in the first two months and then only positive experiences for the next 12 years have worse outcomes than children in the opposite situation.

This struck me as something that would be really hard to test. How many children are really out there that bad experiences only for the first two months of their lives? How were we able to know they had bad experiences then when the children were unable to recall what happened to them?

For most two month olds isn't virtually every experience a negative one? Everything is new and scary when experienced for the first time, how would you be able to tell which/how many experiences were and were not traumatic for the child?

As an example, if a study was aiming to see reactions to sounds/images of people in pain, would they be allowed to say to a subject that what they were seeing is real and only reveal later that the images/sounds/videos were faked?

Text: Hi Reddit! We are Simone Li (/u/simone_s_li), Sebastian Schmidt (/u/TSBSchm), Nicolai Karcher (/u/YummyYam123) and Daniel Podlesny (/u/DanielPodlesny). We are lead authors on three independent, recently published studies on microbiome dynamics following fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT, aka stool transplants). Ask Us Anything!

An FMT is the transfer of stool from a donor to a recipient, usually to improve the recipient's health. FMTs are an increasingly popular intervention in different diseases, ranging from recurrent infection with C. difficile (where clinical success rates are &gt;90%) all the way to autism. Yet while FMTs seem to &quot;work&quot; well in some people and diseases, clinical effects are meagre in others and the reasons for this remain very incompletely understood. For a broader introduction to FMT, check out wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_microbiota_transplant.

As FMT targets the gut microbiome, it is generally thought that clinical success depends on the successful engraftment of &quot;good&quot; microbes from the donor and decolonization of &quot;bad&quot; microbes from the recipient. However, what really happens to the microbiome following an FMT, and whether outcomes can be predicted in advance (for example, to pick suitable donors for every recipient) has remained unclear. We represent three independent research teams who tackled this problem by analysing data from several independent trials where FMTs were conducted for different diseases: we used metagenomic data (i.e. DNA sequences directly from stool samples) to track microbes between donors and recipients. We developed models to predict whether donor microbes would colonize or recipient microbes persist after the intervention, and we used this information to pinpoint the factors that determine these outcomes. Broadly speaking, all three teams made similar observations: microbiome dynamics after FMT were somewhat predictable, and there is a limited list of factors that drive outcomes - most of them are on the recipient's side, meaning that choice of a &quot;matching&quot; donor seems less relevant than previously thought.

These kinds of tests have been happening for decades so I imagine we are seeing some kind of long term impacts because of them.

Text: This is a question I've been thinking about for a few months but never really knew who to ask so I'm wondering if this is the right place! 

Obviously aeroplanes are really noisy, and after I've (and im sure everyone else) has been on a flight then for short period of time afterwards my ears feel blocked, my hearing is decreased and i overall feel a bit groggy. It's the same after ive been to any loud event like concerts or whatever. 

On my last few flights ive worn my earbuds which have a noise cancelling feature. i (think) i understand the basic science behind this feature, that the earbuds record whats going on around me and inverts the wavelength then plays it back to me, cancelling out the noise entirely. after this, my ears dont feel blocked at all after a flight 

how is this? i understand i cant actually hear the loud aeroplane noises, but surely the loud wavelengths are still entering my eardrums even if my brains being tricked into thinking theyr not. so does this mean the deafening isnt a result of the actual wavelengths or physics, but is instead neurological cause my brains been too used to loud noises for a period of time and cant understand quiet ones for a bit? i dont understand this at all but its been puzzling me so id love if anyone has an explanation

Even in subsonic conditions, a flame can get blown out at high gas speed (I am not sure why). My brain hurts...

Text: This might be a bit of a weird question, but hopefully you can bear with me. From what I understand, AI image generators are based off of training a neural network on a whole bunch of images and then being able to recall bits of them and combine them into new images. This is supposed to be analogous to how our neurons work and how our imagination would draw from our memories to create new images.

So one thing I noticed was that it is easy to imagine an image, say an image of the letter A. It is also very easy to imagine it rotated 90 degrees so that it is sideways. However, it seems to me that AI image generators probably can't produce rotated versions of their memories. From what I understand the images are remembered all in specific orientations relative to each other, and so unless it was fed pictures of sideways A's there wouldn't be any way for it to derive rotated A's from images of upright A's.

I tried putting things like &quot;sideways letter A&quot;, &quot;rotated letter A&quot;, and &quot;letter A on its side&quot; in Dall-E, but it always only ever turned out A's the right way up. The closest I could get was &quot;tree on its side&quot;, but that just made pictures of trees that had fallen over, not making a rotated picture out of an upright memory. I don't think there we need to have seen pictures of a sideways A or tree to imagine it.

Obviously our brain can recognize the edges between objects and some more advanced stuff, which I'd guess are also possible for neural networks if they were designed for it, but the only possibility for rotating images that I'm aware of is using abstract math. From what I understand, rotating an object is something that involves things like complex numbers, vectors, or linear algebra, so not the simplest kinds of math. I guess I have a hard time understanding how our brain could be doing math like that without us consciously being aware of it, or how something like that could evolve in the first place. It seems like you would need a pretty specific arrangement of neurons to act like logic gates to do more advanced math, which I don't think neural networks are capable of. If there is math like this going on, where is it happening?

There's probably a very obvious answer to this question, but I appreciate people humoring me.

Text: I was reading about the strong force and color confinement recently, but everything I read seemed to only talk about an isolated nucleon.  

A brief reading of the Nuclear Force (the binding force between nucleons) which can be viewed as a &quot;residual strong force&quot; indicates it is mediated by virtual mesons.  To my completely uneducated mind, that reads as though the nuclear force is almost like nucleons swapping quarks between one another (as a meson is a quark-antiquark pair). 

I'm assuming I'm reading too much into it and letting my uninformed imagination run a bit too wild.  Because my loose understanding of virtual particles is that they're just a byproduct of random fluctuations in the quantum fields.  But then that makes me think that maybe it doesn't make sense to say that a nucleon has &quot;ownership&quot; over its quarks at all, if its quarks can't really be distinguished.  Which only furthers my question of if each nucleon is clearly a separate entity while in a nucleus or not.

Text: Was there anything special about how NASA designed DART to get the most efficient energy transfer when crashing into Dimorphos? For example, if they put more mass in the front (impacting side) of the spacecraft then I would assume it would transfer more energy into the asteroid. This is because there would be less absorption of energy as it crunches during the impact. But if they put more mass in the rear side then they would lose some energy as it accordions before the rear comes into contact.

Or does this even makes sense to take into consideration because of how fast DART was flying/it being just a proof of concept?

Text: Information in metamorphic rocks

Hi guys. Italian science teacher here. I'm about to have classes on geology and with my biology background sometimes i find it difficult to craft a whole lesson out of the basic things i know. But let my cut to the chase.

I am trying to talk about rocks in terms of what information geologists can sqeeze out of them, then try to use that information as an opener for explaining cool stuff like tectonics and such. For example i showed igneous rocks and their connection with paleomagnetism (so that i can take that thing for granted when we will discuss the midatlantic ridge), and i talked about sedimentary rocks in terms of stratigraphy (that will come in handy often later on).

Now... what about metamorphic rocks? I just know that they lose information on fossils at the microscopic level, or i could point out that scists (not sure if i spelled it correctly in english) have an orientation dependent on the direction of the force that generated them, but this seems just details to me.

Do you have a bigger idea to throw at me? Thanks in advance (and sorry if my grammar and/or geology aren't sound)

Ciao!

Text: 
The question is how can some viruses that aren’t chronic take so long time (Years) for the body to fight off? 

So Virus generally to my understanding are just blindly trying to multiply. Our immune defense is trying to stop this. 
In normal sickness the virus multiplies but after a short while be it a few days or weeks the body’s defense turns the tide and the virus is defeated. The other extreme is the virus goes rampant and then kills the victim as the defenses failed to hold back the virus. 
I understand in chronic cases the virus is able to go dormant and hide to avoid the immune defence to at times wake up and cause a new outbreak. But the outbreaks gets defeated just so the dormant virus isn’t found and exterminated. 
But there are viruses that lasts for a long time where the virus still gets defeated permanently. How come it takes so long time yet never the virus takes totally over or the immune defense does? Is it a long time of “stalemate” where the replication of virus is about as large as the immune defence can keep up killing it, causing a “stable” state. Take HPV warts for example. They have strains that aren’t “permanent” but can take years before fought off. 

Is some of my understanding wrong or how come it take so long? What happens after years that suddenly tips the tide? And how come if it isn’t defeated before then it doesn’t spread more? Like I’m case of HPV to all skin cells?

Text: How can ionizing radiation stick to things? Radiation is not matter. It is invisible, you cannot &quot;touch&quot; it or hold it. And yet, apparently you CAN wash it off, at least to a certain degree. What gives?

Stranger still, is the fact that objects which have been contaminated, somehow &quot;lose&quot; radiation stuck to them over time! Yes, I read somewhere about half-life of elements and whatnot, but what does a half-life of uranium-238 for example, have to do with the radiation that it gave off which in turn stuck to something? Radiation is not the element itself, it is energy, so how can it &quot;decay&quot; like the element that originated it?

I watched the series Dopesick about the opiod crisis in America, and miners were given opiods for severe mining related injuries. Couldn't these all be treated by NSAIDs then?

I was wondering because I ended up fasting for close to 14 hrs before having blood work done (I was stranded on a broken-down metro car for 2 hours trying to  get to the clinic, heh). A lot of my values were in the normal range but borderline. I was wondering if the extra-long fasting time could have affected things, and if it’s likely the values would have been outside of the normal range if I had fasted for the usual amount of time. Like, if the values drop at a rate of X units/hr, perhaps letting it go for a couple of extra hours could have falsely pushed them down into the normal range….? Is there any data looking at that kind of thing? Or is it generally assumed not to matter too much?

Text: I've been thinking about this for awhile but I couldn't find many resources about it online. My reasoning is: every human has certain dimensions/proportions (let's say an IPD of 63-66mm); some of them are in the &quot;ideal&quot; range, whereas others are under (IPD=60mm) or over (IPD=71mm) it. However, if we took the average of all humans for each feature, the people who are over and people who are under would cancel out and the end result for average human (or maybe average male and average female separately) would fit all the ideal metrics. This is kind of similar reasoning to &quot;Wisdom of the Crowd&quot; (see: [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom\_of\_the\_crowd](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd)) phenomenon, but rather than a crowd's intellect, it's a crowd's (species') physical attractiveness.

One resource I did manage to find was this:

[https://www.artfido.com/this-is-what-the-average-person-looks-like-in-each-country/](https://www.artfido.com/this-is-what-the-average-person-looks-like-in-each-country/)

This is very nearly what I am going for, just couldn't find one for the entire earth. I am also not sure how accurate that website is. But, assuming it is accurate, you'll notice all the faces (male &amp; female) are all very good looking and far more attractive than what you'd probably consider &quot;average&quot;. This is a result of the &quot;cancelling of error&quot; that I mentioned above.

So heres the hypothetical scenario. We have two refrigerator sized prisms standing side by side and the water level is steadily rising. Object A has a big lead weight sitting inside, at the bottom, while object B has the same lead weight, but it is located towards the top of the object. The weight and volume of the two objects is otherwise identical. The two objects are mostly hollow and can float in water. As the water level rises, at some point these objects begin to lift off the ground. Will one lift off the ground before the other, or will they both lift off the ground at the same time?

Is there any theoretical way of measuring these objects through different means which do not subject the particles to such forces?

Or is their state inextricably linked to an observer's knowledge about them?

Text: Some people say that AB is the most recent and didn’t occur until the 16th Century when group A populations from Europe and group B populations from Asia began to mix. 

However, it is known that gibbons and humans both have variants for both A and B blood types, and those variants come from a common ancestor that lived 20 million years ago. Then doesn't it mean blood type AB existed at least before 16th century, while AB is just a mixture of A and B?

Which one is correct? What is the scholars' mainstream opinion about it now?

Text: It seems every week a news article appears discussing the results of yet another study detecting per- and poly-fluoroalkyl (PFAs) somewhere or in something. For example, PFAs have been detected in pesticides, food, clothing, cleaning products, drinking water, breast milk, rain, on Mount Everest, umbilical cord blood, and the list goes on. If PFAs have been around since the 1940s and are seemingly omnipresent, meaning we all have been constantly exposed to them for years at varying levels, how bad can they actually be to human health and what can be done to avoid them?

Because of the relationship of objects in a gravity well aren't we moving the Sun and potentially destabilizing that too, however an insignificant amount? Could many years of spaceships launching from the same place on Earth at the same time of year/day/force angle cause it to lose its stable orbit? Eventually?

I'm aware these are irrational fears I would just like someone very smart to tell me why LMAO

Text: Might be a bit silly or dumb question, but I always wondered about this.
So I know that soundwaves from different sources can influence each others in various ways and I was wondering if that goes electromagnetic waves too, as both are &quot;waves&quot;... 
Moreover, it would also interest me in how much the overall behaviour of both can be compared at all? Are both perfect congruent eqivalents that can be used to make assumptions of the behaviour of each others, or do the have only some few vague shared traits in terms of that and are fundamentally different aside from that?
Or is it more something inbetween?

Text: I thought of this while telling my dog she wouldn’t even know what to do with a piece of molten hot potato that she was begging for.

I remember reading before that the advent of cooking was an inflection point in our evolution, and that we had evolved some traits (e.g. smaller teeth and jaws) likely in response to the change in diet once our food started to come cooked. It got me thinking: if cooked food placed enough evolutionary pressure for “cost-saving” traits like our less beefy chewing muscles, could it have been enough to push something like better responses to thermal burns in order to minimize losing access to food. Surely the risk of being unable to eat is enough of a driver for some change, and the burning risk that comes from a piece of meat fresh out of the fire would be a new environmental aspect that we hadn’t had to deal with before. If enough time has passed that we’ve since been able to evolve other known traits, it seems possible that an improved healing mechanism could also be present compared to other species.

Text: So current genetic testing of IVF embryos is to get the egg and sperm together, make a bunch of embryos, wait a few days to see which ones grow and then to pop them open, scrape out a bunch of cells and then send them to the lab. The lab then tests those cells for any abnormalities (aneuploidy, etc) while the embryos get frozen. Once results are back the cleared embryos can be implanted one at a time until one takes.

So there has been some research on childhood cancer risk of frozen embryos and that seems to be a bit elevated relative to standard - 1.6-1.7 times.

https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1004078

This is still a fairly new process and we don’t know if there are any impacts later in life from freezing, it’s an open question as frozen embryo children hit middle age. Fingers crossed.

My question was on the genetic testing side. If you have an embryo and pop it open and remove a bunch of the very first cells, then the remaining cells step up and still deliver a baby. That is established. What impacts might arise from the cell removal process though? Like if you were going to have 100 cells at that point and are now down to 90 or whatever then would that have any impacts later in life? The remaining cells need to divide more I guess. Thoughts?

Text: Hello /r/AskScience! Dinosaur mummies preserve skin and other soft tissues, but how they fossilize has always been a bit of a quandry. It's generally thought that very rapid burial is required to protect remains from predators, scavengers, and other agents of decomposition. However, they often also appear desiccated, which usually takes long-term exposure on the landscape.

Recent preparation on the Edmontosaurus mummy &quot;Dakota&quot; revealed the first evidence of predator activity on dinosaurian soft tissues and provided an alternate explanation for how these rare fossils form. You can read [our recent publication](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0275240) in PLOS One.

Text: A while ago I noticed how the color of objects gets progressively darker the dimmer the light source is, up until everything looking completely black if there's none, at least to our eyes. And then i also realized this happens the same the other way around, as if the light source is bright enough, it can make objects look completely white.   


And this effect is a spectrum, you can make an object go from black to white by going from no light source to a really strong one. So then, how can we really determine the *true* color of things? or if there even is one? a &quot;red&quot; jacket can go from a bordeaux color in dim light to a more crimson tone in brighter light, what color is the jacket, objectively?

I understand that in the case of zebras who are fast and travel in large herds of almost 1000 individuals, I see their camouflage patterns work well. 

Unlike zebras, giraffe bodies taper towards their necks, it's not hard to count and target a giraffe, even when they travel in a herd. And this herd size is around just 20 animals. 

Are these spots really for camouflage coz I don't see it working.

Text: I have a couple of questions about vaccines inspired by the ongoing pandemic:

1. With endemic viruses, whether it be covid-19 or influenza, that we are more or less perpetually “chasing” because they mutate too quickly for vaccines to keep up, would it make sense to use predictive modeling to determine what mutations would most likely be present, say, a year from now, and engineer vaccines based on those predictions? So by using a vaccine that is essentially a cocktail of current and predicted strains, perhaps we could catch up to the virus?

2. Somewhat in line with the first question, how -valent can a vaccine be? I have seen up to 13-valent vaccines just from a cursory Google search, but what is the limit on the number of strains one vaccine could have, and what about the human immune system limits that number?

Text: I just discovered on Wikipedia that, contrary to my intuition, deer, moose, giraffes, camels, and sheep are all only very distantly related to horses. The former are all Artiodactyla while horses are Perissodactyla. This is rather strange to me because they look very similar and certainly more similar than a moose and an orca do (apparently orcas are also Artiodactyla). How is it possible that orcas and moose are more related than horses and moose?

Edit: For clarification, I understand how phylogeny works based on shared ancestry, not morphology. What I am more interested in is any more in-depth background on how the decision was made to classify ungulates based on toe parity, and perhaps anything on how exactly orcas fit into this.

Text: I haven’t been able to find a clear on answer on Google, and it’s a little frustrating. 

I noticed that these salmonella types have specific diseases associated with them, typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever. Why do these get special designation, while the other salmonella types are simply salmonellosis? 

Thanks for any answers!

Text: Taking bananas as an example, a freckled banana tastes significantly sweeter than a green one. I assume there’s an actual higher sugar content in a more ripe banana? Does this change the nutritional profile of the banana in any significant way? Or does it still fall into the general range of “bananas have about this much sugar?”

Are there other less obvious ways that the nutritional content of fruits (or vegetables) change at various stages of ripeness?

Text: As far as I know, cancer appears when random cells in your body mutate and refuse to die, then multiplying into other cancerous cells, and so on until they invade the nearby tissues.

Any damage to cells may increase the risk of cancer because with every cell division, there is a risk of an error that can give birth to a cancerous cells. More division, greater chances of errors.

Giving blood depletes the body of a insane amount of cells, cells that need to be replaced by the body via division. Does this increase the risk of a error occuring during the division that could give birth to a cancerous cell?

EDIT:  I saw a reply in my email that doesn't seem to appear here.  Someone mentioned that it could be dangerous to drink a liquid that was below the freezing point of water because it could cause body parts to freeze.  I am looking for a modest decrease in freezing point, around 10-20F below the normal freezing point which shouldn't be much more dangerous than drinking an alcoholic drink that's below 32F or chewing ice.

The purpose of this inquiry is to make a sports drink that could be kept liquid below 32F

One of the sources I'm considering is contaminated agar, as the rhizomorphic mycelium I use now started from a culture that had contamination in one area.

From what I've read, it looks like this bacterium spreads via wet surfaces by swimming, or the spores fly through the air. I also suspect contamination through the air, as the innoculation wasn't in a flow hood.

Is it possible that B. Subtilis can dig into and embed itself in solidifed agar, or is it more likely that the airborne spores got into my grains?

This should, as I understand it, happen with literally every single wireless signal in a given area, creating a giant jumbled mess that would end up giving noone any of the things they were using their wireless signal for. Am I fundamentally misunderstanding something here? I am genuinely confused.

Text: Let me lead off by saying I *am* aware of the equation for this. I'm confused by some of the details. I've been trying to learn a thing or two about rocket engines and I'm struggling to pick apart this particular question.

So in the combustion chamber you've got an initial temperature and pressure (etc.) which are basically a function of the reactants you are using. These determine the area of the throat, which is sized so that you get sonic flow at that choke point. You need the A\* that gives M=1 at the throat.

But I'm confused about what determines the shape and size of the nozzle after that... Here's a few things I do understand:

* The propellant shifts to supersonic after the throat. Velocity increases as the area expands.
* Temperature and pressure drop as velocity increases.
* Ideally, you want the pressure at exit to be equal to ambient pressure. (This is mainly about efficiency?)
* The exact shape (and length?) isn't super important. It's mostly just about weight and cost.

I guess it's that third point is perhaps what has me confused. When I look at the equation for thrust, there's two terms:

1. mass flow rate \* exit velocity
2. exit area \* pressure difference from ambient

Let me assume a fixed mass flow rate. The equation for exit velocity is... basically a function of exit pressure. The other terms are basically all coming directly from your choice of fuel/oxidizer and other initial conditions. The exact term where it appears is `1-Pe/P0` so I think what that's saying is the &quot;ideal&quot; is zero exit pressure? The higher your exist pressure is to the initial pressure at combustion, the less energy you've gotten out of it. And lower exit pressure ultimately requires a larger nozzle exist area.

But then if the exit pressure is too low you start to suffer from the second term. Because if exit pressure is lower than ambient this term goes negative.

Am I right in understanding that this is the tricky balance you need to strike? And shooting for Pe=Pa is where it happens to be optimized for thrust?

Text: It is even obvious to know that, in the world of biology, to perform a movement or anything needs energy. I believe the most famous molecule that provides such energy is ATP. But here I run into a problem: viruses have no metabolism, and are acellular. They basically &quot;float&quot; until they find a host. But they find and, in the case of the bacteriophage, its structure resembles a robot, but where does it get the energy to carry out the movement of injection of genetic material inside the bacterium??

Text: For simplicity's sake let's say a planet is Earth-sized and has the same orbital period. Could there be a comet that feasibly comes around once a year at the same date? What might the mechanics of this look like, and possibly how long (i.e. how many years? centuries?) before you'd expect the subtle shifts in its orbit to eventually deviate enough from this path to be noticeable?

There could be some slight room for error as I'm imagining a culture that doesn't have telescope or satellite technology as yet, but I'm interested to hear any broad responses the question brings out. Thanks!

p.s. if this is something that happens on Earth already I didn't find it on google so pls be kind lol

Text: I recently watched a YouTube video where they painted a car in Musou black paint. These paints are known as the blackest paint in existence since they can they only reflect ~0.0005% of incoming radiation (including light, microwaves and radio waves). Considering this, it got me wondering if a vehicle painted these colors would be significantly more difficult for police speed guns to register a reflection (laser light or radar) and report an accurate speed? Or would the license plate and windows reflect enough to get a reading?

Text: I recently purchased a soundbar, and I've noticed that my cat now doesn't want to enter the living room whenever the soundbar is on and receiving audio from any source — even if the soundbar itself is muted and so silent to my own hearing.

After eliminating other possibilities, I'm left with the hypothesis that my soundbar is producing some annoying or frightening noise in some ultrasonic frequency — a frequency that I can't hear, but my cat can. (I'd like to find out for sure, but ultrasound microphones are apparently expensive, and I'm not sure how to capture the audio coming from one.)

Do many electronic or mechanical devices produce incidental operational vibrations at ultrasonic frequencies? If we could hear these higher frequencies, would our constructed environments — cities especially — seem especially &quot;noisy&quot; in these frequencies? Are there any product standards or government regulations intended to limit ultrasonic &quot;noise pollution&quot;?

If so, is or could there be anything done to know in advance someone is at risk for this injury or restore/repair their ligament.  

If not what would make the one time a person hurt their ACL while running, which didn't look particularly violent, different than any other that didn't cause the injury?

Text: I am [Doctor Mark Horowitz](https://markhorowitz.org/) MBBS PhD, and I am a psychiatric researcher in the National Health Service in England, an honorary researcher at University College London and training psychiatrist. My research has been concerned with how to safely stop psychiatric medications based on understanding their effects on the brain - and the technique I have developed, called [hyperbolic tapering](https://www.thelancet.com/article/S2215-0366(19)30032-X/fulltext), has been adopted as [guidance](https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mental-health/treatments-and-wellbeing/stopping-antidepressants) for the public by the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the UK. This research came out of my own awful experience coming off antidepressants. I run a clinic in the public health service in London to help people safely stop psychiatric drugs for anxiety and depression and find that many people who could not stop their medication in the 'old-fashioned' ways are able to do so safely in my clinic, now supported by studies using similar techniques.

I am also a co-author of the recent umbrella review assessing the validity of the serotonin hypothesis ('chemical imbalance') in depression, published in [Molecular Psychiatry](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01661-0). While many psychiatrists say this is old news, research suggests that over 80% of the public still believe in the chemical imbalance theory, and many companies and healthcare bodies still promote it on their websites.

In North America, I have co-founded a company called [Outro Health](https://www.outro.health/), which brings this gradual, supported and hyperbolic approach to people in Canada and the US, so that people will have the support they need (and which I did not have!). I will be on at 12pm US EST (16 UT) for 3 hours. AMA!

Text: There have been recents posts on the disinterest American males have on having children in /r/science (among other places). Conversely, I was just reading about the difficulties in policing child labor in Bangladesh.

We know that, generally speaking, as a country becomes more affluent, birth rates decline. So it made me wonder how much economic factors are playing a role in birth rates globally.

An often cited reason for people to not want children in the United States is that they are expensive and that they don't think that raising children would make them happy.

Intuitively, it seems to me that those in extreme poverty could be having children potentially due to the fact that they will provide income to the parents and the closest thing the parents can get to a retirement plan. But is that true? Are economics (or personal finance, I suppose you could say) really a major motivating factor in the choice to have children worldwide?

Text: Hello,

I would like to start off by saying I know this is a dumb question, but I cannot find the answer anywhere else on the internet, and I would really appreciate some help. I basically don't understand the statement, &quot;*when sufficient energy is crammed into a sufficiently small space, particles that were not previously present can sometimes be created out of that energy.&quot;* This quote is from this article:

[**https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/particle-physics-why-do-it-and-why-do-it-that-way/**](https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/particle-physics-why-do-it-and-why-do-it-that-way/)

The article is from a website, Of Particular Significance, by Matt Strassler. Really cool website for those particle physics geeks out there, and can accomodate all knowledge levels. I posted a comment last June, but since I have still received no response (*ahem* Matt), I have taken matters into my own hands. Below is the original comment, commented under Vector Hugo.

So, this sentence really confused me at first, “It is a remarkable property of nature that when sufficient energy is crammed into a sufficiently small space, particles that were not previously present can sometimes be created out of that energy.” I was sitting here with minimal scientific background, and I’m just like, ‘Did the Law of Conservation of Mass AND the Law of Conservation of Energy just go out the window?!!’ Anyways, after reading the comments, I grew a better understanding and addition to more questions. Am I interpreting this the right way? Why are these laws still taught in schools? More importantly: HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE???thank you

I'd like to thank anyone that took the time to respond or to just read some responses. Any comments/further questions are appreciated!!

Text: I'm a nursing student, and I'm currently studying my second physiology unit. My materials all say that when a blood vessel is damaged, vasoconstriction occurs to reduce the pressure and flow of blood, so that the platelet plug is not dislodged. This mostly makes sense to me, however it's my understanding that vasoconstriction means the same amount of blood flows through a smaller opening, thereby INCREASING blood pressure. Is there a different mechanism in place during haemostasis? Is the constriction occurring proximally to the clot, reducing the volume of blood? Is the heart output of blood changed? I can see the heart rate increasing in major injuries, thus lowering blood pressure, but what about for minor injuries?

Text: Say Juliet wins two state lotteries back to back in 1999.

A person who thinks it was rigged might say &quot;Well, the probability of her winning two state lotteries back to back is infinitesimally low. Therefore she probably rigged it.&quot;

A person who looks at the broader scope of lotteries might say &quot;Well, the probability of someone winning two state lotteries at some time is much higher. This is explainable by chance and the lottery being rigged isn't necessary.&quot;

The second is a logically weaker description of the first. It &quot;seems&quot; more correct, but is it? What is the justification for it? Many would say that the second description seems more relevant, but why? Why is it exactly more relevant?

Curiously, one can construct logically stronger and logically weaker versions of the same exact sequence of events, and yet...each would have wildly different probabilities. For example, these descriptions go from logically strong to logically weak:

1. What is the probability that Juliet decided to play two New Jersey state lotteries, won two state lotteries, and won it at 9 PM? (assuming it was announced then)
2. What is the probability that Juliet won two New Jersey state lotteries?
3. What is the probability that Juliet won two state lotteries?
4. What is the probability that someone won two state lotteries?
5. What is the probability that someone won two lotteries?
6. What is the probability that some rare meaningful event in the world occurs?
7. What is the probability that an event occurs?

Text: According to a Wikipedia article on tropical rainforests climates, &quot;When tropical rainforest climates are more dominated by the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) than the trade winds (and with no or rare cyclones), so usually located near the equator, they are also called equatorial climates. Otherwise, when they are more dominated by the trade winds than the ITCZ, they are called tropical trade-wind climates. In pure equatorial climates, the atmospheric pressure is almost constantly low so the horizontal pressure gradient is low. Consequently, the winds are rare and usually weak (except sea and land breezes in coastal areas) while **in tropical trade-wind climates, often located at higher latitudes than the equatorial climates, wind is almost permanent which incidentally explains why rainforest formations are impoverished compared to those of equatorial climates due to their necessary resistance to strong winds accompanying tropical disturbances.&quot;** Does this mean that in places such as Central America, Hawaii, and the Philippines, which have rainforests that are farther from the equator, (above 10 degrees North latitude) the trees are generally not as tall?

This means you can be intelligent without being creative but how can this be since high fluid intelligence is related to solving novel problems independent of previously acquired knowledge isn't this just creativity?

Text: So I was watching a report on the effects of Ivermectin treatment for Covid-19 vs a control group. This caused me to wonder about a more drastic medical situation such as the need to test a potential life saving medication for the treatment of something like cancer. I'm a software developer by training and trade, so I have an understanding of the scientific process, but I tend to work in a field where if I make a mistake...no one will die.

So assume I have a new drug that has the potential to be extremely effective at treating cancer. I believe due diligence would require to perform double blind randomized testing with this medication as well as a placebo. At this point, I feel like there's an ethical issue because are we not knowingly taking individuals with a life threatening illness and deliberately giving them a non treatment? I know there are all sorts of nuances to what I'm asking and I'm sure it's not as simple as saying the control group is receiving no treatment. But how do we test life saving medication knowing that part of our group is not going to receive any medication whatsoever? 

Or am I just drastically off base in how medicine is developed and studied?

Edit: wow, thank you everyone! I really appreciate the great responses! It all makes a lot more sense to me now.

My question is: what do we currently know (or suspect) about various fats' impact on leptin/ghrelin or satiety in general? Is it likely that certain fats are significantly better/worst in this regard? Is it likely that fats from the same family (MUFAs/PUFAs/SFAs) vary significantly between each other when it comes to hormonal impact?

and how can a valve be closed without increasing the pressure of the system? i know this is wrong because if it was true then water pipes could explode but im having trouble imagining exactly how its handled.

Text: It is my understanding that xray tubes are kind of like a light bulb, just with thousands of volts. How are the manufacturers able to &quot;set&quot; the frequency? Is it a result of the specific material used in the filament? The gas used around it? The voltage? Let's say someone wanted to change the frequency from 1*10^18hz to 1.1*10^18hz. Would there be a way to do this without having to change out the filament? 

Also, I'm guessing the tubes don't emit just a perfect x ray frequency, but probably a range of frequencies. Is this true? Is it emitting a broad spectrum like any/all frequencies from the range of A to B, or does it output in &quot;peaks&quot; like the ionization of gasses?

I use an xray and work and was talking to a technician from the manufacturer today and it got me thinking.

Text: I've been trying to delve deeper into chemistry &amp; physics lately and one thing I've learned about is electromagnetism and strong force. To my current understanding protons, and generally things with opposing charges, repel one another. This alone would cause protons to fly away from one another until nuclear strong force comes in. If I'm not mistaken nuclear strong force is the force between particles in a nucleus that allows them to be bound together, all particles have this property but neutrons to protons is the most important example as it allows a neutron to bind to two protons effectively holding the two together. My subsequent question is then obvious, if particles bind to each other and the neutral force of a neutron means there's no electromagnetic force separating them why don't massive amounts of neutrons accumulate among each other over time creating a mega neutron ball?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm assuming that this question also relates to another question of mine that being &quot;why can't I just bombard unstable isotopes of massive atoms such as oganesson with neutrons until the strong force granted by them eventually overpowers the immense electromagnetic force of all the protons.&quot; As they're both the same question of why doesn't infinitely adding neutrons to a nucleus make it infinitely more stable.

Text: Yesterday I listened to a historian who talked about the Goths. At the beginning he talked about that they don't know much about the beginning of the Goths but that they expect that they lived in what now is Poland. Why they expect that was due to signs of a similar culture found there.
He showed 1 example of such signs, it was a ring of stones (like Stonehenge but way smaller and not stacked) in a forest. The stones were around 0,5m tall and probably artificially rounded on the top.
Afterwards I asked how they know how old those stones are, but he couldn't answer my question.

So that's my question to you. How do they know when those stones were placed there? Because you can't just use the age of the stones, they are way older. Can they find that date from the chipping done in the stones? Or maybe the change in the soil? Or is there something else that is more easy to date found nearby?

furthermore, i understand that for instance non-spontaneous fission occurs when a neutron of sufficient energy interacts with the nucleus, bringing it to an unstable energy level. u235 is close to this level, and thus fissions when interacting with a neutron of even thermal energy, whereas u238 needs a higher-energy neutron to fission. high-energy photons can furthermore knock nucleons out in photodisintegration.

2.78MeV differentiate the up and down quark. This energy ought be readily available; the excited Ni60 metastate decays with a 1.33MeV γ, about half this value. Why don't we see protons transmuting to neutrons when such gamma rays hit them, especially in e.g. a plasma where there are no electrons to get in the way (at nuclear distance scales)?

sorry, i am merely a dumb computer scientist.

Text: While doing an experiment using germanium semi-conductor detector,  we used a radioactive material, which decays via positron emission. Now, this positron is emitted with some kinetic energy and   when it annihilates an electron, the total energy is higher than rest mass energy of electron+ positron. In order to conserve both energy and momentum, two photons will be emitted. Now my question is, will the wavelength of photon be lesser than 2.4 pm ( which corresponds to both electron and positron being at rest during collision) . 

Although it seems very obvious, that the wavelength should be less than 2.4pm, but while discussing this with my professor, he said a positron won't annihilate an electron unless it is in rest state before it collides with an electron??. Didn't make any sense to me why this should happen? Can somebody explain.

Text: Hello all! Bit of background: I'm a physical chemist by training, and did my doctoral work on self-assembly in conjugated polyelectrolytes. In that field there are open questions about how things like temperature, pH, salt content drive and control self-assembly and processes like liquid-liquid phase separation. I recently came across this [article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33955104/) discussing liquid-liquid phase separation of Tau. I have very marginal knowledge of the state of Alzheimer's research and whether the various hypotheses regarding plaque aggregation are causal or symptomatic. So I'd like to know more about whether the CNS of folks with Alzheimer's varies significantly in its pH and electrolytic balance vs a normative sample of CNS.

For the record: I'm no longer in academia (although I still have journal access) and my industry is semiconductors, not biomedical. So I'm not fishing for competitive advantage in this field.

Cheers, and thank you.

Text: I've read about a  [biggest cosmic explosion in history](https://nautil.us/brightest-ever-space-explosion-reveals-possible-hints-of-dark-matter-244346/) and it caused photons with at least 18 TeV of energy. Since frequency and energy are connected, it looks like that amount of energy would correspond to approx. 10\^24 Hz, which is unimaginably a lot. The wavelength for this frequency should be on the order of 10\^-16 m. Planck length is 10\^-34 m so there's still a lot of room to go there, but by that logic, there's absolutely a (huge) upper limit for a photon to have. Going backwards, Planck length to frequency, that's 10\^43 Hz and energy of about 7 GJ, or about 10\^16 TeV. Is this reasoning sound? If so, is that the absolute maximum energy a photon can have?

Playing around with numbers, that means each photon has a relativistic mass of 80 ug, which is huge. Is the only thing stopping us from generating photons of such (&quot;maximum&quot;) energy, that there are no particles with that kinds of mass which we could annihiliate?

Text: I understand that the pressure in the boundary layer (BL) changes with respect to x and so we have dP/dz=0. Where x is streamwise, y is spanwise, and z is wall-normal. According to my professor, the centripetal acceleration from curvature balances out the pressure gradient, dP/dx=v^(2)/r. In the BL, the velocity decreases at the surface, so the radius of curvature must reduce to compensate for this. This leads to tighter curvature. Is it this smaller curvature that allows pressure to bend the streamline flow to spawn crossflow?

Text: Is there any material capable of forming a surface that is not just opaque or translucent to gamma radiation, but capable of specular reflection, even of perpendicular radiation? How high can the reflectivity get?

EDIT: Can't find reflection per se, but I found something about refraction. It looks like [in 2012 someone at the Max Planck Institute succeeded in building gold lenses?](https://scitechdaily.com/high-energy-radiation-is-refracted-setting-the-stage-for-gamma-optics/)

&gt; Scientists at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich and the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching have opened up a new chapter in optics: in experiments with gamma rays at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble they have proven that these extremely high-energy electromagnetic waves can be focused by lenses like conventional light — the researchers have thus refuted a fundamental assumption of theoretical physics that had been valid for decades. Their discovery will make a great many new applications possible in medicine and materials research, for example.  
&gt; Optical instruments like telescopes and microscopes are based on the refraction of light: in a medium such as glass the electromagnetic waves propagate more slowly than in air or in a vacuum, and are therefore diffracted — for example, onto the focal plane of a photo camera. The refractive index, which depends on the lens material and the frequency of the waves, describes how large this effect is: the more it deviates from 1, the stronger the diffraction of the light beams.  
&gt; Until now, physicists had assumed that electromagnetic radiation with far greater energy than that in the visible spectrum could not be diffracted with lenses. They had calculated that the refractive index in this region of the spectrum is almost precisely 1 for all materials. **However, back in the mid-1990s it turned out that X-rays are also diffracted by beryllium or carbon lenses, and thus that X-ray optics were possible.**  
&gt; When Dietrich Habs, professor at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich and Fellow of the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching, and his team were making their measurements at the ILL they discovered that this also applies to the even higher energy gamma-rays — after X-ray optics, the era of gamma optics is now beginning.

TIL [X-Ray Optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_optics) appear to have been a thing for a while, including [mirrors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_optics#Mirrors_for_X-ray_optics).

When I used tablets and pills the relief was minimal, so I got some gelcaps, which I'd been using before, and it works almost twice as better. I've seen talk of liquid caps having higher BA in general but I'm genuinely curious if someone knows for sure about this. I don't think it's placebo, I didn't get anywhere near this relief from the others.

Text: I am not a physicist, but am having to brush up on my understanding of magnetism for my biology undergraduate thesis. Thanks in advance for hearing me out:

I am trying to establish **whether a paramagnetic salt** (manganese II chloride) **maintains its paramagnetism when dissolved in a polar, aqueous solution** (at which point, it is assumed that it would dissociate into its constituent ions). In a moment of redneck engineering, we placed a small bar magnet on the side of the manganese II chloride saturated solution, to see whether the ions would re-orient themselves in response to this applied field. **No change was observed in response to this applied field.**

I have a few questions that I'm stumped on:

**1. Does the fraction of lone pair electrons in a paramagnetic substance change dependent on the strength of an applied magnetic field?**

**2. Does the speed at which the electrons relocalize change in response to the magnitude of the applied magnetic field?** (ie. maybe we just didn't wait long enough to observe the change)

**3. If a polar aqueous solution caused the salt to lose its paramagnetism, then would a non-polar aqueous solution allow for paramagnetic retention? Is there a way to test for either of these?**

However, with steep enough banking of the road, or tilting the road inwards, it should’ve been possible to maintain that speed while getting the required amount of centripetal force. This made me think that either there is some physical reason why banking at, say, 45° isn’t possible, or there is a competitive one. However, I’ve noticed there seems to be a limitation on the banking angle on public roads as well. Why is this the case?

Text: Just by doing some basic comparisons and looking at high level trends a somewhat obvious (albeit not immediately validated) hypothesis seems to form itself…

yDNA Haplogroup G seems to have originated around the Caucasus region (where the highest diversity and rates of G are found today).

It is also home to the kartvelian language family, seemingly a final bastion from the spread of indo European and Turkic languages. A language family not known to be directly connected to any others, but influenced by indo European.


Since the spread of yDNA G, especially G2a is associated with the spread of farming in Europe and west Asia, it stands to reason that the kartvelian languages could be an offshoot descendant of a larger, older early farmer language family. Possibly similar enough to what the early European farmers would have spoken.

I can’t find anything on this in literature, Wikipedia etc but this seems a somewhat obvious subject to investigate?

I’m interested to hear if anyone knows if this has been proposed in the past or looked into.

Thanks!

Text: There have long been concerns about the health risks from artificial sweeteners. For example, recent studies indicate that artificial sweeteners could elevate blood sugar levels and raise one's risk of heart disease or stroke. There have also been reports that they alter our gut biome in harmful ways.  For example this quote ( [Artificial Sweeteners Alter Gut Bacteria in Humans | The Scientist Magazine® (the-scientist.com)](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/artificial-sweeteners-alter-gut-bacteria-in-humans-70395) ):

&quot; Now, working in the lab of Weizmann Institute of Science immunologist Eran Elinav, Suez and colleagues have taken an array of common artificial sweeteners—saccharin, sucralose, aspartame, and stevia—and filled that gap in the literature by testing them in humans. Their findings, described today (August 19) in [*Cell*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.07.016), suggest these sweeteners do indeed alter the gut microbiome, as was seen in prior mouse work. This, the researchers say, adversely impacts glucose tolerance, a measure of how readily the body moves sugar from the blood into muscle and fat, possibly leading to weight gain and diabetes. &quot;

My question is, are &quot;natural&quot; sweeteners such as those based on Monk Fruit (which gets its sweetness from a compound called, &quot;mogroside V&quot; and is often mixed with erythritol) chemically similar to artificial sweeteners and do they carry the same health risks?

I have been using monk fruit for almost two years - and recently found my blood sugar levels are too high (despite being slender and extremely fit).  Could Monk fruit be the cause?

Text: The mirror test, as I understand it, is as simple as putting a dot or a mark on an animal's forehead or other part visible in the mirror, then showing the animal their reflection to see if they interact with the mark in any way. My question is, why would we expect an animal to interact with a mark that either 1) they might just think the mark was always there, or 2) the mark wasn't bothering them before so why bother with it now? Sure, some animals might care, but I'd say cats or dogs probably wouldn't give a darn about the dot, even if they did recognize themselves in the mirror. How is the mirror test actually telling us anything about if animals recognize their reflections or not? I would think it's very assumptious to say that animals who haven't passed this test cannot identify themselves in a mirror, but am I somehow wrong?

Now let's say this person incurred hearing loss. Let's say that we use some software to raise the volume of the music they're listening on a frequency-specific and hear-specific manner, so that their perceived loudness of the music is the same as before hearing loss occured. This person turns up their music to safe volume, and then the software raises volume.

Would this person hearing be as safe from noise-induced hearing loss as if he had no volume-raising software and no hearing damage? Or would they risk just as much damage as someone with no hearing loss whatsoever?

Text: My understanding of how the rhogam shot works is that it contains a small amount of antibodies to rh-positive blood which somehow prevents the immune system from creating more. But when we get a booster shot, we get a massive increase in antibodies even if we already have antibodies present.

Why is it that similar mechanisms produce very different results?

Text: Playing some kids’ geometric puzzle pieces (and then doing some pencil &amp; paper checks), I realized something.

It started like this: I can line up a sequence of pentagons and equilateral triangles, end-to-end, and get a cycle (a segmented circle). There are 30 shapes in this cycle (15 pentagon-triangle pairs), and so the perimeter of the cycle is divided then into 30 equal straight segments.

[Here is a figure to show what i'm talking about] (https://imgur.com/NfXtoDK)

You can do something similar with squares and triangles and you get a smaller cycle: 6 square-pentagon pairs, dividing the perimeter into 12 segments.

And then you can just build it with triangles - basically you just get a hexagon with six sides.

For regular polygons beyond the pentagon, it changes. Hexagons and triangles gets you a straight line (actually, you *can* get a cycle out of these, but it isn't of segments like all the others). Then, you get cycles bending in the opposite direction with 8-, 9-, 12-, 15-, and 24-gons. For those, respectively, the perimeter (now the ‘inner’ boundary of the pattern - see the figure above for an example) is divided into 24, 18, 12, 10, and 8 segments.

You can also make cycles with some polygons on their own: triangles, squares, hexagons (three hexagons in sequence make a cycle), and you can do it a couple of ways with octagons (with four or eight). You can also make cycles with some other combinations (e.g. 10(*edited from 5*) pentagon-square pairs).

Here’s what I realized:
The least common multiple of those numbers (the number of segments to the perimeter of the triangle-polygon circle) is *360*! (at least, I’m pretty sure of it.. maybe here I have made a mistake).

This means that if you lay all those cycles on a common circle, and if you want to subdivide the circle in such a way as to catch the edges of every segment, you need 360 subdivisions.

Am I just doing some kind of circular-reasoning numerology here or is this maybe a part of the long-lost rationale for the division of the circle into 360 degrees? The wikipedia article claims it’s not known for certain but seems weighted for a “it’s close to the # of days in the year” explanation, and also nods to the fact that 360 is such a *convenient* number (can be divided lots and lots of ways - which seems related to what I noticed). Surely I am not the first discoverer of this pattern.. in fact this seems like something that would have been easy for an ancient Mesopotamian to discover..

*
*
*edit for tldr*
*
*

For those who don't understand the explanation above (i sympathize): to be clear, this method gets you exactly 360 subdivisions of a circle *but it has nothing to do with choice of units*. *It's a coincidence*, not a tautology, as some people are suggesting.. I thought it was an interesting coincidence because the method relies on constructing circles (or cycles) out of elementary geometrical objects (regular polyhedra).


The most common response below is basically what wikipedia says (i.e. common knowledge); 360 is a highly composite number, divisible by the Babylonian 60, and is close to the number of days in the year, so that probably is why the number was originally chosen. But I already recognized these points in my original post.. what I want to know is whether or not this **coincidence** has been noted before or proposed as a possible method for how the B's came up with &quot;360&quot;, *even if it's probably not true*.

Thanks!

Text: I've been having this discussion with a friend, and realized that I needed to do more investigation. I referenced a 60 Minutes episode (from a few years ago) where a scientist was able to determine if somebody was white or black just by looking at accelerometer data from when they would jump on and off of a sensor. This was independent of age, sex, or body size, implying some underlying difference in musculature and nerve reaction.

My friend countered with [this article](https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/health-general-science/are-you-there-race-its-me-dna), which calls into question whether or not race is a relevant term, and which points out that genetic diversity between we humans is really quite small. There was also [this interesting discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/10m8st/from_a_genetic_perspective_are_human_races/) along similar lines here on Reddit several years ago.

For the sake of this, let's ignore DNA testing, which I understand to be quite accurate for determining heritage. I'm also not fully convinced that arguments regarding the similarity or dis-similarity of the genetic code in a population is actually relevant. Even a tiny mutation can lead to [dramatic differences](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/gk-and-current-affairs/story/genetic-disorders-263627-2015-09-18) in structure.

So, rephrasing the question... can examination of the skeleton and/or internal organs provide sufficient information to determine whether someone is primarily from one population or another?

Text: It's a bit of a silly question, but I can't get it off my mind.

I'm putting up some Static cling window films for winter because it reduces heat loss through the glass. The dimensions are roughly about 50x38 inches.

Since I'm not covering the entire window I started wondering which part of it would be where the largest portion of the heat escapes through the window's surface. My intuition tells me it is the upper half, but I'm also not sure if there would be any appreciable difference at that scale. The way modern double-glazed windows are structured to help prevent heat loss also makes me more uncertain if it would work quite that way.

Text: Earth's water - a finite resource - moves in and out of lakes, rivers, and the ocean. How does the location and amount of water in Earth's water bodies change over time, particularly in a warming climate? The upcoming [SWOT](https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/overview/) (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) mission plans to find out.

The SUV-size satellite will measure the height of Earth's salt and fresh water around the world, [track regional shifts in sea level](https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/news/66/international-satellite-to-track-impacts-of-small-ocean-currents/) at scales never seen before, and make NASA's first truly [global survey of the planet's fresh water](https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/news/68/us-european-satellite-will-make-worlds-first-global-freshwater-survey/).

By tracking water around the world, SWOT will help us manage water resources and make decisions in communities affected by sea level rise and climate change.

SWOT is scheduled for launch in December. It is a collaboration between NASA and the French space agency Centre National d'Études Spatiales (CNES), with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency and the UK Space Agency.

We are:

+ **Eva Peral (EP)**, Systems Engineer, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
+ **Margaret Srinivasan (MS)**, SWOT Applications Lead, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
+ **Cedric David (CD)**, Hydrologist, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
+ **Ben Hamlington (BH)**, Oceanographer, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory

Ask us anything, including:

+ How SWOT can help communities manage water resources
+ What SWOT can tell us about the ocean's role in climate change
+ The engineering behind SWOT's main instrument, the Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn)
+ How SWOT will monitor fresh water sources like lakes, rivers, and reservoirs

Proof: https://twitter.com/NASAEarth/status/1589678573056626696

We'll be online from 10-11 AM PT (1-2 PM ET, 1700-1800 UTC) to answer your questions. See you soon!

Text: As far as I remember, the oxygen we breathe in becomes the final electron acceptor on the electron transport chain during cell respiration, and is released as water due to the electrons it accepts or something like that. I thought the CO2 came from the pyruvate decarboxylation step immediately after glycolysis. Doesn’t this mean that the CO2 we breathe out is converted from what we eat, not what we breathe?

Text: I've noticed lately that when I walk through the city, I can often see four species of corvids at the same time- magpies, hooded crows, rooks and jackdaws, often just within few dozen meters from each other.

There is a lot of bird species around, but they usually have their own things - some keep to water, some to parks or some wild areas, they have different beaks, diets etc. I would guess pigeons are wildly successful because they eat anything and reproduce a lot. They did push out sparrows out of the city in the last 20-30 years (though I understand there were other factors as well, like pollution).

But those city corvids have very similar diets, they're all very intelligent- how do they occupy the same space without one species dominating their niche and pushing others away? Why isn't the biggest one, or the smartest one, or the most cooperative winning? Or maybe they are more different than I think?

Text: I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the Harvard/Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. I use a mix of telescope observations, stellar evolution models, and Milky Way surveys to study binary stars -- that is, pairs of stars that are orbiting each other and (in most cases) formed from the same gas cloud. My collaborators and I recently published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06833) reporting the discovery of a binary containing a dormant black hole and a Sun-like star, orbiting each other at roughly the same distance as the Earth and the Sun. The black hole is about 10 times the mass of the Sun, so its event horizon is about 30 km. At a distance of about 1600 light years from Earth, it's about 3 times closer than the next-closest known black hole.

The black hole is fairly different from other stellar-mass black holes we know about, which are almost all bright X-ray and radio sources. They're bright because they're feeding on a companion star, and gas from the star forms a disk around the black hole where it gets heated to millions of degrees. That's how we discover those black holes in the first place. But in this one -- which we named Gaia BH1 -- the companion star is far enough away that the black hole isn't getting anything to eat, and so it's not bright in X-rays or radio. The only reason we know it's there at all is that we can see the effects of its gravity on the Sun-like star, which is orbiting an invisible object at a 100 km/s clip.

[Here's](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/05/science/astronomy-black-hole.html) a NYT article with more info about the discovery, and [here's](https://www.mpia.de/news/science/2022-16-gaia-bh1) a press release that goes into somewhat more detail.

Hello,

In the thought experiment about Schrödinger's Cat, why is it that we are allowed to assume that the cat is both dead and alive? How come we just don't say 'We don't know whether it's alive or dead until we look; so we're not going to make any assumptions until then,'? This is the part of that thought experiment I don't understand; nothing I've searched explains exactly how we are meant to think of the cat in both states.

There have apparently been a handful of second generation hybrids though, like the Liliger from a lion and a Ligress, or the Litigon from a Tigoness and a lion. I can't find anywhere if these 3-quarter of a lion are fertile. Since there has been only a small number of these animals maybe none of them happened to bear or sir offsprings (plus these hybridations are seen as unethical in the first place), but could we know theoretically?

Text: I was talking with my wife about the ulnaris and radialis nerves and which fingers they control. As I understood, each nerve is responsible for the movement of more than one finger. Since these fingers can move (mostly) independently, we asked ourselves how the signal to move a specific finger is encoded or transported to the specific finger.

Is each nerve like a bundle of smaller nerves and each &quot;fiber&quot; only transmits the signal towards its specific receiver? Or is the signal somehow encoded and all signals travel through the same nerve and are somehow decoded at the correct recipient? Or are we totally wrong about how nerves function in general (I have heard about synapses, neurons and neurotransmitters but do not understand the &quot;macroscopic&quot; function of nerves.

In short: How can one nerve control several independently moveable fingers.

Text: The way I understand it, the SRY gene is found on the Y chromosome, and it encodes for TDF. This, in turn, leads to prenatal testosterone and AMH. The prenatal testosterone lead to the development of the male reproductive system from the Wolffian duct while AMH leads to the disintegration of the Mullerian duct. Conversely, if there is no Y chromosome and no upsurge of testosterone or presence of AMH, the Wolffian duct disintegrates while the Mullerian duct develops into the female reproductive tract.

In that case, it seems like people with XO genotypes have no Y chromosome = no TDF = no AMH/high levels of T, so they should develop ovaries. What am I missing?

Text: I guess &quot;mindreading&quot; would the the broad term for this, but I'm talking more like being able to record what someone is thinking and hearing when they are dreaming, hallucinating, or asked to imagine the image of a frog, for example. I know next to nothing about neurology, so this is probably way off, but I imagine that we'd have to first scan a person's brain so we can see what electrical impulses are occurring and where, and then we'd have to understand the function of each individual neuron or whatever, and then be able to interpret patterns from whatever the current combination of electric signals are in said person brain. Then we'd have to convert that analog information to a digital visual and auditory representation that can be displayed on a screen. But I suppose one of the biggest problems is that everyone's brain is different, so even if you could interpret one person's brain, it wouldn't work on another. You'd have to have some kind of AI that could dynamically analyze the pattern of any given person's brain and understand how it functions.

Again this is just my uninformed, speculative rambling. I'm interested to hear from more knowledgeable people how this could actually work though. The benefits of such a technology are truly mindblowing. Imagine the creative potential for art, music, fictional writing, movies, etc., if we were able to do this? Imagine being able to actually see and hear what a person experienced during a sleep paralysis episode! True horror movie potential right there. Imagine what we could learn about people with mental illness, or learn about the similarities in how we all think. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

I am currently having difficulty understanding the difference between a free radical and a radical neutral. I know a free radical is any transient species, but how does that differ from a radical neutral? My research is into plasma characteristics, and a quote from the paper I am reading states, &quot;the most important parameter in low-temperature plasmas is often the density of the radical neutral.&quot; I'm not too sure what this means without understanding radical neutrals.

Any clarity on radical neutrals/the above quote would be much appreciated! :)

It can be assumed the resulting disorders from the infection would be far different but the concept doesn't seem as rare as a google search would imply.

Text: Since I'm not any versed in neuroscience. I have read that there are some methods where which the brain tries to functionally recover. This involves neurogenesis and neuroplasticity.

From my understanding, with not as much research, neurogenesis isn't going to replace damaged cells, but it will help functionally promote more cells of the damage brain in places like the hippocampus and the amygdala. Neuroplasticity is when the brain rewires where the damaged brain function is to another part of the brain to get it to work properly. Maybe a section of one side of the hippocampus isn't functioning properly, that hippocampus function might be rewired to the other one or another part of the brain entirely.

Hello all, 

Are there any cases where an individual might test negative (outside of the window period) using HIV RNA PCR &amp; antibody/antigen testing despite actually being positive?

Is it possible that someone might have some weird/rare mutation that causes the HIV RNA PCR test to not detect any HIV despite it being present?

If so, would that mutation also impact the HIV antibodies to where they are also not detectable?

We've experimented with dough, meats, vegetables, sweets, made a seven-ingredient slice of cheesecake, and printed chicken samples which were then cooked by lasers. Currently, we are focusing on building robust software and hardware to incorporate more functionality to print food of different consistencies and multi-ingredient combinations to fully showcase this tech's potential.

In August 2022, my work was featured in Interesting Engineering, and the publication helped organize this AMA session. Ask me anything about the technology behind 3D-printed food, the how-tos on printing food, how lasers can cook food, how 3D-printed food can be inventive, nutritious, and customized for each individual.

Assuming you can control the frequency (and hence the energy) of the photon, you can theoretically send a photon of any arbitrary energy towards the atom. Let's say that the energy required to excite the electron from the 1s state to 2s is 1. (Some arbitrary units) And the energy to from 2s to 2p is 0.5 in the same units. Now if I fire a photon of 1.4 energy units, where does the extra 0.4 energy go? There's no further sub quanta of energy it can excite the electron to. Does that mean that such a photon will never be absorbed by the atom? Is there some non quantized sink of energy it can go to, like the kinetic energy of the atom or something like that?

But if the water is held together only by cohesive forces, how does it change with &quot;depth&quot;? In the book they were free floating and various sized

Water is less dense as a solid so pressure causes it to melt, so I'm not thinking there could be a solid core by pressure.  I'm wondering, if there was a drop of water 14 miles across (so the center is as far from the surface s the Challenger Deep), what would the pressure be at the center? Could we scuba all the way through?

Maybe it would help to imagine a spherical &quot;drop&quot; of water of radius (depth) x, in free fall, with enough of a &quot;balloon&quot; around it to prevent heat loss and evaporation but not add and &quot;squeeze pressure.&quot; How would pressure change through the pond?

Every year, [more than 300,000 people worldwide die from complications related to seasonal influenza](https://www.who.int/teams/global-influenza-programme/surveillance-and-monitoring/burden-of-disease). Even though the yearly flu shot [reduces infections, decreases hospitalizations and prevents thousands of deaths](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/vaccineeffect.htm), there is clearly more work to be done. Further complicating things is that many of the typical symptoms of flu overlap with symptoms of COVID-19, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection and the common cold.

Join us today at 2 PM ET (19 UT) for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), about seasonal and pandemic influenza. We'll answer your questions about why we need a different flu shot every year, talk about the process of identifying, making and delivering the flu vaccine, and discuss strategies for minimizing (and hopefully preventing) the spread of influenza. Ask us anything!

But still, one would imagine that given the major physical similarities (due to similar pressures, I assume), and the tail being equally important to both crocs and gators, the pressures that caused the alligator to develop/retain its tail regrowth trait would also apply to crocodiles. So why can't they do it?

Text: I saw a post about chickenpox in this sub and the common spots, but this made me wonder why hand foot and mouth disease (coxsackievirus A16) specifically causes blisters and rashes on these extremities. I am not well versed in virology or histology, so if this belongs in another sub please let me know (like r/Nodumbquestions) Thank you!!

Edit: Y’all I know WHY it’s called Hand foot and mouth 😭 thank you for clarifying. I’m asking WHY the blisters form on the hands, feet, and in the mouth rather than indiscriminately all over the body, such as with other viruses like varicella (chickenpox)

The paint is applied, and after you stick your hand under a UV lamp for 45-60 seconds, it’s hard as a rock and completely dry.  What is happening during that 1 minute “curing” process? Why does a higher UV wattage (160+) work faster? What is the difference with regular nail polish vs gel polish if acetone removes both (but they dry differently)?

I've spent a lot of time around volcanoes in the PNW, from Mt. Baker to Shasta, and never seen that quantity of cinder cones on any of them (although Adams does have a very distinctive cinder cone on the north side.)  I assume at least some of them would be erased by glacial activity, but apparently Moana Kea used to have glaciers.

Text: The information paradox is challenged with black holes and hawking radiation because as long as the black hole has the same mass, angular momentum and electric charge, information emitted will be the same. The state space has many more dimensions than those 3 variables, so a bunch of states can be transformed into the same one. This relies on Hawking knowing that a black hole is not affected by timing of consuming matter, non-electric charge aspects of the matter (such as chemical composition), and all those other dimensions in the input space. How could he have narrowed out all those input variables?

Text: Hi, I'm Ben Masters, wildlife filmmaker and ocelot enthusiast. I studied wildlife biology at Texas A&amp;M University and founded the production company [Fin and Fur Films](https://www.finandfurfilms.com/about) in 2015. 

There are fewer than 120 ocelots remaining in the US. With many factors acting against them, there is still hope for their survival, if opposing parties can come to an agreement on their management methods. I've spent years in Texas capturing the first-ever high-quality footage of American ocelots in the wild, meeting with stakeholders along the way to raise awareness about conservation solutions.

You can learn more about these efforts in the recent PBS Nature documentary &quot;[American Ocelot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiQ8zOlWHUQ&amp;t),&quot; now available to stream in the US.

I'll be answering your questions at 1 pm ET (18 UT). Ask me anything!

Text: Let's say an astronomer notices something worth studying out there.... How do they tell other astronomers around the world, or just record exactly where they are looking at? For instance for coordinates on Earth they'd give a lat/long and that would always be the same place.

&amp;#x200B;

But in space, everything is in motion and therefore relative to the observer.  The earth is moving in space, and rotating as is whatever object is being studied.    So on any given day, or even time, the object being studying is not going to be in the same 'relative' space as it was yesterday, etc....

&amp;#x200B;

So how are coordinates marked for collaboration or future study?

Text: Now that NASA is planning on colonizing the moon, and possibly mars soon, I had a thought that's been lingering in my mind.

Say for example, theoretically. We built a space elavator or just a very long wire that carries data from mars to earth, or just moon to earth, and say it's a perfect cable that has 0 ping.

Relativity states that the more massive an object is, it dilates time around it. So if we go further from the earth say a vaccuum of space such as the moon, there would be time dilation right?

If we set up a skype call using that &quot;data elevator&quot; with the people on the moon or mars, would we see them as they were a few nanoseconds ago? Meaning will there be a noticeable time dilation or does time dilation go out of the question since we're now observing them in real time?

46 individual chromatin &quot;pieces&quot; that just take on the form of chromosomes during replication and go back to their chromatin form during interphase?

Text: From what I learned in high school, every B cell in every lymph node is entirely unique since the structure of the surface receptors is randomly generated, causing each B cell to recognise a different antigen. However, whenever there is an infection in the body, it always seems like the closest lymph nodes are the ones active, eg. under the jaw during a cold, or under the armpit after a vaccine. Wouldn’t there be just as much chance that the B cell able to identify your sore throat antigens lives in a lymph node further from the site of infection like the groin, ect.? Does the B cell travel to a closer lymph node  once activated? Or are there many different B cells that can recognise an antigen to varying degrees, and the closest ones mount the fastest immune response, even if a B cell further away could do a better job?

Text: (Quick info to start with, I'm from Germany, so I may make some mistakes with the technical vocabulary and some best practices may differ)


So this is a kinda awkward question for me to ask, considering I'm an electrical engineer planning the electrical systems for all kind of construction projects, and I like to think I'm quite good at it, including the technical side.


But during a conversation with a colleague yesterday, we noticed we both can't quite explain how exactly the drection of the flow of power is measured in AC power systems (compared to DC, where it's really easy). We both know it's possible, we both have watched old electricity meters (like [this one](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Drehstromzaehler_offen.jpg)) run backwards when either wired incorrectly or when the measured system is actually feeding power into the mains, for example with solar panels. And while I understand the basic principles of those old meters (it's essentially a finely tuned linear induction motor), what I can't figure out is how the **direction** of the powerflow is determined. Even worse with modern electronic meters, those don't even have moving parts where I could at least justify that they work the same as the old ones. And yet those to can determine the direction and don't measure currents running in the opposite direction (for example again with solar panels when you don't actually have a contact for receive compensation for the power you provide. The meter simply doesn't count up or down when you produce more than you need and thus are feeding into the mains. Mechanical meters solved this with a ratchet system.)

AC power doesn't have an inherent direction, that's its fundamental principle. So how do those meters do it? The only thing I can come up with is that it's basically more like &quot;measuring&quot; the voltage differential between one side and the other, or at least that that is what determines the direction. But *how*? What physical effects are used to electronically measure if power is flowing from A to B and when it's going from B to A?

Thanks for any explanations you can provide, the more detailed and in depth the better.

Text: We're the Auto Terra Project, one of the top 25 teams in the US competing in the NASA Deep Space Food Challenge, a competition to create the Mars habitat food production system.  This system will be used to feed the astronauts at every step of the mission.  You'll see us listed on their website as the Arrakis Terrarium Project, as we recently rebranded: https://www.deepspacefoodchallenge.org/teams

Our solution centers around enclosed ecosystems!  Think of a 4 foot by 4 foot by 26 inch (1.2 meters by 1.2 meters by 0.66 meters) climate-controlled community garden plot in a box, complete with a water cycle, lights, temperature control, humidity control, sensor data, and more.  The internals are separate from the externals, meaning that the plants have an ideal environment despite what's going on outside.  We have proof of concept, and if you would like to see our prototype, some of our harvest, and our work, feel free to check out our website: https://autoterraproject.co/

We would also like to someday use our devices to strengthen food security on Earth by partnering with nonprofits to put these into the homes of people in need.  The devices require 0 daily maintenance and allow the users to access fresh foods whenever needed, without having to worry about supply lines, costs in grocery stores, or transportation.

If you'd like to support us, the biggest thing you can do is to get on our website and sign up to our email list!  It'll help us show others that our project is important and aid us in getting additional funding to continue our work.

The people answering questions from our team include:

+ **Ariel Shramko** (/u/ATPSpaceFood) the environmental engineer on the team.  They create the criteria for the ecosystem, create the ecosystem itself, monitor the health of the units, and complete some of the chemical engineering within the project as well.
+ **Eliot Pirone** (/u/Necessary_Ad_126) the mechanical engineer behind the physical design of the project.  If Ariel determines what the units need to do to maintain healthy environments for the plants and changes the living matter within the ecosystems, Eliot figures out how to make that happen.

The team will begin answering questions at 12pm EST (17 UT). Thanks for listening, AUA!

Text: I was recently discussing how hard it is to retrofit online multiplayer onto classic arcade games, as they expected the other players input to be right there on a wire plugged into the PCB. However one earlier solution to this was used by the [XBAND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XBAND) service, where each user would run the game locally, but with lock-step inputs of their own controller and the remote player, who was dialled directly into your XBAND adapter.

My real question is, what would have been the latency of such a direct call? Assuming two users in urban environments, say one in San Francisco and one in Los Angeles. Every resource I can find talks about general internet latency in the dial-up era, but that involves routing and multiple machines, or talks about modern cell-phone calls, which have a more complex set-up and teardown. You're directly dialled into someone else, it's a voice call, what's the latency on that?

Were Neanderthals ever competing against early humans without the gene change?

What are the influenza contagion mechanisms that determine when you are contagious?

* How long do the effects last? Could you lay down for 10 minutes before a visit to the doctor to gain back that height?

Text: I've always observed this when looking out of the window on trains and now I started noticing it also shows on other dual-pane windows too but never on normal windows. 

The thing I'm describing is most of the times really subtle, and it can be described as seeing two really close (almost matching) reflections of one random object. One of these two is &quot;shifted&quot; towards a color (e.g. purple) and the other one has its color modified towards the complementary one (in the example, yellow). 

Where the two reflections overlap the color is the same of the object, but as I said they don't fit perfectly and this results in the object having an &quot;aura like&quot; edge (in the example the reflection would show a slightly more purple edge and a yellowish one on the opposite side). 

I know this has something to do with optics and wavelengths but I can't get my head around it. Can someone help me figure it out?

The closest I can find is [these](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01351-4) two [articles,](https://www.nature.com/articles/154013c0) with the second giving a minimum vision that seems equivalent to X-rays using the math I have.  Even the conventional range of lux (100 microlux to 100 Kilolux) doesn’t feel like it’s expansive enough because it’s constrained to sunlight.

Edit: It specifically doesn’t feel sufficient because we can see stars in the night sky, as per the [lux definition.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux#Illuminance) the maximum is also too low because surfaces under the sun aren’t blinding.

Text: What is going on?
A piece of raw meat is moderately firm, if supple.
Cooked well, it becomes phenomenally soft tender and soft, such that it barely requires chewing;
HOWEVER, with the heat applloed differently, it can char into an even firmer, harder, state.

What's going on chemically?
Obviously the intensity and time of the heat applied plays a role; what other factors are involved? Are there consistent principles? What are they?

Thanks much!

Text: I understand the very basics of how CAS9 enzyme cuts off a gene with a guide RNA to help it locate,, but what's still unclear to me is what we do with the DNA breaks

• If we let the cells repair it by themselves, will they not just remake the segment we just cut off?
• If we insert a new gene, how exactly do we deliver it? Does it come with the CAS9 and guide RNA complex? Or do we use another enzyme to deliver it separately?

I've just started learning about this topic so I'm sorry if my question seems very basic. I've tried searching online it but so far I've only gotten things like, &quot;We insert the gene...&quot; &quot;We deliver the new gene...&quot; or &quot;The new DNA segment is delivered&quot; without specifying *how* it was delivered

Text: I've just read an article which states that Sri Lanka is losing up to USD $30 million per month in foreign exchange, and cites gold smuggling as one cause of that. As a result of that, passengers are being forbidden from wearing 24k gold while traveling in or out of the country by plane.

I understand why smuggling gold OUT of the country could be harmful, but what economic harm could come from smuggling gold IN? Presumably people are smuggling gold so that they can sell it for fiat currency. I would think that exchanging their less valuable, inflated currency for a more tangible asset like gold, which holds its value and could be exchanged for more valuable foreign currency, would be an overall positive for their economy.

Text: I hear it thrown around frequently that Uranium (also sometimes Plutonium) is the heaviest element which occurs naturally. I have recently learned, however, that the Oklo natural fission reactor is known to have at one time produced elements as heavy as Fermium. When the phrase &quot;heaviest natural element&quot; is used, how exact is that statement? Is there an atomic weight where it is theoretically impossible for a single atom to have once existed? For example, is there no possible scenario in which a single atom of Rutherfordium once existed without human intervention? If this is the case, what is the limiting factor? If not, is it simply the fact that increasing weights after uranium are EXTREMELY unlikely to form, but it is possible that trace amounts have come into existence in the last 14 billion years?

Or would a better model be akin to smushing/mixing together balls of Play-Doh?

Or put another way, do subatomic particles experience collision/volume like mass at a macroscopic scale (or does another force provide a similar property)? My understanding is that collision as we experience it is a result of electromagnetic forces.

There's a continual concern in the book that if they turn life support back on, the bodies will start to rot. But presumably many of the microorganisms that contribute to decomposition will have also died in the vacuum over the preceding 20 years. Assuming the crew that turns the lights back on doesn't introduce new microorganisms to the environment, would the bodies actually decompose when re-exposed to oxygen and heat, or would they be preserved?

Text: The question is simple, but the answer is difficult.

If you have a neutron in, say, a helium atom... that neutron is stable for billions of years.

Contrast this with a free neutron, which has a half life estimated to be somewhere between 10 and 15 minutes. Free neutrons decay into a proton, an electron and a gamma ray (and an antineutrino or something like that?)

So what is it that makes such a huge difference in the stability of neutrons (in a nucleus vs free)?

I'm lost with this article (u can find it easily on the web by entering the title)... can someone help me?

1. it's all about the ganos fault (GF) ; a segment in the north anatolian fault (NAF) located in turkey and which is the cause of many earthquakes. The GF was examined using geophysical tools in order to decipher its tectonic evolution, its morphological and structural properties, its fault-fluid relationships. But to obtain comprehensive results they used the magnetotellurics method (it's bc of the fluids in the pores but can u explain me the whole process with a logical structure)

2.There's a topographic map and i don't understand how it works with the geological periods (for example miocene then eocene and alluvium why ?)

3. And finally what is 'dimensionality' and what are 'galvanic distortions' ?

Text: Hello all, I've been deeply interested in Planetary Sciences and the early evolution of the solar system. I'm also the lead on the initial Mineralogy/Petrology of the meteorites found by the Australian Desert Fireball Network (DFN), an interdisciplinary research group that is working to uncover the mysteries surrounding solar system formation. Digital observatories, part of the DFN, monitor a third of Australian skies, all night. The DFN images and studies the paths of fireballs in the sky, their trajectories, and orbits using intelligent imaging systems. As a geologist, I want to know where rocks come from, along with their composition and distribution. Trying to mesh those two is kind of the holy grail in figuring out what the solar system is really like. In 2006, an asteroid was named after me - Asteroid 6579 - for my contributions to planetary science.

In August 2022, my work was featured in [Interesting Engineering](https://interestingengineering.com/science/astrogeologist-space-rocks-important), and the publication helped organize this AMA session. Ask me anything about asteroids, meteorites, planetary science, and my work with the Desert Fireball Network.

Text: I've been looking at things like using [solar panels on water canals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCRX232VkBk) and other man made structures for water, in addition to technology just meant to reduce evaporation.   I see a bunch of figures like &quot;decreases evaporation by x%&quot; and it's being peddled as a solution to water crisis in dry areas (now made dryer due to climate change).  What I don't understand is that water has to get into the atmosphere to cause rain and other things.  So decreasing evaporation here reduces the amount of water going into the atmosphere.  If you aren't *increasing* the amount of water in the system (say in California), then you still have dry-problems, accept now, your soil might be even drier due to the humidity being lower over all, and you may even be affecting climates around the area inadvertently right? 

The only positive sum game I can see with this is if this somehow caused more *ocean* water to contribute to for example, the California climate.  

**So does preventing evaporation on these structures ultimately cause negative environmental impact over the long term?**

Although it seems rare, patients can be awake and sometimes need to move while connect to the ECMO. 

Since your urge to breathe comes from the build up of carbon dioxide in your blood (carbon dioxide that the ECMO is removing), does this mean a patient on an ECMO doesn't feel the need to breathe or is this an oversimplification?

Text: Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Economics, Political Science, Linguistics, Anthropology**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for 'X' were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;.

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

If you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/about/sticky).

Text: A common conspiracy theory you hear, particularly in the &quot;targeted individual&quot; community, is that military/intelligence agencies have the technology to secretly detect brain activity from a distance and extract meaningful information from it and even modify said brain activity without any conspicuous or invasive device. Basically remote mind reading and mind control. 

They often cite patents such as these as proof this technology exists or has been worked on: 

https://patents.google.com/patent/US3951134A/en

https://patents.google.com/patent/US6017302A/en

I was arguing with someone who believes this and it got me wondering about the technical feasibility of this concept. I don't know enough about neuroimaging and EEG to answer the question.

so is there a limit to this?

If an object is lifted higher and higher until it is only negligibly affected by the earth's gravitational field, does the amount of potential energy it gain keep increasing too?

If so, is there a standard way to convert that into human-visible color in RGB terms, given an ISO-standard monitor?  Is there an industry standard calculation between the output of a visual-wavelength telescope and an image on nasa.gov?

If it helps: I was reading about [gilding metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilding_metal) and wondered if there was a visual difference between, say 6:1 Cu/Zn brass and 12:1 Cu/Zn brass, assuming two samples were measured in the same facility after processing them to equal polish, etc.

does it comes down with rain or disperse into the atmosphere breaking down into something else?

Text: I know this seems like a broad question, but I didn’t know how to summarize my question adequately for the title. I’ve been trying to understand different evidences of common ancestry, and one topic that had been brought up was the discovery of endogenous retroviruses and their presence in the human genome and other animals, which points to a common ancestor.

To clarify, my question is how do we know the retroviruses found in our DNA and the DNA of other species are from a virus infecting a common ancestor, and not a result of a prevalent virus in the past that infected multiple species around the same time, resulting in an alteration of the genomes of different species but occurring around the same time? If that makes sense.

I don’t necessarily believe that, but growing up in a very conservative, 6-day creationist, Christian household, I think that it’s a thought that could pop up in response to the ERV findings, so I am interested in what the rebuttal would be. I am not knowledgeable at all in these areas, and so I’m grateful to anyone who can help me understand and learn this in a simpler way, if possible. Thanks!

Text: Recently i came across a similar question in another field here (meteorology) that i've been asking myself, which reminded me of this question.


I'm more interested about the physiological/neurological perspective. External solutions like exoskeletons are fascinating too, but at least for me they are a separate less medicine more technology matter.


The 30 year time frame is somewhat arbitrary, tough i picked it cause it's the point in time before computers and the benefits they brought along become more common. Also i assume that the care improved a lot when tomographic machines became more widespread.

Text: Google search is telling me 2 completely opposite things.

On every video about orbits it always shows the orbiting body moving faster the closer it is to the thing it is orbiting. As well as this spacecraft often use a planets gravity to slingshot to their next destination, which again implies an increase in velocity.

But if our planet is constantly accelerating and decelerating depending on its position in the orbit of the sun, wouldn't we feel it?

Text: This is probably a very stupid question but Google does not seem to help at all and it's been bugging me for the last 2 hours. 

The title is a very shortened and simplified version of my question, so let me explain it in more detail.

For example, a (obviously homozygous) blonde man and a homozygous dark haired woman had a female child. The daughter would be (again obviously) heterozygous, hair color-wise, meaning she has one allele coding light hair from her father and another one coding dark hair from her mother. By the laws of (probably highly simplified) genetics, the daughter would have inhairited dark hair, as the dark hair allele is the dominant one in her genotype. However, as I understand, to make sure both famale and male organisms have roughly the same level of gene expression in both sexes, RANDOM one of the X chromosomes in female organisms gets inactivated. Now back to the whole cat fiasco. I was reading about tortoiseshell cats and everything made perfect sense to me. Since one of the cat's X chromosome located alleles codes for orange hair, and another variation of it codes for black, AND  one gets inactivated with basically a 50/50 chance, the cats fur presents as a black-orange mosaic depending on the pigment amount/pigment variation coded in a specific cell. Back to our heterozygous daughter. Why isn't her hair a blonde-black mosaic? If the chromosome inactivated was inharited from her mother, the strand should be blonde and vice versa.
Now, I do have some theories about why that doesn't happen. For once, this overly simplified model of hair color inharitance is basically high school level genetics, so I'm sure someone's true hair color is determined by a variation of many genes. 
Another explenation would be the hair color genes only being situated on the 23rd pair in cats. 
Unfortunately, this just raised more questions in me. It can't only be cats then, right? Does any other mammal have this fur variation or something analogical? It also can't possibly only affect hair color, surely there are other alleles on the sex chromosomes that would fit into this weird expression loophole. 
While answering, try not to be to rough. I'm only just out of high school and about to re-take my finals. I'm very passionate about biology and so interested in genetics, but sometimes I just don't completely understand. Hope I got the terminology right, my Polish high school offered an &quot;English speaking&quot; biology class but the teacher actually didn't speak any English and she would just resort to handing out some English homework she stole of the web, lol.

Text: I was painting my linen closet on the weekend (stay with me here this is relevant I promise) and there was a really awkward area behind the door jam that I had to bend weirdly to paint with my dominant hand. The other side of the closet had the same geometry and it was impossible to paint that spot with my dominant hand so I had a crack with my non dominant and did a half decent job. (there were shelves built into the closet so it was impossible to step inside to be in a better position.) 

For a summer job I cleaned windows on high rises (look up rope access if you're interested) and from the outset my boss trained me to practice cleaning with both hands while learning so I could cover more area at once.

*tldr questions start here:*
Anyway, this got me thinking, when a surgeon is digging through a body cavity, are there any awkward spots? Do you ever find that you can't reach from a particular angle and the other hand reaches better? Is this really bad practice? Do you just reposition your paitient? Are there more reachy tools that do the trick? Ever been forced to abandon a procedure because you've realised you've come from the wrong angle? Are there any skills that you by default train yourself to do ambidextrous because it'll come in handy? Or is this never an issue?

So forgive the ramblings of this madman. Genuinely curious as to how this all works.

Text: Here in the UK there are currently a bunch of cases of iGAS (invasive group strep A) and it seems to me to be acting similar to what I've heard of severe bacterial meningitis that has turned septic. Is this a fair comparison in any aspect? If so, in what way and or not? I'm really curious.

I'm aware of streptoccocus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis (aka meningoccocus) and haemophilius influenzae being the bacteria responsible for meningitis septicaemia.

Text: I genuinely tried my best to reaserch this on my own but couldn't find the information i need.

My    understanding is that EE2 is not like, say, Estradiol valerate or    estradiol hemihydrate just estradiol with something to transport it but a    different hormone. Is that correct?

I    looked at the chemical structure and wondered what it is that makes   EE2  interact differently with the (intracellular) estrogen   receptors(120%  at the ERalpha and 44% at the beta receptor; compared to   E2) [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Affinities\_of\_estrogen\_receptor\_ligands\_for\_the\_ER%CE%B1\_and\_ER%CE%B2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Affinities_of_estrogen_receptor_ligands_for_the_ER%CE%B1_and_ER%CE%B2)

Is it understood why that is? Is it possible for a hobbyist to understand the biochemical reason for that?

If anyone could explain this to me or give me a hint what so search for I would appreciate it. Thank you very much in advance.

Text: On my weather app on my phone I always see the temperature line across the week and I just noticed that during winter the peaks and valleys are a lot shallower than in summer. So I checked historical data from my location and indeed, on clear summer days, the temperature can reach 35 degrees celsius during the day and drop to around 15 at night, that's a temperature change of 20 degrees. In winter, the biggest change I found for my location is 10 degrees. But overall, it seems to me that the changes are more dramatic in summer than in winter.

Is it overall cloud coverage? Is it absolute humidity? Is it the energy cost of water freezing and melting? Or is it just my location that is like this?

Text: I have been wondering lately what the theoretical top speed of a helicopter would be. I have a basic understanding of retreating blade stalls and keep seeing it listed as one of the main limitations to a helicopters top speed, along with the advancing blade eventually breaking the speed of sound creating shockwaves and the more obvious ones like drag.

In theory if we imagine we have a helicopter with an infinitely powerful engine and made of materials that would never be damaged from heat or the forces caused by flying at high speeds, would these limits still apply? If it is a coaxial helicopter then the retreating blade stall shouldn't be a problem as it would be stalling on opposite sides at the same time and if the rotors are made of this theoretical material the shockwaves wouldn't damage them. Would this theoretical helicopter still have some hard limit to the maximum speed it could achieve?

Text: I'm writing a story, and one of my characters who is intersex has a child at one point. I thought it would be poetic and be a great part of his arc if his kid was intersex like him, allowing him to guide his kid in a way he was never guided. However, considering how low the chances of obvious intersexuality are (which doesn't count very minor intersexuality or intersexuality that is entirely internal, and therefore unnoticeable), it would seem sort of contrived if his kid also happened to be intersex. However, if it's hereditary, that wouldn't be an issue. So how does that work, exactly?

Thumbs in primates are obviously quite beneficial while the fifth finger for animals like dogs are not too useful. But they generally always have a fixed number. When did vertebrates (or animals in general) converge towards this constant number? Do we have fossil/current evidence of animals which did not follow this number? I understand if the answer to this might not be fully clear, but do we have an idea as to why animals converged to 5 and not any other number? Are slightly more/less fingers any more or less beneficial for most vertebrates?

It dives into numerous utopian and radical subcultures, from cryptoanarchists, cypherpunks, and gold-standard libertarians to Extropians and transhumanists, all of whom - as it turned out - were tied into the project of trying to invent computational money.

+ Will crypto change how we think about money?
+ Where else is cryptography used?
+ How did cryptocurrency begin?
+ Are cryptocurrencies hacker-proof?
+ What problems has cryptography solved?

Text: Does there exist a gas that changes in response to magnetic fields in its surrounding?

Could one theoretically manipulate such a gas in a meaningful way with magnets? I.e. if gas was placed in a hermetically sealed cylinder with some spinning magnets at the top and bottom, or on the sides or whatever, could you create a predictable vortex / any predictable fluid flow within the tube? Assuming you find some smart person to piece out all the complicated math of spinning magnetic fields and fluids etc.

What's the limiting technology for this?

Text: Tl;dr: why is your cough during an upper respiratory infection not as bad as your post viral cough? (In the absence of asthma or secondary infection)

Hey folks! This question is perplexing me and I can’t seem to find a specific answer via google.

I think I understand why post viral cough happens in the first place: Your mucosa are already inflamed from the infection and immune response. Your cough reflex is hypersensitive because it kicked into gear to fight the virus. As such, the smallest irritations (such as post nasal drip or cold air) are far more likely to trigger a cough. This takes a while to calm down. 

What I don’t understand is the severity and duration. Post viral coughs can take way longer to clear than the virus or any other symptoms. And people often complain of their post viral cough being more frequent, dry, painful and disruptive than when they were sick.

This has been my experience at least. Sometimes I have a cold and barely cough at all. Then as soon as my nose clears up, coughing fits keep me awake at night for 2 weeks. (And I have no comorbidities or secondary infections.) 

So what’s going on there? Is there like an inflammation cycle? Are my observations totally off?

— 
EDIT: Thanks so much for these responses! I want to clarify for people requesting/dispensing medical advice: please don’t! It’s against the rules of the sub. My question is *only* about the irritating unpleasant cough that 1) happens after mild illness 2) your doctor tells you not to worry about and 3) goes away on its own.

Text: To move something in space we have to generate thrust right? So to do that something has to be ejected in the opposite direction? Like gas or jet exhaust? 

Old school cathode ray tubes TVs shoot an electron beam, in a vacuum, guided by magnets at a phosphorescent material. These electrons then excite the pixels and produces photons. 

So assuming we cut off the display end of a tv and attached it to an item in space could the electron beam be able to move said object. 

Electrons are basically massless but if we had enough being shot out would the cumulative effect be enough to generate thrust in the opposite direction?

I’m not high I’m just not knowledgeable enough to figure it out.

Edit: Hi all, thank you for the replies. The bit about the + charge affecting the “spacecraft” and attracting what negatively charged particles may be in the vicinity, after a while, I hadn’t thought about. Makes total sense of course, additionally I had no idea ION thrusters were a thing. Lots to read up on.

Text: From my understanding, a photon is essentially a self-propagating oscillation in the electromagnetic field, with the electric and magnetic components out of phase with each-other by 90 degrees. Due to the way in which a changing magnetic field induces an electric field and vice-versa, this combined oscillation ends up propagating through space at the speed of light.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is: Do Gluons, W and Z bosons and the Higgs boson propagate via similar methods to the photon but just using different fields, or is their method of propagation completely different? The other types of bosons feel so mysterious to me in comparison to photons, so I'd love to learn more about how they work

I'm wondering how or why did they become multi-cellular and what could've been the first organisms we could actually see (with our own eyes not a microscope) mostly before the proterozoic period? I'd say we have some examples today, but I'm gonna assume our bacterias had their own evolution through time also.


Side rant- I wish we could've just stayed in the warm primordial soup so we don't have to pay taxes, but noo, we just had to enjoy land 🙄

(I'm still heavily learning but my new hyper fixation is learning about the earliest life, and for obvious reasons it's kinda hard to research something so long ago. And most of my knowledge is being built by small easy to follow informational vids on YouTube, like PBS Eons is one of my faves for example. But most stuff would be on prehistoric animal lines we could follow from today.) 

If you have any interesting videos or creators to share please let me know! I do have the attention span of a mentally set back squirrel but this is also something I'm very interested in, not just this but all prehistoric biology. I use TikTok and other social media's too so not just YouTube!

To clarify, I'm not trying to challenge the idea that genetic mutations are random, I'm just trying to understand the framework, especially in the broader context of evolution.



Edit: Thanks everyone who's responded! This has pointed me in the direction of thinking more along the lines of distribution of cancers + mutations in general in different types of cells + in specific genes and considering the complex environmental causes/risk factors (?) of cell mutations, which feels more comprehensive and like I'm on the right track. I feel like I may need to go more in depth to understand this in the broad context of genetics + evolution, so I might have to look for some good (maybe basic, for now) reading materials or something.

Text: Dinosaurs, enormous birds, giant sloths — there used to be an abundance of huge organisms compared to the size range covered across species today. I've often heard the ability for organisms to grow to such sizes is correlated with higher concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere, is this accurate? And beyond that, for organisms that grew to be so massive, did they simply contain a larger number of cells not much different from the animal and plant cells we see today (granted there's variation within those categories), or were individual cells also larger themselves? Perhaps the surface area to volume ratio could have differed based on oxygen availability and thus enhanced cell transport?

Is Gorilla chest beating solely for a threat display or is that something made up by people who wanted to depict certain characters?

Text: ~background info~

I've found an interesting series of videos that talk about humongous structures in space like the dyson sphere. One of these structures is called the shkadov thruster which is capable of accelerating stars. The actual acceleration is very slow and would take billions of years to get any decent velocity out of it, but the concept is fascinating - taking billions of years, untold resources and a star to make the biggest bomb in history.

So I'm curious, what would it actually do if it hit something? I'm fairly certain everything in the size of the solar system would be basically gone. So would this annihilate some significant portion of the galaxy?

Millions and millions of gallons are used DAILY, which surely can’t be sustainable long-term. Especially so with the population now reaching 8 billion and climbing. Is there actually a plan in place or is the “doomsday” so far out that it’s actually not a cause of concern for those in power?

If not, is it a matter of those numbers are too small or it would never amount to a noticeable difference? Would local (intragalactic) contributions be a much bigger variable anyway?

Basically, I would like to see some data on the infection rates of Flu and RSV between cohorts that recieved an mRNA vaccine for covid and those that did not. Ideally peer reviewed sources, but pre-order review could suffice (I can follow along until the paper is published). It may also be the case that it is too early in the flu season for such research to have been conducted, so I would also be interested in any ongoing studies. Lastly, I'm interested to learn about the methodology used to find these studies.

As I know COVID can be contentious, my agenda is to accrue compelling evidence to disprove my family member's assertions that rising flu and RSV infections are caused by &quot;the clot shot&quot;.

For transparency, I am double vaxxed and boosted, with another booster on the the way.

If I stand in place, and do a 360 rotation, I'm spinning in place. But once we interpret it as, instead, the world revolving around me, it becomes a problem. Distant galaxies, following that wide arc, have traversed billions of lightyears a second, relative to my rotation. Just centripetal force alone should reduce them to dust. 

So how does relativity of motion reconcile with things rotating?

Text: Both online and in my physics courses I’ve seen two seemingly very different accounts for pressure in a fluid at hydrostatic equilibrium:

· The first posits that pressure is a macroscopic measure of the impacts of fluid particles on a surface submerged in the fluid. It is therefore a function of the temperature of the fluid and its density.

· The second explains pressure by the weight of the volume of fluid above each point. It therefore depends on its density and the depth in the fluid (or the altitude in the case of the atmosphere).

I can’t figure out how the two are related. The first explanation requires no gravity, while the second would imply zero pressure in a zero g environment. What am I missing? Is the first explanation only valid for gases and not liquids? And if so, why?

And on that note, I would also like to ask how the second explanation accounts for pressure being a scalar and not a vector: if it is merely the reaction force which balances the weight of the fluid above (per unit area), then why is it the same along axes perpendicular to the vertical?

Text: If an eath like mass were to magically replace the moon, would we feel it instantly, or is it tied to something like the speed of light? If we could see gravity of extrasolar objects, would they be in their observed or true positions?

Text: There's lots in the news about antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and I'm trying to get a more nuanced understanding of how bacteria develop resistance, and if they ever lose that resistance over time.  I know that, in the world of genetically engineered bacteria, it's hard to keep a trait stable over many generations of bacteria.  If the trait isn't necessary for the bacteria's survival, it often mutates away.  Genetic engineers often tie interesting traits to a separate trait for bacterial resistance, and then expose the bacteria to antibiotics to select (in theory) for just the bacteria that have an intact version of the special trait and the associated resistance.

I'm curious about what happens if you take a bacteria strain, like MRSA, that has evolved a resistance to drugs in the methicillin family, and then culture it in an environment where it's not exposed to any antibiotics.  Does the bacteria lose the resistance over generations?  How long does it take?  If the culture loses resistance over time, and then you expose the culture to methicillin again, does the culture re-gain resistance faster, than, say, a naive strain of S. aureus that's never developed resistance in the first place?  Is inherited resistance forever, or does it require continued exposure to antibiotics to maintain that resistance?  

Also, got any recommendations for good books about bacterial resistance?

Title: Sonnet 21
Type: poem
Text: So is it not with me as with that muse,
 Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,
 Who heaven it self for ornament doth use,
 And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,
 Making a couplement of proud compare
 With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems:
 With April's first-born flowers and all things rare,
 That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
 O let me true in love but truly write,
 And then believe me, my love is as fair,
 As any mother's child, though not so bright
 As those gold candles fixed in heaven's air:
 Let them say more that like of hearsay well,
 I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
