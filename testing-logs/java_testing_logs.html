Text: Has the HIV virus become weaker or less deadly? To clarify, I’m referring to the virus, itself, not the results of advances in treatment and management of HIV and AIDS.

During the height of the AIDS pandemic in the 1980s people would seemingly go from from healthy to HIV+ to AIDS to dead in a matter of years. Today you rarely hear of AIDS-related deaths. Certainly not to the same extent as the 80s and early 90s. 

On the flip side, I know other parts of the world are still struggling with massive HIV outbreaks. Parts of Africa, for one. How do the death rates there compare to the outbreak in the 80s?

It seems that pandemics often have a sort of bell curve where the most deadly strains of a virus eventually lose out to milder strains that don’t usually kill their host which makes it easier to pass onto others. Has that happened with HIV?

Text: I am professor Ilan Marek, (https://ilanmarek.technion.ac.il), one of the best synthetic organic chemists in the world today. I have received accolades every single year from different organizations and different countries (the last one being the Arthur C. Cope Scholar Award from the American Chemical Society, prize which is not frequently awarded to non-American citizens), and have been elected to the French Academy of Sciences in 2017 and to the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities in 2019. I am an editorial board member of a long list of important journals in organic chemistry from different countries and societies. I have educated 44 MSc and PhD students and 43 post-doctoral fellows in my career, 26 are now faculty members in different countries and the rest are occupying important positions in various chemical or pharmaceutical companies.

The world population is rapidly expanding. 2.5 new inhabitants (on average) are born every second. By 2050, our planet is going to be inhabited by 10+ billion people. To maintain and improve the global quality of life while meeting the needs of an expanding world population, the production of food, medicine, consumer, and new technology products must be increased to meet this growing demand. Can the world sustain its growing population in the same way we did up to now, without causing additional ecological damage and further depleting natural resources?

To give just one example of the increasing environmental impact of modern life, in the last 70 years, the production of plastic increased from 1.5 million tons per year in 1950 to 450 million tons per year in 2022. That would be fine if one knew how to handle plastics after usage. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Only 9% of plastic is recycled. In 2020 alone, more than 20 million tons of plastics ended up in the sea, creating a floating mass twice the size of Texas in the Pacific Ocean. If we keep on like this, by 2050 there will be more plastic in the sea than fish. If that's not enough, recent studies found micro particles of plastic in people's blood and lungs.

We are in a situation where drastic changes are needed. To support the needs of the growing population, to maintain and improve the life expectancy and life quality we're taking for granted, we cannot just produce more. We need to produce better.

The answer, I believe, lies in catalysis.

A catalyst is any substance that triggers or speeds up a chemical reaction. Catalysts are crucial for life itself: they control our cells, perform our digestion, form part of our immune systems. Catalysts also make modern life possible: they play key roles in food production, drug and materials manufacturing, energy production and many other fields. It is hard to imagine the world today, or indeed civilized society in general, without the impact of catalysis on all fundamental aspects required for life.

Catalysis stands at the nexus of many disciplines, enabling discoveries that impact areas as diverse as health (e.g., medicine, imaging), food (agrichemicals), energy (efficiency, storage, sustainable manufacturing) and more, and as such, forms an important part of the global economy. It is generally associated with underpinning approximately 30% of global GDP, representing roughly 3 trillion USD, and is involved at some point in the processing of 90% of all manufactured products.

To answer these crucial problems, The Technion has created the Resnick Sustainability Center for
Catalysis - the first of its kind in Israel and one of only a handful of similar projects
worldwide - embodies a compelling vision: Innovation in catalysis is key to solving many of the great challenges facing us today. The goal of the Center is to discover and develop new catalysts touching many different fields. This will be achieved by harnessing the Technion's stellar resources in chemistry, biotechnology, physics, biology, computer science, chemical engineering, materials engineering and food engineering - all within a single facility. The Center will serve as an incubator for talent, ideas and solutions, not only strengthening the Technion's reputation as a world leader in this area but also potentially ensuring that the Israeli economy benefits from the improved industrial processes and a lucrative set of exportable technologies that will result from their implementation.

In contrast to the traditional laboratory setup - in which researchers work in isolation from each other - The Resnick Sustainability Center for Catalysis will feature an innovative open space research laboratory model, providing lab space for new faculty members and their teams. There are several reasons for this approach: to enhance multidisciplinary collaboration in a field that is evolving ever more rapidly, to pool the use of advanced pieces of equipment among multiple researchers, and to encourage researchers from two or more academic disciplines to combine their expertise to solve major problems in the field. The Technion believes that the pace of innovation and discovery made possible by this open-space laboratory setup is likely to exceed the pace expected from a conventional lab arrangement.

I will be here to answer your questions at **9am PT (12 PM ET, 16 UT)**, ask me anything!

I was wondering just how those are made suitable for attaching to the body, especially in burn cases where the body is extremely prone to infection.

In a normal orbit you gain speed as you approach periapsis, then that speed flings you back out to apoapsis. I don't see any reason this wouldn't apply in the event horizon of a black hole.

If low-power magnification does benefit them more than the average person, will their better-than-average vision mean they also experience a greater benefit from higher magnification optical tools?

I'm only asking about tools focused on magnification of objects and not, say, corrective lenses for farsightedness/hyperopia that a person with above-average visual acuity might need.

After this the Corp of Engineers built hundreds of lakes to create reservoirs, and I was once told adding all these lakes actually changed the climate of Texas over many decades from a desert to what it is today. However, I have been unable to find any specific research that talks specifically about how the humidity has risen by x%, rainfall increased by x%, etc…

Text: So  I look up in the sky and I see a star. Maybe the star is close to where  I am looking, but the light has been slightly warped because of  gravitation lensing from another star.

But  how do I - or maybe an astronomer - know that the physical location of  the star it isn't on the other side of the horizon from where I am  looking? Isn't it possible I am actually looking at a black hole and the  starlight has been warped enough so that I see it, but it isn't  anywhere close to where I am looking?

As  an analogy, I am sitting in the stands at a football stadium and I am  staring at the 50 yard line, but I see the uprights and goalpost because  there is a black hole on the 49 yard line (oops) that is  deflecting/warping the light by 90 degrees and toward my eyes.

Text: I ask because I know that most extant birds (either flying or flightless) are omnivores.

I also know that the only two extant birds species that are obligate herbivores are the unique hoatzin and the strange kakapo, one is a poor flyer, the other is really flightless, but a great climber.

Formerly, there were nonmarine carnivorous flightless birds such as phorusrhacids (or terror birds, if you want), and the mysterious Jamaican caracara (these two examples are both australavians like the kakapo, but the former is related to seriamas, and the latter was technically the world's only flightless species from the order Falconiformes). Since they are all dead, the only living carnivorous birds are the famous penguins, and the critically endangered flightless cormorant. Both penguins and cormorants are marine obligate carnivores.

However, I think there still could be an extant nonmarine carnivorous flightless bird: the kagu (this species is exclusively found in New-Caledonia, which is part of the Fifth French Republic).

Yes, I am aware that mild paralysis occurs with compression, but this tends to occur later. Also, by &quot;compression&quot;, I meant like when your arm, thigh, etc., is squished, not like carpal-tunnel-like nerve compression.

Text: These chemicals in your blood may cause autism (#7 will surprise you!)

If you are in the USA, there is a 70-80% chance you have pyrethroid pesticide metabolites in your blood right now. If you have a can of bug spray, they are likely in it. If someone sprays for insects in your apartment or home, this is likely what they are spraying. If you are in an area where they fog for mosquitoes, this is what they are spraying. It is used in landscaping in public green spaces and businesses. These pesticides are everywhere - and for good reason. They are considered completely safe for adults.

And yet, multiple recent studies have shown that exposure to pyrethroid class pesticides during pregnancy, or even just having them used within a mile of your house, is a risk factor for autism and neurodevelopmental disorders in the unborn child.

In my research, published today in the journal PNAS Nexus, we exposed three separate cohorts of pregnant mice to a &quot;safe&quot; low dose of the pyrethroid deltamethrin during pregnancy and lactation, then we examined the offspring. All three cohorts of offspring had hyperactivity, reduced vocalizations, increased repetitive behaviors, failed basic learning tests, and had wide ranging disruptions in the dopamine system in the brain. All symptoms which, in humans, are related to autism and neurodevelopmental disorders.

I am happy to answer all your questions! I will be on today at 12pm US EST (16 UT) until at least 5pm (21 UT). AMA!

Text: Typically when I find a bug in my home I pick it up and place it outside.  Problem is I'm moving soon to around the 50th floor of a building.  Can I safely toss a bug off my future balcony or will this mean certain death?  This question includes spiders that don't have wings.  I've done this with crickets from the 20th floor but some seemed to simply accept their fate and just drop straight to the ground which was not expected.  I do know small animals like mice have a terminal velocity that makes such falls non-fatal which is why I'm thinking it applies to most if not all bugs as well.

Text: So we hopefully know that people can carry some genetic mutation as a heterozygote and have minimal (or no) symptoms, but potential offspring who are homozygous will then show the associated disease with worse symptoms, this is common. But I wonder if there are examples of genetic diseases where the heterozygous condition is actually more severe than the homozygote? Say if a single mutant allele incorrectly activates some pathway relative to wild type, whereas in the homozygote this creates such a large change that the cell responds and the net effect is minimal? Or if two different protein variants interfere with each others’ function, whereas again this potentially does not occur in the wt or homozygote? This could be a loss of function or gain of function effect on the protein. I am not thinking about sex linked genes, only autosomal, or compound mutants where the other allele is affected by a second variant.

Normally we use probabilities when we don't have all the information or computing power necessary to make exact calculations like the probability that a certain sports team will win their next game. In theory if we had all the relevant information we would be able to predict the outcome of the game with certainty. Is quantum mechanics seen as probabilistic because we can't have all the information in practice due to the uncertainty principle, or is there a deeper reason?

Text: When we were learning about the equilibrium constant, someone mentioned that it could just arbitrarily be changed by changing the values of the balanced equation. As an example, the equilibrium constant expression for the Haber process would be 

(([NH3]^(2))/([H2]^(3) x ([N2]) 

And assuming the concentration of ammonia is 1, hydrogen is 2, and nitrogen is 2, the equilibrium constant becomes 0.062. 

But since it’s just a stoichiometric relationship, the balanced equation 

2N2 + 6H2 —&gt; 4NH3 

Is valid too. So therefore, the equilibrium constant expression could also be written as 

(([NH3]^(4))/([H2]^(6) x ([N2]^2)

Assuming the same concentration values as before, this would give us a value of 0.003. 

So what is the point of having this equilibrium constant expression if it can just be arbitrarily changed, even though the ratio of moles for each molecule is the same? Do we always need to reduce to the lowest ratio, or is any ratio fine? Which ratio is “acceptable” or “best practice?” Our teacher made none of this clear—even after asking him, so I’m still quite confused.

To be more precise, the middle of the rod is touching my shoulder at t0, and the middle of the rod is exactly 1km away from that point at t1.

Text: So I'm aware that, most notably, humans and cows suffer quite a debilitating condition if they partake in cannibalism, as Kuru and mad cow disease from prion infection.

But, I do see many other animals ranging from mammals, birds, and arthropods engage in cannibalism, even eating their own offspring. Are they also exposed to risks like prion diseases?

And, what exactly is the &quot;norm&quot;?  Is it more common to not be affected?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thank you all for the responses. I believe I misspoke when I brought up Kuru and MCD, as I was just trying to find a more... tangible disease than just &quot;the jitters&quot; that I'm familiar with. Most of the videos I've watched on the subject seemed to imply that cannibalism in any capacity will eventually cause some sort of extremely debilitating disease/condition, and was not aware how specific those two examples actually were.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, I am still quite confused on the actual chain of events when cannibalism occurs (without prior infection like Kuru and MCD), for species that are affected negatively.

Text: Something like how much of a chemical (lead, PFAS, acetaminophen, malathion, etc) on a daily basis, will eventually raise your risk of the associated serious health issue (neurological damage, compromised immune system, liver damage, etc.) significantly above the background level, over the course of your lifetime.

Bruce Ames (father of the Ames test for mutagenicity) advocated for the idea of &quot;Carcinogenic Potency&quot; in weighting health risks of different chemicals.  This takes into account both the mutagenicity and the level of exposure:  alcohol is only slightly mutagenic, but taking into account the much higher amount typically consumed, it was the the most potent carcinogen outside of smoking in his analysis.  But that's just for cancer.  

Now we are considering limiting PFAS in drinking water to 4 parts per trillion.  But the FDA already allows up to 8 ppm of the pesticide, Malathion, in some foods: 6 orders of magnitude more.  Does that really reflect the difference in risk?

When the baby was born she was given a clean bill of health physically. No abnormalities. If anyone is concerned, the baby is currently in foster care since my sister is not currently fit to parent. 

My concern is with the brain. Her body seems okay, but how likely is it she could face mental issues? 

And if certain mental disorders already run in the family (adhd, addiction, bipolar, learning disabilities) how likely is it that drug use during development has increased the likelihood? Or could drugs have increased the possible severity?

Also, could there be abnormalities in the body that weren’t detected? Like could an organ have developed wrong and we won’t know until she’s older?

Text: Hello! Complete science dunce here. I tried to find an article explaining but they all use terms I don't understand, so I figured I would come to ask people who know what they are talking about for a more helpful answer. 

I am reading one of Stephen Hawking's books and, as a complete airhead when it comes to physics and science I am struggling with the concepts. I turned to a youtube video to try and figure out what gravitational relativity was. I think I grasp most of it from the explanation and diagrams, but the one thing I can't wrap my head around is the section on Mercury.

It is said that the precession of Mercury proved Einstein's curved space theory using the equation. Now, obviously, the equation is complete nonsense to me and so that could be why I can't see the connection, but if it's something physical ('the curvature does xyz to Mercury which causes the precession!' etc) then please could someone explain?

TL;DR: Please explain how the unusual orbit of Mercury proves Einstein's curvature theory, but do it as though you're talking to an idiot.

Text: I'm a pescatarian, so I eat a lot of seafood. Of course, most seafood contains mercury thanks to methylmercury absorption by plankton/fish which are subsequently eaten by predatory fish (bioaccumulation). Most of the time, the mercury content won't have an impact on humans. However, humans start suffering from the mercury content once they consume too many &quot;apex fish predators&quot; (sharks, baraccuda, tuna, etc).

Those predatory fish, especially sharks, don't suffer from mercury poisoning despite their high mercury consumption. 

I know our biology isn't the same as fish, but why is it that we can't build up a resistance to mercury (or other heavy metals) to the same degree as predatory fish? I've heard it might be possible (the Japanese have been eating seafood heavy diets for tens of thousands of years), but it seems as if we can only &quot;evolve&quot; so much in this regard. I'd imagine if anyone could build up an exceptional tolerance, it would probably be East Asians or Polynesians  considering they've been eating predatory fish for longer than anyone else...but their mercury tolerance doesn't seem that much higher than anyone else's.

Spines, rib cages, etc. Mammals all share the structure with variations; horses, for example, traded tactile digits for stumpy legs, using the framework for claws to produce hooves, but retaining the same basic bones and joints. Even reptiles, amphibians, and birds share the same components.

How far back does one need to look to find a common ancestor that first developed this basic skeleton shape? Why was this the shape that stuck among most vertebrate creatures, and what prompted bones to develop among *boneless* life to begin with?

Text: As a satellite orbits a planet (really, any massive body), does it need to rotate in order to stay oriented toward the planet's surface? For example, to keep its camera pointed at the ground.

I think this is probably a frame of reference thing, but it's really pushing the limits of my intuition.

Obviously, if one were to observe the orbit from a &quot;top-down&quot; perspective, the satellite would appear to be rotating, but is that still true from the satellite's perspective? If space time is curved, perhaps it's really travelling more or less &quot;laterally&quot; the whole time.

Maybe a different way to approach the question is, if the planet suddenly vanished, the satellite would be released on a straight trajectory like a stone from a slingshot, but would it be spinning?

Would having to rely more on your right hemisphere for your source of sound make you more creative in that case?

Text: Hi,

I have a neurobiology course, and I have a doubt about something my teacher wrote in the syllabus of the course.

It  says that ions can circulate through the membrane of a neuron via  receptors, and that there is two major factors influencing the  circulation of ions : 1) an electrical force, due to the eletric  potential difference between the outside and the inside of the cell. 2) a  &quot;chemical force&quot; (sic) due to the difference in ions concentration,  &quot;also called osmotic force&quot;.

I have 3 questions :

1. is the concept of &quot;chemical force&quot; a valid one ?
2. most  importantly, I'm note very qualified in chemistry, but it seems to me  that osmotic pressure is by definition related to the circulation of a  solvent through a semi-permeable membrane... here the ions are the  solute if I'm not wrong... so how can osmotic pressure have something to  do with this ?
3. the explanations of my teacher, are they &quot;okay&quot; simplification, or are they simply false ?

Looking forward to reading you,

So my question is if a woman took the pill continually such that she doesn't have a period would that cause her also not to release eggs and in doing so cause her eggs to last  longer and thus menopause to be delayed by the number of years she was continually on the pill. 

If so could a woman perhaps do so for 10 to 15 years resulting in menopause occurring in her 60 to mid 60s rather than 50s when she is still working.

Text: I’m not just talking about size- like their actual physiology and nutrients on a cellular level. (Apologies in advance if none of what I’m about to say makes sense, I know very very little about biology lol, i’m just trying to learn more :)

So say you have two tiger cubs. Both the same size. You feed them each the same quantity of meat every day (progressively they both get more as they grow etc.) You feed them cows. But one gets 6 KG worth of Runt cow meat, and one gets 6 KG worth of cow meat from ONLY the biggest cows in the herd (but both the runt and big cow are the same age!) Is there an actual different between the quality of meat? And will one tiger grow up to be stronger/healthier because of the meat’s quality?

Again, maybe something in this example doesn’t make sense, sorry about that. 
An example with humans is that someone eats 0.1 kg of bananas that are small, and someone else eats 0.1 kg of bananas that are gigantic. But both bananas came from the same place and were the same age.

And continuing on that, what about an animal with a genetic deformity? If you eat a cow that was born with brain damage, but you only eat the thighs, is there still a noticeable difference? Or how about a cow with muscular dystrophy? Or a cow with some sort of nervous system disorder? Not like a disease, just a defect.

If you have a single atom of uranium suspended in water at the right pressure and temperature for it to be solid, is it a solid? Is there anything that differentiates it from a single atom of the same material in space, heated to the point where it could be a liquid or gas in the presence of other uranium atoms?

Plasma seems intuitive because you are stripping pieces of the atom away, but what about the three basic phases?

To get these glycoalkaloids extracted, I have to dry them up however, I had the option to do air drying but the time to do that is not already feasible so I decided to try oven drying. I was wondering if oven-drying might potentially damage the significant amount of glycoalkaloid present in the plant sample or it bares no difference from a fresh sample. All I know so far oven-drying can at least prevent the sample from getting rotten due to moisture content though, not so much about whether it does reduce the phytochemicals when placed it under oven-drying. 

Also, if oven-drying does seem helpful. Is it a general rule to have it done in just days, coz I'm curious of having in a week but that might give erroneous result if I overdo it (not risking coz I'm being tight in time and budget for undergrad.)

Text: The reasoning behind my question is based on the idea that charge is compressible.

Water is often used to describe electric current but it seems like gas is more fitting.

Say you had two parcels of air with differing parts per million of some particulate but same volume.(let's say they are in balloons to prevent dissipation)

both could be traveling the same speed relative to the ground although the parts per second would be higher for the higher ppm parcel.

Higher voltage is a higher ratio of joules per coulomb

Higher current is more coulombs per second

Higher Power is more joules per second

Am I right in thinking more energy per charge and more charge per second is achieved through higher charge density rather than electrons moving faster though space?

Text: Human hearts have two halves, one to pump blood around the lungs and another to pump blood around the rest of the body. Ok, makes sense, the oxygenation step is very important and there's a lot of tiny blood vessels to push blood through so a dedicated pumping section for the lungs seems logical.

But why are there two chambers per side? An atrium and a ventricle. The explanation we got in school is that the atrium pumps blood into the ventricle which then pumps it out of the heart. So the left ventricle can pump blood throughout the entire body and the left atrium only needs to pump blood *down* a couple of centimeters? That seems a bit uneven in terms of capabilities. 

Do we even need atria? Can't the blood returning from the body/lungs go straight into the ventricles and skip the extra step of going into an atrium that pumps it just a couple of centimeters further on?

Say you take a pipe, fill it with water, cap the ends (kinda like a pipe-bomb) and throw it into the fire. Thermal energy will transfer from the heat of the fire to the pipe, to the water, causing it to boil and eventually explode when water turned to steam.

Now take the same pipe, fill with water and submerge it in liquid nitrogen.  Water will freeze, expanding it and do nearly exact same thing; exploding it..

Question is, if the fire is providing thermal energy to the water to explode it, but energy is leaving the water as it freezes, where is the energy coming from that bursts the pipe?

Operating in Belize, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico, we track the health of the reefs in the area and evaluate each country's reef management efforts. I have a PhD in Marine Science from the University of South Florida and have also worked for the World Wildlife Fund and the Smithsonian Institution. I'm the author of more than 40 peer-reviewed research papers and the recipient of the 2021 Conservation Award from the International Coral Reef Society.

In 2013, an uncharted coral reef was discovered off the coast of Belize and Guatemala - but was kept rather secret until this year. Dubbed &quot;The Cayman Crown,&quot; this reef surpasses the size of Manhattan and is a refuge for a vast array of marine life, from schools of yellow jack and blue tang to bottlenose dolphins to the critically endangered - and commercially important - Nassau grouper. While not wholly immune to the dangers that face other reefs, such as overfishing, bleaching and invasive species, this reef's remarkable resilience is likely due to its position on the edge of the Cayman Trench. The hope is that this discovery can mark a new chapter in understanding corals and in saving coral reefs worldwide.

The Cayman Crown was given protected status in 2020 by both Belize and Guatemala, but there is still much to be done to ensure its conservation. You can learn more and see the first-ever footage of the reef in the new PBS *Nature* documentary &quot;[Treasure of the Caribbean](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/about-treasure-caribbean/28747/),&quot; now available to stream in the US.

I'll be answering your questions at 1 pm ET (17 UT). Ask me anything!

Text: Black holes are a product of density, and not necessarily mass alone. As a result, [“scientists think the smallest black holes are as small as just one atom”](https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what-is-a-black-hole-k4.html). 

What is the mass required to achieve an atom sized black hole? How do multiple atoms even fit in the space of a single atom? If the universe was peppered with “supermicro” black holes, then would we be able to detect them?

Also, to alleviate any confusion, my question was referring to fossils that are millions of years old and not those young enough to be dated by using carbon-14.

How does every fossil we find contain enough radioactive nuclei and their daughter isotopes to accurately date? I was under the impression that elements like uranium are in general rare on earth and only present in significant quantities when they're concentrated by geologic processes over done. How do ordinary sedimentary rocks containing fossils contain enough to actually date?

Were self-serve buffets a worse place for viral transmission than other restaurants? Especially when compared/contrasted with places like Chipotle, which also has people in close proximity, but does not have people touching serving tools and probably much less ability to cough towards food.

It seems that initial-to-middle of the pandemic reporting indicated that Covid transmission via food itself was extremely unlikely. Transmission via serving tools, like tongs, could certainly happen, but transmission through the air via aerosolized particles was still the biggest threat.

Text: I've been doing some work on personal trauma recently, and I'm curious about how the body responds to these sort of things. Food can often bring up a lot of memories (smell being a powerful sense, of course).

Specifically, I remember having porridge a lot for breakfast as a child - pretty robust breakfast I suppose, with carbs, fibre and some protein. I've not had it in a long time, but had it again more recently and felt I'd been hanging on to more weight than usual, when I look at the scales.

Given childhood, in my case, was often filled with a myriad of stress-inducing situations, including fast-paced mornings where breakfast was often eaten quickly, I wondered if there's any link between specific foods (more than just nutritional connections, like carbs, etc.) and the circumstances in which we first had it that might contribute to how we process foods, excluding potential factors like speed of eating (I understand that can affect these things also)?

Could the stressful situation of childhood breakfast times that perhaps triggers some evolutionary mechanism in my body that thinks it would be better to process certain foods in different ways?

I.e., body thinks something is in trouble in stressful situation, decides that circumstances might be difficult, decides to put food into fat storage for resources, situation repeats and food becomes associated with particular mode of processing.

This could be absolute nonsense, but I wondered if there might be any robust scientific literature on this based on my own limited understanding of ourselves, even if it disproves this. Given how complex our body is though, and the connections it can make between particular things related to trauma, it's a question that sounds interesting to explore.

I suppose it might be referred to as a psychosomatic connection - I've heard that term thrown around, but happy to be corrected on that.

When the laser beam is parallel to the c-axis it is simple, but when I start to rotate the c-axis of the crystal the surface has an angle to the laser beam which is not 90 degree, therefore the laser beam is not perpendicular to the surface of the crystal. I think there is other solution than just polish everytime perpendicular surfaces to the laser beam. In raman spectroscopy how is it possible to solve this problem and measure the Raman spectra of different angles?

Can we use paleoclimate to presume that Neanderthals were working mammoth leather into boots to travel in the snow 120,000 years ago, perhaps 400,000 years? There is a flute from 60,000 years ago, and it's more useful and easy to craft a shoe than a flute.

Can we suggest that Neanderthals excursions north are evidence of human's first technological ability to live in the cold with clothes, and homo-habilis too because his flint tooling was as technical as clothesmaking?

Is the progressively northward range of humans evidence for boot technology?

Is this true to some extent? Did the clean air act, which I always thought was an amazing policy because of the wonders it did for our air quality, have the unintended effect of accelerating global warming by boosting the greenhouse effect?

I know if I looked this up, I would only get a bunch of hard to understand research papers, so I am asking it here. Any answers are greatly appreciated.

Text: I have type 1 diabetes and manage my blood glucose with a CGM, pump, and insulin (Novorapid which is supposedly identical to human insulin).

Recently I have been using an APS (artificial pancreas system) which links my CGM and pump together to effectively emulate a healthy human pancreas. This APS system doesn't work perfectly and I often have high glucose after meals and occasionally low glucose (usually due to the absorption speed of meals or exercise).

I don't know any of the technical parts of how the pancreas does its job in managing glucose levels, but I have a good understanding of how to manage my own diabetes regardless. 

My main two questions would be:
1. How does the pancreas prevent (or at least reduce) sudden spikes in glucose after a meal?
2. How does insulin on board not affect healthy people (non diabetics) as much during exercise?

To add to the first question, as a T1 diabetic I need to inject (using a pump) a predetermined amount of insulin based on the total carbohydrates in a meal and this is a very rough estimate because absorption speeds can vary greatly. In a closed loop APS, the only way I've seen people prevent spikes (without knowing the carbs) is having insulin already on board but I don't understand how this would be possible in a healthy human body which isn't warned in advance about food.

To add to the second question, it is often too risky for me to exercise just after a meal because of all the insulin on board. The only method I can think of to reduce the risk of a hypo during exercise is to inject less insulin for the meal, but from the first question I either need to know this in advance or I need to be injecting small increments whenever I see a rise in glucose which would also result in hyperglycaemia.

I suppose I should also mention that CGMs measure glucose from the interstitial fluid, so trends are usually delayed by 10-15 minutes (although I'd assume the current glucose level can be extrapolated).
Also there are faster types of insulin available, such as Fiasp and Lyumjev, but I'd like to focus on why human insulin is still effective without needing these properties.

Thanks for reading!

Text: Say you got some chronic infections, like a parasite/bacteria/virus. It becomes active, then goes dormant again, and repeats. Maybe you don't notice symptoms but the immune system is battling it when it acts up, which likely causes colllateral damage. Let's say you now boost your immune system by healthy habits like exercising, cold showers, healthy food and whatnot. Is it possible for the immune system to fully eradicate a chronic infection because it is now 'capable' somehow of doing things that it previously couldn't? Maybe it detects the dormant guys when before it couldn't? Kinda like how a person with AIDS will catch infections easily, but in reverse.  

**EDIT**: So I feel like many people are misinterpreting a 'boosted' or 'stronger' immune system as one that recklessly attacks everything. That's not what I meant. Stronger refers to 'an increased ability to detect what is and what is not part of the body'. Chronic infections are allowed to exist because the body doesn't recognize that the infection is not supposed to be there. Making the system stronger is meant as saying, making the system being able to recognize these pathogens better, so they can be removed.

Text: I hear about so many turning down the vaccine, for the record, I'm pro vaccine/pro science (weird that I even stated it). The numbers seem to be on the major decline, with some hospitals not even requiring masks anymore. What are the reasons for this? 

My assumption would be the following: 

People actually getting the vaccine in larger numbers than I understand

Herd immunity

Public health measures (masks/social distancing, etc). 

&amp;#x200B;

If those are the reasons the decline took place, what's KEEPING it declined/low?

Text: So with the fun news about mRNA being developed for cancer and heart disease, it made me think about where the limit is with these types of vaccines. For example, I have a very sever allergy to tree nuts and morphine, if I ingest either I need to be at the emergency room in 15-20mins before things get really bad. And it's my understanding that allergies are when you body mistakes something as an intruder in your system and works to purge it. So with these mRNA vaccines, could there be a similar method to train your body to not see, in my example, tree nuts as a danger?

Text: I was watching a documentary about the cultivation of vines in Europe for the manufacture of wine.  In that documentary they mention that there was an insect that attacked European vines because the trees had thinner bark.  However, the plague did not attack American vines because they had the thickest bark.

 From this discovery, they began to cultivate American vines and they put grafts of European vines on them, so they would have a thick skin and they would give European grapes (since the American grapes from this vineyard were not very pleasant to the taste).

 From here my question arises, do plants have defense mechanisms against other plants that may try to take advantage of their nutrients, cells and structures?  Or can they detect when a plant is dominating gene expression to make the bark thicker?  Something like a function similar to what the Major Histocompatibility Complex would do in humans, which detects foreign cells and those not typical of our body, rejecting these grafts.

Text: I have seen a few videos recently of volcanos erupting. It is my understanding that volcanic eruptions can cause a VERY slight cooling effect on the earth because of the chemicals they shoot into the atmosphere and the amounts of them. But I’m wondering about something a little more abstract. 

If the surface temperature of the earth is increasing, even slightly, due to the many factors that contribute to it, would the core of the earth also be increasing in heat? If so, Is there any way to know what 1 degree Celsius increase of surface temp would equate to in terms of the core of the earths temperature rising? Or is this concept fundamentally wrong?

If it’s not wrong, could an increase in the earths core temperature increase the frequency of volcanic eruptions, ultimately leading to more global “cooling” due to the effect of volcanic eruptions?

Text: The first months of 2023 have seen reports of outbreaks of Marburg virus from several countries in East Africa. Closely related to Ebola virus, Marburg is highly contagious and incredibly virulent, spreads through direct contact, and has no known treatment. How worried should we be about the spread of Marburg virus disease?

Join us today between 12 and 4 PM ET for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology, to look at the known biological, clinical and epidemiological aspects of the Marburg virus. We'll answer questions about the current state of research into the virus, give updates on progress into potential treatments and cures, share steps that can (and should) be taken to contain the ongoing outbreaks, and discuss broad strategies that can help prevent future zoonotic disease spillovers.

Ask us anything!

Text: I remember my teacher explaining that greenhouses keep the environment inside them warm because glass lets most visible light in but no infrared out, making new heat, and that's also what CO2 and lots of other gasses do, hence the greenhouse effect we all know and love.

However, some people say that this theory is outdated and infrared has nothing to do with it, but instead greenhouses work by limiting air exchange, so if you keep the same air in the same sun-exposed enclosure for a long time it's going to get warmer simply because it can't mix with outside air. So no new heat is made, it's just trapped in place, and therefore the term &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; as applied to the earth's atmosphere is a misnomer.

So who's right?

Text: Have only ever seen Milankovich cycles tied to Tertiary (esp Quaternary) paleoclimate stuff, and tentatively to Cretaceous sedimentation. Was just wondering if it is relevant as far back as the Carboniferous and could explain the cyclothems making up many of the important coal measures from that period.

Or is that a bit like the delayed fungal evolution thing in that it is over-reaching for a needless solution?

Text: I understand that your body can adapt to harmful substances such as poison and become immune, for example, I know a story about a king of ancient times who took small sips of poison every so often to develop immunity, and one day he tried to take his life because they were going to overthrow him and he could not because the poison had no effect on him (lmao).

so my question is why is it possible to become immune to some things like the poison of a rattlesnake, and not to others like for example mercury.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it because venom is a biological composition of proteins and complex molecules and the body can learn to &quot;dismantle&quot; it and mercury is a simple metal?

&amp;#x200B;

but if that is why the body handles other metals as well, such as iron or zinc, calcium or gold in small quantities.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not trying to be a superhero, I'm just curious.

Title: Question: Can cellulose fibers (Claire, 2023), be impregnated and coated with a metallic-matrix-infused polymer coating to increase conductivity and reduce flammability? (Additional details and Sources in the Post)

Text:   

Hello,

I came across this article today (it was a busy weekend) and wanted some opinions on some thoughts inspired by it. The article is from Tyson (2023), which details an experiment that showed wood (altered) can be used to conduct electricity (Tran et al., 2023; Tyson, 2023). Tran et al. 2023, imply (to me) that the outcome was essentially a cellulose product that can be impregnated with a polymer to help conduct electricity and likely reduce the flammability. However, if I understand (Salmeia et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019) correctly; given the assumption that if heat can be used to create energy (Chu,2018), the opposite is true; and if that is the case heat is likely to be a byproduct from electricity (assumption based on energy loss/entropy). 

So, my initial question is: 

If Tyson (2023) and Tran et al. (2023) allow for a cellulose material  (impregnated in a polymer) that improves conductivity (and likely reduces flammability), and some concerns are conductivity of cellulose and the flammability (Salmeia et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019). An additional factor is an ability to create flame-retardant cellulose fibers better (Claire, 2023; Salmeia et al., 2016) and potentially combine them with the properties allocated (in this posting) to Tran et al., 2023. Primarily the impregnation and coating of the material with a polymer to increase conductivity and assumedly to reduce flammability (Chu, 2018; Salmeia et al., 2016; Tran et al., 2023; Tyson, 2023; Zhang et al., 2019). Could a layer of conductive metals, silver (Tran et al., 2023) or a silver and superalloy mixture (Sands, 2022; T. Smith, 2022; T. M. Smith et al., 2023); with an outer coating of the polymer that also incorporates a matrix structure (within the polymer) to facilitate conductivity better (Pan et al., 2022) comprised of the metals used, increase conductivity, and additively decrease flammability?

Additional Questions: Could the cellulose fibers (flame retardant) be created to include a matrix of metal fibers (second option) within its structure and be subsequently impregnated and further coated, as inquired about above?

   Thanks for any help or responses; I was trying to de-stress and grow (or correct my knowledge base). Have a Good Day!!

Text: Since Feb 2022 Omicron has been the dominant variant, accounting for over 98% of sequences, [according to the WHO](https://www.who.int/news/item/16-03-2023-statement-on-the-update-of-who-s-working-definitions-and-tracking-system-for-sars-cov-2-variants-of-concern-and-variants-of-interest). OurWorldInData [paints a similar picture](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2020-03-01..latest&amp;facet=none&amp;country=USA~GBR~CAN~DEU~ITA~IND&amp;pickerSort=asc&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;Metric=Variants&amp;Interval=7-day+rolling+average&amp;Relative+to+Population=true&amp;Color+by+test+positivity=false). The table even shows 0% on all variants prior to Omicron in all countries as of Jun 2023. So have previous variants simply &quot;died off&quot;?

The usual explanation for this is that &quot;virus evolve&quot; and that Omicron is better at evading immune response, see the aforementioned WHO link. Although this may account for Omicron's success, it does not seem to account for the apparent demise of previous variants. Vaccination could explain it, but while it reduces the risk of transmission it does not eliminate it, so shouldn't the spread of previous variants be roughly proportional to the reduced transmission risk, instead of zero? Finally, if previous variants have indeed &quot;died off&quot; and vaccination *was* the answer, are vaccines targeting anything but Omicron still relevant?

Text: In one episode of the series the protagonist, Legasov, explains the function of the safety protocol AZ5 that forces the boron control rods to descend into the reactor. That boron rods slows reactivity but he elaborates that the control rods are tipped with graphite which accelerates reactivity. The character opposite him in this scene asks &quot;Why?&quot; the control rods are tipped with graphite. He explains that it's &quot;cheaper&quot;, but I find that explaination unsatisfying.

It sounds to me like a fireman explaining that the first few bursts from a fire extinguisher will dispense jet fuel before any kind of flame retardant.

Why would the control rods in this reactor be tipped with an accelerant of all things?

I live in the Eastern United States at the moment and we haven’t seen rain in about a month, is the lack of precipitation making us more susceptible? Is lack of rain also an effect of climate change? If so how?

Text: Hi Reddit! We're Ruby Leung, Mark Wigmosta, and Andre Coleman from the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). We're here today to discuss [our scientific approach to tackling wildfires](https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/taming-tomorrows-wildfires), an issue that has become increasingly prominent, particularly in the Western United States.

As the wildfire seasons seem to extend and intensify each year, our team and fellow researchers are diligently working on predicting, preventing, and mitigating these disasters. From predicting the occurrence and direction of big blazes to implementing strategies to prevent future fires, our team is leveraging a broad spectrum of scientific perspectives to combat wildfires.

One of our tools, [the RADR-Fire satellite system](https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/rapid-analytics-disaster-response), led by Andre Coleman, helps firefighting personnel, utilities operators, and other decision makers better understand a fire's behavior so they can make informed choices in the midst of natural disaster. It also aids utility operators assess risk by identifying areas prone to wildfire and which energy infrastructure needs protection.

On the preventative side, Mark Wigmosta and team have developed a new tool with the U.S. Forest Service to determine where controlled burns or thinning would be most effective in reducing fire hazards. Such measures have been found to potentially reduce fire hazards by 25-96 percent in certain cases, and also yield benefits like reduced smoke and increased streamflow.

Meanwhile, Ruby Leung is leading a team in creating models that consider an expanded list of &quot;wildfire predictors,&quot; delivering a more complete picture of how likely it is that a fire strikes, how far it burns, and how much smoke it releases into the atmosphere.

Our collective work is helping us get an edge on tomorrow's wildfires, making utilities more resilient to natural disasters, and increasing our understanding of fire behavior in response to climate change. We're here today to discuss our research, the scientific principles behind it, and how we see it impacting the future of wildfire management.

We'll be on at **8am pacific (11 AM ET, 15 UT)**, ask us anything!

Text: I read somewhere that the higher the IQ the more you are likely to be creative and the people with lower IQs do not show the same ability in creativity. Then another source, this one a more recent study, said that IQ and creativity is linked, but at a certain point (around 120 IQ), there stopped being a correlation. I'm curious about this since there are existed highly creative people with high IQs, then there was people who with average and even below average IQs that showed same levels of creativity.

Is there a correlation? Is there a breakpoint at some level and it depends more on other factors?

* How large would a city need to be for crows to take roost?
* The village in-question is cut into the side of a grand canyon-esque cliff and surrounded by 180 degrees of forest at its base; does there need to be an urban city on the cliff's edge above this village in order to attract crows in the first place, or will they roost in any place where humans gather and build structures?

Thank you for your insight!

Text: In April 2023, [Reddit announced they would begin charging for its application programming interface (API)
access](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/18/technology/reddit-ai-openai-google.html).

API is used to allow different applications to interact with each other. We are a heavily moderated subreddit, and we use API access for moderation, AMA organisation, and insights into our community. We are using community-driven tools which use the API in order to make management of a community as large as /r/askscience practical for our group of volunteer moderators.

At the same time, we recognise both Reddit's mission as a corporation, as well as the dangers and risks arising from access to the API. Reddit is looking for ways to [monetize its user-generated content](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/upcoming-reddit-blackout-and-future-third-party-applications); the Times article linked above notes has been used to train high-profile machine learning models like OpenAI's.

While Reddit administration has mentioned [free access for moderation tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/141oqn8/api_updates_questions/), we believe their current approach of gatekeeping access based on arbitrary and indiscriminate rate limiting has several shortcomings:  
It disproportionately impacts people who use Reddit with accommodations, such as screen readers: Reddit has stated that [accessibility-focused apps will be exempt from the new restrictions](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/08/reddit-makes-an-exception-for-accessibility-apps-under-new-api-terms/) but has offered little clarity on what that means for this rapidly-approaching change  
It does not reflect Reddit’s promise to [support moderation
  tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/141oqn8/api_updates_questions/)  
It does not establish clear and concise criteria for what is legitimate API usage  

We also remain cognisant of Reddit’s past promises to [improve communication with
moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cbo4m/we_apologize/) and build tools for us to improve search and combat hateful rhetoric, anti-vaccination, and COVID denialism. While Reddit has banned hate speech and banned communities spreading science denialism, we feel they have not delivered on moderation tools and support. We feel that 3rd-party tools still offer superior support for moderation as well as accessibility features.

Everyone in the /r/askscience community contributes to its quality and longevity by volunteering their time and expertise to question, answer, and moderate scientific discussion. We feel the Reddit administration does a disservice our passion for large-scale, high-quality science communication by [pursuing a unilateral and opaque
direction](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/). This damages our community and ultimately Reddit itself by severing the trust we place upon it as a platform for science education and outreach.

Therefore, we have decided to join the protest beginning June 12. During this time, askscience will not be allowing new posts.  We anticipate being offline for 48 hours, and we thank you sincerely for your support and understanding.

Text: I’ve been trying to understand why the sky changes colors, and I think I understand most of it, but something in the online explanations doesn’t make it clear for me:

I’ve read:

- sky is blue because blue light gets scattered the most during the day. 

- in the evening it turns red because now even more of the blue light gets scattered

So a few questions:

1. The scattering of light during the day: does it mean that blue light gets reflected off air particles and reaches our eyes, while the rest of the frequencies pass through and reach the ground?

2. Surely some of the other frequencies also get scattered during the day, just in much smaller amounts?

3. So during the evening blue light gets scattered even more, to the point where even less of it reaches the eyes?

4. And so it gets red because now we can see the lower frequencies being scattered without blue overshadowing them?

5. Trying to word it myself: during the day only the highest frequencies get filtered, but during the evening also lower frequencies get filtered, because now the “light strainer” (air) is just catching more of it?

6. It gets darker in the evening without a good ability to see colors because there’s is no blue and so on light to reflect off of objects?

7. Is it ok to speak about light as a frequency? Or it’s only correct to say “wave length”?

Text: A little googling suggests that the total biomass of the earth has been declining at least since the human age (no surprise), if not much earlier.

Are there good estimates of the time course of Earth's biomass over the planet's history? Did it slowly and continuously ramp up until recently (with, I guess, big dips when an asteroid hit or other mass extinctions occur)? Or is there a plateau that it hit early and generally sustains (quickly re-attaining after mass extinctions)?

Sub-questions:

Are there good estimates of biomass saturation times for subdivisions of life? Like, I guess maybe Bacteria peaked earlier than Eukaryotes, but then got another boost by living with Eukaryotes? When did arthropods saturate? When did vertebrates saturate (have they yet)?

(The dumb shower thought that led to this question: I wonder if, millions of years from now, it will be easier to find fossilized disposable diapers than it is, today, to find fossilized trilobites? How many trilobites were there? Billions, trillions? How many disposable diapers in landfills are there?)

*edit* (hard question, i guess? guess now i'm going for a high upvotes/comments ratio!)

Text: Physics questions related to the speed of light and space travel

I am having difficulty finding answers to a few related questions regarding the speed of light and velocities in space:

Is there a maximum velocity if you have infinite fuel?

Person A measures the speed of light while on earth as ~298,000 km/s. Person B is traveling past earth at half the speed of light. Does person B measure the speed of light at ~149,000 km/s, or 298,000 km/s?

How is speed measured in space if all points of reference are also in constant motion? (Rather than fixed points of reference like here on earth). 

I know these seem like simple Q's, but I think there is more to them than an initial glance may suggest.

Looking forward to the ensuing discussion!

Text: Hello,

I was curious about Antiviral medications.  For instance, there is an antiviral available for HIV now,  ART.  There are also Antivirals for things like Herpes Simplex 1; Acyclovir and others.

Antibiotics, to my understanding, are essentially a nuke.  They kill everything in the infected region.  We don't have that technique available to us for Viruses, though.  

So, I was curious - what are the traits of these Antivirals and what mechanisms do they have that result in successful treatment?  

Are Antivirals creating an environment that is prohibitive towards the Host's virus in their system, causing them to not duplicate or fail to do so?

And one more on the same topic - Are they basically the same medication, but just used in different quantities?  For instance, would ART also treat Herpes Simplex 1, Simplex 2, etc?  

Or are they entirely different in their form and function to treat other viruses?

Thank you for your time

Text: I've been hearing a lot about &quot;colonial organisms&quot; and how cool they are because &quot;Oh, it's like an animal made up of lots of tiny animals.&quot; And I don't understand, isn't that EVERY animal?

Colonial animals are made up of  &quot;zooids&quot;. A zooid is a multicellular, individual organism but each zooid has a specialized function and could not survive were it to be separated from the colony. 

Isn't that exactly what an organ is? An organ is a multicellular, self-contained entity within an animal. An organ performs a specialized function within the body. An organ could not survive were it to be separated from the main body. 

So what distinguishes the two? Is it because colonial organism don't have brains so their organs are said to act independently?

Text: I believe there is a quality benefit in that I'm told that cooking many foods makes them easier to digest (how much easier?) and I'm aware that it is safer, meat in particular, to subject foods to enough heat to kill harmful bacteria. 

What I'm interested in is whether there is a nutritional benefit. It seems plausible that cooking could actually harm nutrients, but is there a nutritional benefit that makes up for this?

Follow-up if nutrtion profile does not change: If I have the nutritional data for a food by weight, and I cook the food, it will have less weight. Will the resulting food have the same nutrition as the uncooked food I start with (is the weight loss only water?)

I started thinking about this while being pitched a raw food diet for my dog. The premise doesn't make sense to me for the same reason that dog owners who feed their dogs raw meet likely aren't eating raw meat themselves, but the claim is that it has a health benefit for the dog and I have no knowledge of that but am thinking that if it does, surely it would apply to humans as well.

Apologies if I have the wrong flair or have asked in the wrong forum. Seems like a biology question fundamentally.

Text: Hi, I hope this is the right category for a paleoclimate question.

There are various reconstructions of past global temperatures based on geological proxy evidence. There are some reconstructions going back 540 million years, though they get less certain as they go further back in time.

But it would be really interesting to know how the Snowball Earth events compared to later temperatures. And what the temperatures were like generally during the Proterozoic and Archean. (I already tried Google but couldn't find much.)

I understand there is less evidence for those times. I know they can't use shell isotopes because there were no hard shells. Still, I'm wondering if there has been any work done to figure out how temperature evolved before the Phanerozoic?

Text: Edit: since that stupid show &quot;Ancient Apocalypse&quot; is getting a bunch of attention at the moment, let me be clear the following has NOTHING to do with that. I do not believe there's some advanced lost civilisation, I do not believe in atlantians, I do not believe these sea people came and gave this technology to these people. I just don't understand how ~12k years ago we go from extremely simple building engineering, to Karaahan Tepe. The advancement to Göbekli Tepe a few k years later though makes total sense, you can see the gradual improvements they made from KT to GT, it's linear progress.  But KT appears to suddenly jump into existence, during the younger dryas at that. It just feels to me either I'm missing something deep, or perhaps there could be a chain of similar sites going back 15k, 20k, 30k, etc years (but even then I ask why did it take between ~250k years or ~40k years to figure out the early ones?).

Karahan Tepe, the older sister site of the world famous Göbekli Tepe, appears to be around 12,000 years old.

All of the evidence we have found so far suggests they were hunter gatherers who may have been doing small amounts of agriculture (which is backed up by genetic tracing of our modification of species, which happened over thousands of years). And on top of that did not have pottery.

Of course I've heard that this may imply that it may not have been agriculture that allowed us the time and requirements to build structures like this, but structures like this that allowed us to start agriculture. Or (what I would lean to) is that it was a slow mix of each pushing each other along.

But what I don't understand, is if humans were capable of this back then with essentially pre/minimal-agriculture, then why don't we see any further back?

Why weren't we building these structures 15,000 years ago. Or 30,000? Or 50,000? Or even 100,000?

I understand about the ice age (although some of the PPN sites seemed like they may have developed in the younger dryas, which makes even less sense?). But there were still warmer climates with humans in them.

Why did it take us ~250k years to suddenly figure this out, and then when we do figure it out, we're suddenly pretty damn good at it? Or even if you follow that humans only became behaviourally modem 70k years ago, again why did it take 60k years?

It just doesn't make much sense to me. Humans who could figure out how to make stone weapons, fire, primitive homes, etc, surely absolutely understood that you could chip away and grind away stone.

Is it possible we just haven't found these yet? And that there's just fewer due to lower population? It feels obvious to me that there must be some missing as there's such a jump to the PPN ones.

Or is there a reason humans couldn't/didn't build sites like this. And something suddenly changed?

A major driver of these shocks being delivered throughout the poultry industry has been a series of outbreaks of avian influenza, colloquially referred to as bird flu. Such outbreaks are damaging not only for the poultry industry, but also represent a major health concern due to the potential for zoonotic spillovers. How is the scientific research community working to combat this public health challenge?

Text: When I say &quot;repeat&quot;, I'm not saying that Pi eventually becomes an endless string of &quot;999&quot; or &quot;454545&quot;. What I'm asking is: it is possible at some point that Pi repeats entirely? Let's say theoretically, 10 quadrillion digits into Pi the pattern &quot;31415926535...&quot; appears again and continues for another 10 quadrillion digits until it repeats again. This would make Pi a continuous 10 quadrillion digit long pattern, but a repeating number none the less. 

My understanding of math is not advanced and I'm having a hard time finding an answer to this exact question. My idea is that an infinite string of numbers must repeat at some point. Is this idea possible or not? Is there a way to prove or disprove this?

Text: I'm asking this question because I found the geography around Parker Ranch, the first cattle ranch in the Hawaiian archipelago, to be very peculiar. 

North of Parker Ranch is Mt. Kohala which sports a lush forest. The elevation shift could explain the arid region on the other side of the mountain, however, the edge of the forest on the north side of the island is very geometric, suggesting land management as the culprit. A third option could be a mix of a rain shadow + land management but I'm not sure. Further, there could be other factors I'm not thinking about.

Thoughts?

Text: I read today that polar bears have the best noses of mammals and can smell things up to 18 miles away. How is that calculated? Also how does that work? From my understanding smell is tiny pieces of whatever you’re smelling drifting off of the object and into your nose. I imagine it would have to be very specific circumstances for a smell to travel 18 miles. How fast can smell travel? How does it not get so diffused in the air that even if you could smell it you could pick it out of the background enough to actually do something useful with it.

Bonus question, sharks can smell blood in the water from great distances too, and I would imagine that smells travel much slower in water, so how does that work?

Text: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-67860-3

The official position of the US government is that there is no evidence to support the idea of a causal link between solar activity and seismic activity. However, a paper published in Nature(linked above), demonstrates a statistically significant correlation between the two, with seismic activity picking up reliably after significant solar events. Given our current understanding of elctromagnetic fields within fault lines and large lava chambers, doesn't it stand to reason that massive electromagnetic storms could cause instability within those delicate systems and or precipitate seismic activity? Are geologists pursuing this line of reasoning? Could understanding this relationship help improve our ability to predict seismic and volcanic events?

Text: I presume everyone is used to their own sense of depth, and adjusted to it, and it seems normal to them (because it *is* normal for them). But I've also noticed that stereoscopic images made with a wider parallax result in a 3-D image that appears stretched, deeper, and exaggerated.

It seems this would hold true for someone with more widely set eyes. If I wore specially designed prismatic eyeware that gave each eye a slightly further off-center view than I am used to, would I get the same elongated sense of depth? 

Would this offer an advantage to someone who relies on depth perception, like an NFL quarterback, or MLB pitcher? Would they be able to see more detail with their sense of depth, analogous to stretching out the linear display of a soundtrack, with sound editing software?

Text: So for them to combine into one object they'll have to be perfectly inelastic, so that's the assumption.

Logically, they would hit eachother then perfectly stop, because no other outcome makes sense.

However, doing the math for sum of work on 2 balls with 1 kg and 1 m/s each:

W1=0.5\*m\_1\*v\_1\^2=0.5\*1\*1\^2=0.5

W2=0.5\*m\_2\*v\_2\^2=0.5\*1\*1\^2=0.5

Wnet=0.5+0.5=1=1/2\*m\_net\*v\_net\^2=1/2\*2\*v\_net\^2

v\_net=0.707.

&amp;#x200B;

How is this possible? How can they have a velocity? Which direction would it be going? Logically, they would stop in place.

Is it therefore the case that this equation does not work in this situation? Is it because this equation ignores loss to heat and sound etc. and normally that loss is somewhat negligible? I'm a little confused.

1. Because of the formulas for momentum and energy, only the same number of balls can fly of at the other side.
2. The first ball hits the second ball, the second the third…(often explained with billard balls) If multiple balls are lifted at the start, it works the same, but two times directly after each other
3. At the point of collision, two Shockwaves start to travel in both directions, reflect of the respective end of the cradle, and the cradle sepperates at the point they meet again.

Text: I analyzed recent scientific articles on the effect of parental age on the probability of producing a healthy kid: https://empirical-wonderland.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-effect-of-parental-age-on.html

However, I am not a biologist or a doctor myself. If anybody is also interested in this topic or has more knowledge on the subject, please have a look at my summary and let me know if you find any errors or disagree with me. Any comments are appreciated.

In a nutshell, I found that the probability of a woman getting pregnant in one year of trying (sex every 3 days) drops from 86% (at 20 years old) to 53% (at 40 years old). The probability of miscarriage also increases from 10% to 25%, while the probability of a birth defect rises from 1% to 15%, with an acceleration in this trend after the age of 40.

For men, the effects of age were less pronounced. The probability of making a woman pregnant within a year decreases by approximately 10% after the age of 40, compared to the age of 30. However, older men also tend to have less sex than younger ones. After 40, men increase the probability of miscarriage by 1.23 times (how I understood, it increases from 10% to 12% for a partner in her 20s, but this could be wrong) compared to 25-29. Finally, advanced paternal age has a significant positive effect on the rate of birth defects. However, the rate is generally low. For example, orofacial clefts have a probability lower than 0.2%. For fathers over 45, this probability is up to 0.3%.

I presume it’s from previous supernova explosions, which accrued in the solar atmosphere, but do we also know why they are at a particular height. For example neutral Ca is at about 1000 km above the solar surface in the chromosphere. Is there a particular reason for that height or is it random? Long post but appreciate any information!

Text: In my experience, the radio/microwave range is generally described with frequency (e.g. WiFi is said to be 2.4 GHz). Infrared/Visible/Ultraviolet is generally described with wavelength (e.g. sunlight peaks around 500 nm). X-Rays/Gamma Rays are commonly described with photon energy (e.g. the Compton telescope observes a range from 20 keV to 30 GeV).

How/when did these general conventions arise, and why don’t we describe the whole spectrum using the same terminology?

Do we know if there are any infectious diseases that take advantage of this too?  It seems like viruses in particular would benefit from this, either coding for the checkpoint molecules directly or tricking the host cell into overexpressing them to tamp down immune responses.

Text: If a photon can't pass through something, then that thing is creating a shadow of some form because a shadow is a lack of photons due to an obstruction. I've heard that some forms of energy, like plasma, don't block photons though. Can photons (not originating from the sun) pass through the center of the sun and make it to the other side?

Ex. If you had a laser, could you shine it at the sun and then see that laser on the other side of the sun? (Let's assume the observer on the other side of the sun can differentiate between light from the sun and light from the laser.)

Text: I've been watching the BPS Space youtube videos on making a solid rocket motor, and the intuitive reasons for having a converging and diverging section don't really make sense. It seems like if there's a conservation of energy, then sending all the mass out the back of the engine would yield the same thrust, as long as the exhaust can all be directed backwards.

So the diverging section makes sense, it allows the exhaust to expand and bounce off the walls of the nozzle, ending it directly backwards. And in an ideal situation the pressure at the exit of the nozzle is exactly ambient and all the exhaust is going directly backwards.

But wouldn't that happen anyways without the converging part?

I keep seeing people say that the converging part gets the velocity up to mach 1, and that chokes the nozzle. Does that mean that because the nozzle is choked the pressure inside the combustion chamber can get higher since the exhaust can't get out of the nozzle any faster, no matter how high the pressure is? And then because there's a higher pressure, more energy can be extracted from the pressure differential? If that's the case I don't understand how the higher pressure affects the downstream exhaust? How does it make the exhaust move faster in the diverging part?

Text: The textbook answer I seem to find everywhere is that they are a way to **represent** field strength and direction, they flow from north to south and the strength of the magnetic field is represented by the density of the lines in a given area. Sure, that makes sense.

However, my question arises when I physically see lines of flux when I scatter iron filings around a magnet. Surely these are not just a representation but a physical reality. In other words, if they were \*just\* a representation, we wouldn't observe them in the exact same way in physical reality, just as you would never be able to &quot;see&quot; the sine wave representing pressure changes moving through the air when describing sound, because that is not what is physically happening.

I'm curious why everything I can find says that they are merely a representation, and yet we can physically see lines forming from iron filings. What's going on there?

Edit: thank you for the excellent answers everyone! All these answers have collectively helped a lot.

Text: Filariasis or Elephantiasis is a human disease caused by the nematode parasite Wuchereria bancrofti. The adult parasite gives birth to a microfilaria from the lymphatic system. The worm then goes into the human's circulatory system, gets sucked by a mosquito, develops until it is reintroduced to another human host and develop into adults in the lymphatic system. Thus its cycle. I have heard that the mosquito is a necessary step in the cycle, but I don't see why other than it being the transmission vector. Is there another reason the parasite has to go through the mosquito in order for it to develop? Do mosquitoes contribute to the nematode's development? What are the differences between the filaria larvae before it has been ingested by the mosquito and after it has been injected into the human host?

Text: Hallo everyone 

so pretty much what the title says.  So let's say that you get infected with a germ and your innate immunity takes care of it but not easily, thus meaning a day or two with very mild symptoms. Does your adaptive immunity still kicks in so the germ gets wiped out instantly in the second infection or does it do nothing and only kicks in when you get fully sick? The second case would mean that your innate immunity would have to fight and defeat the same germ over and over again causing you to have those very mild symptoms repeatedly over very long periods. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what happens in reality?

Text: I'm studying platihelminths at the moment and the dorsal and ventral sides of the animal are repeatedly and specifically mentioned throughout the lesson. Like, higher platihelminths have 2 ventral nerve cords. 

I wanted to know how we determine which side of the animal is the dorsal/ventral side. It seems pretty obvious when it comes to planaria or sharks ( the side that faces the ground when they're in their 'usual positions' is ventral) but how do we determine which side is the dorsal/ventral side in animals like humans? Is it an arbitrary concept like the equatorial line that we have come up with for convenience? 

I know the anterior side of an animal is determined by cephalization and the concentration of sensory structures/ganglia/brain. Is there a specific parameter like that for the dorsal/ ventral sides?

Text: 
I don't know much about stats so excuse the question. But every day I come across studies that make claims, like coffee is good for you, abused children develop mental illness in adulthood, socializing prevents Alzheimer's disease, etc.
  

  
But rarely are any of these findings from true experiments. That is to say, the researchers either did not do a random selection, or did not randomly assign people to either do the behavior in question or not, and keeping everything else constant.
  

  
This can happen for practical reasons, ethical reasons, whatever. But this means the findings are correlational. I think much of epidemiological research and natural experiments are in this group.
  

  
My question is that with some of these studies, which cost millions of dollars and follow some group of people for years, can we draw any conclusions stronger than X is associated/correlated with Y? How? How confident can we be that there is a causal relationship?
  

  
Obviously this is important to do, otherwise we would still tell people we don't know if smoking &quot;causes&quot; a lot of diseases associated with smoking. Because we never conducted true experiments.

Also, is there any way to predict the next one? I ask this cause like, we can predict when suns will end, blockholes fade away, and stuff like that, and it seems kinda weird that we can't predict that(? (altho ik that it might not be that simple if we don't have a prediction))

Text: I was reading on GR receptor, if the receptor becomes downregulated and the negative feedback loop becomes less efficient, more cortisol would be secreted and the person would have high levels of cortisol but less binding to GR receptor.

In this case, would the person experience more stress or less stress? Does cortisol need to bind to GR receptor to mediate its stress response?

I fear that memorizing so much stuff might affect my memory in a bad way.

Text: This arose when my daughter noticed a natural gas smell in the hallway outside her room. I didn’t smell it, but then she said she only noticed it when she leaves her room. More smelling and going in and out of rooms and outside confirms - it smells like the additive to gas, but only when leaving her room after staying for more than a few seconds. It’s probably ultimately the litter box in the hall (which is kept clean and mostly doesn’t stink) but again the hall only smells like gas when leaving her room. It made us think of how our eyes seem to white-balance, and so we see an opposite color when strongly exposed. For instance if you spend a lot of time in a greensceen stage, the entire world looks magenta for a few minutes.

Text: I don't mean small/large scales as in molecules and galaxies.

I mean, if I were to expand to six times my size, but retain all the power of my limbs - like, my body strength *and my mass* is the same - would it feel exactly like gravity on the moon?

'Cause, I'm thinking, if I were 6 times my size, I could redefine &quot;one meter&quot; with respect to my own perspective (like, a meter is 0.56 of my height), and then I'd notice that things fall not at 9.8 m/s^2, but at 1.63 m/s^2. So it would for all intents and purposes appear to be like lunar gravity. Right?

Example: I drop an object from shoulder height. It takes about 1/2 second to hit the ground. If I'm six times taller, it'll take like 1.3 seconds, which is what it would take if I were normal height and standing on the moon.

(And people who make godzilla or ant man movies recognize this, and that's why everything is made to move like it's in slow motion? But that means that when ant man shrinks, it's like gravity is increasing - so he should be crushed when he shrinks.)

This feels like a dumb question, sorry. But I keep thinking about it.

Text: Hello!

First year bio student, just curious about how there seem to be so many zoonotic diseases originating in birds that can spread to humans. There's also a lot originating from other mammals like bats and rats, but that makes sense since humans are relatively closely related to them, and have really similar body systems and tissues. But birds confuse me as a common source of zoonotic diseases. I understand that they're really effective vectors and spreaders of disease, since they can cover so much distance easily and poop often all over the place, but on a biological system level I don't really understand. Birds and humans haven't shared an ancestor since over 200 million years ago, and have significantly different digestive and respiratory systems.   


Rambling aside, what i'm asking is why are we so compatible with birds in terms of diseases? How do so many diseases infect both birds and humans equally as easily when we're so different? Why do some diseases affect birds and humans, but not other mammals? What do birds and humans have in common that other mammals don't?

Also this part of the nucleotide chart gets &quot;flooded&quot; with alpha decay, everything in this region wants to alpha decay unlike the rest of the chart. Why is all this?

I'm assuming it has something to do with &quot;magic numbers&quot; but that answer is pretty unsatisfying, there has to be a better reason or some elaboration on that, it also seems relatively close to very stable lead so thats surprising.

To clarify: A dead leaf skitters across the ground when the wind blows, but that is not behavior, just a reaction of a physical body to the force of the wind. Are the white blood cell and the bacterium doing more than that? Is there some internal operation that adds something to their response to their chemical and physical environment? 

To clarify further: Humans percieve their environment and then react in complex ways to it that are determined by a central nervous system. The single-celled organisms don't have such a system (right?), but do they have something more than a dead leaf has, which helps to determine their response to their environment?

What, if anything, drives the &quot;behavior&quot; of these organisms? What do we call it? And how does it work?

Text: Both formylmethionine and methionine are coded by the same codon, AUG, so why isn't methionine mistakenly added in the beginning of protein synthesis, or why is formylmethionine not mistakenly added later on?

Also why do prokaryotes use formylmethionine instead of methionine, and why is methionine used to start protein synthesis in eukaryotes in general?

Articles today often note that producers have either been able to eliminate this practice or are &quot;moving away&quot; from it but are vague about exactly how, and about what they've used in place of those ingredients. So ... what's in it? Does the process or growing meat really work without animal products other than the stem cells needed to establish the culture?

Text: As I understand it (with my PhD in astronomy, but not in cosmology specifically), cosmic expansion means that space-time itself is expanding. I get the whole &quot;inflating balloon&quot; analogy. OK.

I read things about how if the universe has &gt; critical density then it will collapse (again). Or even if it's subcritical, then it should at least be slowing down in its expansion (were it not for dark energy driving faster expansion, that is).

The explanation I typically see for an expected slowing of the expansion is that gravity is an attractive force — it should pull stuff back together. Most explanations I read tend to end there.

But **why** would you expect gravity to arrest the expansion of the universe in the first place? The expansion is **not** a conventional explosion away from a center. It's **not the case** that other galaxies are flying away with some kinetic energy that is being transformed in to gravitational potential energy. Rather, expansion is an isotropic inflation, where everything gets further away from everything else as space-time expands.

If a particular galaxy were to get pulled by gravity in a way that would cause the universe to &quot;slow down&quot; its expansion, then would direction would that be? There is no center of the universe. The gravitational forces acting on any galaxy should be (on average) isotropic (but for some clusters and large-scale structure, but I don't think that's relevant to this question).

**TL;DR** — The statement &quot;gravity \[should\] slow the universe's expansion&quot; appears fallacious to me, and yet I see it everywhere\*. **What I am misunderstanding?**

\* by everywhere I mean, e.g., [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2021/01/05/how-is-the-universe-accelerating-if-the-expansion-rate-is-dropping/?sh=385dbe044093), [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/expanding-universe-slows-then-speeds/), [Harvard](https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/supernova/newdata/fate.html), many others.

I know piranhas are not mindless buzzsaw fish that kill everything in their path. But the cliche feeding frenzy school is something they actually do from time to time. This behaviour means they can tackle large live prey and large pieces of carrion.  
So, is there a kind of ocean fish that is similar to piranhas in this respect? A small, schooling fish that has sharp teeth and engages in feeding frenzy behaviour in large numbers.  
Note: This question specifically excludes sharks as they are large and, even though they sometimes form groups, are not a schooling fish. This question is specifically about little guys in large numbers that tackle large prey en masse.

Text: If my question is confusing, it’s like this:

Every substance has spectral emission and absorption lines. We can use those to identify substances in and around objects in space, for example. However, these absorption and emission lines don’t correspond to the color of a substance if I were to look at it in a macroscopic amount. 

Like the spectral lines for indium make it appear indigo (hence the name) but in reality it is a silvery-white metal. Iodine (afaik) also has pretty weak violet lines in its spectra, but it appears that color in vapor form. This is odd to me because what a substance absorbs and reflects directly contributes to its color, and spectral lines (which describe that concept) seemingly don’t match up.

I’m sure I’m misunderstanding or misrepresenting something, so if someone could explain this to me I would appreciate it greatly.

Text: (Just a heads up, I'm painfully aware of how obnoxiously long this is, Sorry about that!)

What exactly does stability of the group reagent (dil HCl, conc H2SO4, BaCl2, etc..) mean in this context?

To quote my textbook exactly (this is highschool-level chem by the way, but feel free to add more details as long as the explanation itself has that in mind): &quot;Hydrochloric acid is **more stable** than the acids from which the group anions are derived, so when it reacts with these anions salts, it replaces the less stable acids which are easy to volatilize or decompose in the form of gases which can be detected by suitable reagents &quot;

Is it an inherent property of any reagent in isolation, which is then compared to the required anions' acids (at least for groups whose reagent is an acid) to determine the suitable reagent for each group (As in Kc of the reagent and the produced acid are orders of magnitudes apart that the reagent's anions are undetectable?, but that wouldn't really make sense considering HCl and H2SO4 are strong acids dissociation-wise), So if all we cared about was that the reagents don't dissociate much relative to the products (ppt./volatile gas), considering strong acids would be borderline stupid.

Is it a property that is fundementally dependent on the ions in question, as in that it's defined as being &quot;with respect to&quot; said anion rather than &quot;more stable _than_&quot; it in some universal sense?
(At least for when the group reagent is a specific salt (BaCl2, for example), is it that the salt's cation really &quot;wants&quot; to bond with its group anions, beacuse that chemical releases a significant amount energy when formed which is what stability normally means, but then again, what about strong acids?)

Is it more nuanced than this? Is it a blend of these views? 

Also is it different depending on whether the reagent is an acid, a salt, an acidified other type of chemical, or something else? I mean, they are different chemicals and it would make sense that they get different treatments when deciding what reagent works for what, but then again, I have no idea what stability means *in this context* so I'm probably being unnecessarily verbose because I'm missing something pretty simple.

Bonus Question: Why do we use **Dilute** HCl in one group, but **Concentrated** H2SO4 in another? Is it because conc H2SO4 prevents haloacids from dissolving, rather than evolving to be detected, when detecting halogen ions?

Text: To start, I'm a biologist and am absolutely NOT questioning evolutionary theory. What's been bothering me though is when people ask the question &quot;Why did Trait X evolve&quot;? What they're asking of course is &quot;Why was Trait X advantageous?&quot;. Usually someone comes up with some logical reason why Trait X was advantageous allowing everyone to sit around and ponder whether or not the explanation is reasonable. If something doesn't come to mind that makes more sense, the explanation is usually agreed upon and everyone moves on. Ok cool, but we know of course that not all traits are propagated by natural selection. Some are propagated by genetic drift. Some traits may not confer a particular reproductive/survival advantage, they could be neutral, or just not mal-adaptive enough to be selected out of the population. 

So, outside of inductive logic, can we ever have empirical evidence for what factor(s) caused Trait X to be selected? I can sit here and tell you that a particular bird evolved feather patterns to blend in with its surroundings, thus giving it the adaptive advantage of avoiding predators, but this may not be true at all - it could be sexual selection or genetic drift that caused the trait to persist. While some adaptations selective pressures may be so obvious that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent, many are not so obvious and we should be cautious assigning causation when only correlation may exist.

Also that east Asian people are more likely to be lactose intolerant because of the relative lack of milk and cheese in their traditional diets.

Has anyone ever collected data on tobacco related illnesses in indigenous Americans? Sure, there are a ton of modern toxic substances in cigarettes now, but I wonder if they have a higher resistance to things like lung cancer caused by smoking?

Text: **Please read this entire post carefully and format your application appropriately.**

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/w3rut0/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxvii/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).
* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)
* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)
* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?
* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

\-------------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

`Username: /u/foretopsail`

`General field: Anthropology`

`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`

`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`

`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`

`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

You can submit your application by replying to this post.

Text:  The way I understand the causes for the Flynn effect are as follows:

1. Malnutrition and illness can stunt the IQ of a growing child. These have been on the decline in most of the world for the last century.
2. Education raises IQ. Public education is more ubiquitous than ever, hence the higher IQs today.
3. Reduction in use of harmful substances such as lead pipes.

Has this effect petered out in the developed world, or is it still going strong? Is it really an increase in everyone's IQ's or are there just less malnourished, illiterate people in the world (in other words are the rich today smarter than the rich of yesterday)?

I was wondering if anyone is aware of any papers out there that investigate political beliefs while controlling for both education and occupation.

For context, I had a discussion with someone who was explaining that having a college degree is associated with being more liberal. I was wondering if that relationship still held up when controlling for occupation: is it the careers that college educated people end up in that make them more liberal?

E.g. a couple small business owners I know are more conservative and don’t have college degrees, is it being a small business owner that makes them more conservative? Or not having spent the 4 years in college?

I looked around for some research on this but didn’t have much luck finding exactly what I was looking for. Thanks in advance.

Text: I’m interested in the winners effect which is where an increase in testosterone is observed following a victory in physical and non-physical competitions. I’ve seen studies that replicate the effects in sports, chess, and video games.

The studies I have read use face to face competitions in their experiments, I’m wondering if there’s any evidence of the winners effect in non face to face competitions. For example, will winning an online chess game or video against someone who I don’t know at all increase my testosterone? My hypothesis is that it won’t as my mind doesn’t really know if I’m actually playing against another person, which means my mind doesn’t think that my position on the social dominance hierarchy is changing.

If a bakery buys a cellphone to handle incoming calls, is the cellphone a final good? I imagine the bakery is the final user of the cellphone. Yet the cellphone seems to be part of the bakery's inputs, so I'm hesitant to say yes.

The essence of my question is basically that there most be some driving force behind the expansion of the universe, and as the universe gets larger, my assumption would be that this driving “force” would need more energy in order to expand it at the same (or even accelerated) rate. Doesn’t this seemingly break the law of COE, since it appears to have an ever increasing amount of energy with which it expands?

Text: Question provoked by New York Times article I read today showing that this form of hydropower is becoming more popular, but that's behind paywall so I wont share here. Here are two descriptions that are not behind paywall:

[https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/pumped-storage-hydropower](https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/pumped-storage-hydropower)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage\_hydroelectricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity)

I'm not in this field so take my description with a grain of salt, but my understanding is that for this type of power generation, water is used to generate electricity by gravity, similar to standard hydroelectric power (e.g. a dam), but in 'off hours', excess electricity is used to pump water up from a lower reservoir to an upper one. When more electricity is needed, that upper reservoir is used (gravity flow down to lower reservoir) to generate electricity. 

I must be missing something--to my mind, based on classical physics, this seems like it must be inefficient--how can we pump water uphill with electricity, then use that water flowing back downhill to generate more electricity than it took to pump it uphill? I must be missing something--perhaps there's always a secondary source of power churning in the background that is always available for electricity generation, so it's just excess electricity from this that is used to pump water uphill? 

Thanks in advance for enlightening me.

Text:  

So I am very familiar with the concept of mirror neurons and all of the debate surrounding them. I need some help understanding what they actually mean? I have done some research and asked professors and can't get a clear answer.

I know the idea is that mirror neurons are supposedly neurons that fire when you observe AND do an action (neurons that are activated when you reach for something are also activated when you see someone else reach). 

I really do not think that mirror neurons “cause” imitation, but I am confused on something. If someone is watching a video of an actor reaching for targets and has to tap a key corresponding to where the actor reaches, what would the expected results be? My question is, if an actor reaches to a target on THEIR right (OBSERVER’S left) and the observer has a shorter reaction time to respond to the same target (by hitting a left key) than opposite (hitting the right key), could mirror neurons be a possible explanation? Or not, because mirror neurons would imply that observer’s would be faster to hit the THEIR right (exactly imitating the action of the person on screen?). 

I guess my question is just if the “imitation” in mirror neurons refer to things from the observer’s point of view, or the actor’s. In simpler terms, would mirror neuron theories mean that an observer would be more inclined to match the direction of someone (mirroring them…Actor-Left-Arm Movement would lead to Observer-Right-Arm-Movement) or the action of someone (Actor-Left-Arm-Movement would lead to Observer-Left-Arm-Movement). So sorry for the complicated and confusing and unclear post! TIA!

Text: How did wings evolve?

I understand how natural selection would select for extensions of already occurring qualities; even SLIGHTLY longer necks in giraffes would be IMMEDIATELY more advantageous and increase the likelihood of producing offspring. 

Surely a wing wouldn’t evolve all at once, but at the same time a gradual wing development would seem disadvantageous in the span of a single generation or even multiple and wouldn’t be selected for. A small bump or even the beginning of a wing that doesn’t function properly wouldn’t be selected for right?

It seems like the kinda appendage that would need to be mostly there and mostly functional but wouldn’t be spontaneously selected for over the course of many generations.

I was reading up on iron's role in star death which got me curious about the energy release of fusion &amp; fission reactions throughout the periodic table. It seems intuitive to me that a nuclear energy output equation would look something like this:  
\*energy output = (Mass of extra products converted to MeV) - (nuclear binding energy)\*  
So for example, if a reaction produces an extra 2 neutrons, would your energy output be the mass of the 2 neutrons minus the binding energy required to get them to split?

So my question is, why does a hot meal taste better than the exact same cold one?  I mean a cold tin of beans tastes terrible compared to a warmed tin of beans yet they physically have had nothing added or removed other than heat.

Is this something we perceive as being better because we are biologically programmed to feel more fulfilled after a hot meal, or is there a chemical change in the food which impacts flavour? 

Also why is this sometime the case in reverse, I.e cold pizza sometimes tastes better than hot pizza?

The orbit seems to be much more elliptical than Earths orbit, which is quite circular and doesnt play any role in weather or tempereture, because the distance from the sun doesnt vary that much.

But mercurys distance varies much more.

I mean, surely it could have an affect right?

If you can find a graph related to this, it would be awesome, but any calculations or things like that are fine too. I just don't know where to start, and google doesnt help either.

Text: Iron-54 is a naturally occurring stable isotope of iron, consisting of 5.845% of natural iron found on earth, according to the isotope table found here https://applets.kcvs.ca/IPTEI/IPTEI.html

If one were to separate a mostly pure amount of Fe-54, how would its physical properties differ from the more common Iron-56, which composes 91.754% of natural iron? There is certainly some Iron-54 among normal pieces of iron, but only about 5.8%. For example, if you were to make a sword out of nearly 100% Iron-54, how would it differ from one made out of normal iron? Would it heat treat and temper differently? Would it be ever so slightly more lightweight than normal iron, due to it not having as many neutrons in its nucleus? Would it be more or less resistant to rusting?

Text: &gt;Wheeler,(1958). Scientific Glassblowing, Interscience Publishers, New York &amp; London. Chapter IV Basic Operations, Page 56. &quot;Milligan has found that the strength of glass containing cracks is greatly influenced by a liquid in contact with the surface of the glass. Exposure of the surface to air saturated with alcohol or water greatly reduces the strength. Putting a drop of water on the crack reduces the strength by about 20% whereas moistening the crack with dry paraffin oil strengthens the tube by about 20%. Milligan does not advance an explanation for either of these effects, but many glassblowers can attest to the accuracy of the statement that water in the scratch reduces the strength of the glass tubing&quot;.

To cut glass, a cutting tool is used to make a scored line, then the glass is tapped or torqued and the stress concentration at the scratch causes the glass to break along the desired line.

Glassblowers always suggest wetting the scored mark to make the break easier, cleaner, and more reliable. Why does this work?

Text: The Wikipedia article on [Causes of Cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_cancer) sums up the common wisdom thus: 

&gt; **Cancer is caused** by [genetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation) changes leading to uncontrolled cell growth and [tumor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm) formation. The basic cause of sporadic (non-familial) cancers is DNA damage and [genomic instability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomic_instability). 

I recently was doing some reading on non-mutagenic carcinogens, and came upon an article, [*Mechanisms of non-genotoxic carcinogens and importance of a weight of evidence approach*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1383574209000428), which states very clearly, emphasis mine: 

&gt;Non-genotoxic carcinogens are **substances that induce cancer** through  indirect stimulation of hyperplastic responses, **without altering DNA,  chromosome number or structure**. Non-genotoxic carcinogens have a wide  variety of mechanisms of cancer induction including receptor-mediated  endocrine modulation, non-receptor mediated endocrine modulation, tumor  promoting, inducers of tissue-specific toxicity and inflammatory  responses, immunosuppressants, or gap junction intercellular  communication 

There are many similar sources, but this one seems to state the point most explicitly. So, what's going on here? Has &quot;cancer&quot; simply been differently defined back in 2009 than it is now? Has the evidence been overturned that there is such a thing as a carcinogen without genotoxicity? Are they simply so rare as to be of no practical relevance and so knowledge never made it into public consciousness? Some other explanation?

Text: I was just watching [this Vox video](https://youtu.be/LAkFtka3UFw) about why more people need glasses today (that turned out to be more on how to prevent and treat myopia than analysing the causes) and made me wonder. The video goes back to 1971 and I find hard to believe that as many people then would have access to optometry and glasses and the threshold to go to the doctor would generally be higher.

Similarly, particularly in the case of my country, I often hear about the general rise of diabetes, and at the same time, I remember being a kid and even until like 15 ~ 20 years ago doctors complaining, very publicly that diabetes was not a disease that was given the worries necessary and the diagnostic was very lacking to the point of many people discovering the disease only when they had terrible consequences. Today I practically never see a diabetic foot amputee or a fully blind diabetic. So my thought is: &quot;even if diabetes rates have increased in the country how do they know if statistics were so much unexistent?&quot;

This all leads me to my broader question, in the title, that is, do these growth analysis generally take in consideration increase in knowledge about the population. I take the opportunity to go further and ask, if so, how exactly is it done and how accurate are they?

Text: Hello everyone

I've been studying neuro-pathology and have been having difficulty in understanding how the pathophysiology of PD results in its clinical manifestation. This probably has an obvious answer but I haven't been able to figure it out.

What I've understood till now is that there's destruction of the dopamine-producing neurons in the Pars Compacta layer of the Substantia Nigra. Dopamine generally counters the normal inhibitory influence on motor activity in the Basal Ganglia so a decrease in dopamine would naturally make it harder to initiate muscle movement.

This would explain the bradykinesia, gait disturbances and dysarthria **but how would this result in rigidity and the resting pin-rolling tremor.** Why would this be seen when motor activity is already reduced?

I'm a med student and haven't studied neuroscience in detail so I'm sure there's something I'm missing. I've consulted my textbooks and google but still haven't found an answer.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated!

Text: let's say i have an open circuit with a 5V voltage source, with the positive terminal connected to node A and the negative terminal connected to node B (which are not connected to anything, hence an open circuit).

If take B as a reference point, A should have a potential of 5V.

let's say I have a 2 ohm resistor connected between the positive terminal and A.

The circuit is open, there is no voltage drop across this resistor, hence A still has a potential of 5V.

if I connect a current source across that resistor, say 5A, then ohm's law tells us that the resistor has a voltage drop of 10V.

What i want to know is that does A now have a potential of 5V-10V = -5V? does the voltage drop across the resistor caused by the current cause the potential of the battery's positive terminal to drop across the resistor?

I chose an open circuit as an example, to make the calculation easy, but if the circuit were closed, would this voltage drop in resistor caused by the current source ADD to the voltage drop in the resistor caused by the current flowing in the main, voltage source loop?

Text: We were taught in elementary school that the reason gas is amorphous is because the molecules are really spread apart. The reason solids are hard and can’t be moved through is because the molecules are packed together. 

We’ve all heard that 99% of an atom is just empty space, and atoms make up molecules. 

So with all that empty space, what’s stopping the molecules from getting closer together?

Additionally, as something gets colder, it’s volume shrinks. Hot air will rise above cold air. We were also told that was because the molecules are moving faster. So theoretically, a molecule can reach absolute cold and be able to be packed right up next to another molecule, without that 99% of space, right?

Text: In other words, how much do sports-specific skills transfer to different but related tasks in the real world?

I have a number of follow up questions too:

- Does it matter _which_ sports you play, or would most vigorous and contact sports more or less accomplish the job?

- Also, how much do specific skills matter? Is throwing skill, as one example, a crucial skill to learn at a young age? Would throwing not only train the muscle groups that throw things but also develop a deep intuition for projectiles and judging distances, which would be hard to learn from other experiences?

- What is it like for an adult to attempt to learn sports skills for the first time?

These are tricky questions for me to research. It's one thing to learn the biomechanics of the body or a specific technique, but it's another to learn longitudinally how much my learning that is in any way beneficial to me for something other than the sport itself. I guess I've always assumed that there were tons of direct correlation benefits, but I don't actually have an answer to that, and I don't know what studies have been done on this.

Text: trying to understand space walks better..
  
If a = v-v0/t (acceleration formula) and you throw a tennis ball in space, the starting velocity is the same as the end velocity due to no air resistance (object in motion stays in motion). Because then numerator will always = 0 so no acceleration.  

And if not, then the ball would surely fall back to earth. And if that’s true, wouldn’t humans also float towards earth away from the ISS on a spacewalk?  

And gravity is still present even at the ISS. Satellites use fuel to stay in orbit (yet the moon seemingly orbits earth in a way where gravity is not pulling it closer essentially in a perfect way which IMO proves godlike or spiritual influence on literal matter for it to be there over 1000s of years), so how is a human on a spacewalk not being dragged by their tether and instead it looks as if they move with it. Or is the force of the spaceship canceling out gravity what keeps the human moving at a constant rate seemingly locked in place?  
  
Blows my mind that the ISS is going 17k+ mph and the humans with it.

Text: Dielectric breakdown is an issue but there are materials (diamond, Teflon, ultra-high vacuum) that only break down at absurdly high voltages.

If you want the most bang for your buck (both volume and mass wise) why not step up the voltage a capacitor charges at super duper high? Then the energy of the capacitor is proportional to the volume * permittivity * dielectric strength ^2. Why not have a centimeter of diamond between two plates with a potential difference of a million or so volts? That’s good energy density right there. According to my calculations, diamond capacitors should have somewhere around a hundredth the volumetric energy density of gasoline, which really isn’t *that* bad for certain applications

One thing I noticed is that when I sing, the stutter goes away completely. So that got me thinking. Can you train your brain to use the part that it's using for singing for example, to use it for speaking, thus making the stutter go away completely. I'm sorry if this is a stupid question, and I know I might ask for the impossible. But still, I consider it an interesting thought.

It makes sense that not having an atmosphere will always be better than correcting for an atmosphere but ground based telescopes have so many other advantages (much larger diameters, no similar concerns about weight or power restrictions, far fewer thermal issues) that I'm curious what unique advantages Hubble still has. When HST finally shuts down does it make sense to plan a future orbital optical telescope or is it only &quot;worth it&quot; for telescopes that operate in wavelengths that are blocked by our atmosphere?

I worked as a fact-checker for Vox podcasts, including for the award-winning science podcast &quot;Unexplainable.&quot; I was also a researcher for National Geographic's &quot;Brain Games: On the Road&quot; TV show and served as a communications specialist at the International Arts + Mind Lab at Johns Hopkins University's Brain Science Institute.

Have questions about mental health, how [inflammation may cause depression](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/02/23/depression-brain-inflammation-treatment/), or why many of us are [forgetting much of our memories of the pandemic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/03/13/brain-memory-pandemic-covid-forgetting/)? Or have other questions about the neuroscience of everyday life or human behavior? I'll be on at **4 p.m. ET (20 UT)**, ask me anything!

Text: Seeing as people living in regions with less sun coverage and less frequent exposure tend to have lighter blue eyes, it seems this is the body’s attempt to let more light in. With less melanin acting as sunglasses in the iris, it allows for better photon reception, thus letting more light in. This, of course, also means that people with lighter colored eyes are more sensitive to bright light/the sun. 

Anyways, if someone has blue eyes, and they moved up to Scandinavia in a darker region, would the melanin in their iris eventually lower and bring out a brighter shade of blue? 

Thanks strangers, cheers to science! Keep being awesome!

Text: Hi reddit! We're members of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) Physics Frontiers Center, and for the last 15 years, we have been using radio telescopes supported by the National Science Foundation to turn a suite of millisecond pulsars into a galaxy-scale gravitational-wave detector. Millisecond pulsars are remnants of extinguished massive stars; as they spin hundreds of times each second, their &quot;lighthouse-like&quot; radio beams are seen as highly regular pulses. Gravitational waves stretch and squeeze space and time in a characteristic pattern, causing changes in the intervals between these pulses that are correlated across all the pulsars being observed. These correlated changes are the specific signal that we have been working to detect.

Our most recent dataset offers compelling evidence for gravitational waves with oscillations of years to decades. These waves are thought to arise from orbiting pairs of the most massive black holes throughout the Universe: billions of times more massive than the Sun, with sizes larger than the distance between the Earth and the Sun. Future studies of this signal will enable us to view the gravitational-wave universe through a new window, providing insight into titanic black holes merging in the hearts of distant galaxies and potentially other exotic sources of low-frequency gravitational waves. International collaborations using telescopes in Europe, India, Australia, and China have independently reported similar results.

Text: As we know, our planets orbit of the sun and the angle in which it rotates has an impact on our atmosphere which is why we have seasons. And every 365 days or so we pass through the four seasons.

So if we look at that in a wider scale and look at our solar system. We’ll see that our solar system is orbiting the centre of the galaxy and it takes approximately 230 million years for our solar system to complete 1 full orbit.

My question is that do we potentially pass through some parts of the galaxy that have a positive or negative effect on our climate during those 230 million years? I find it hard to believe that we can orbit our sun (which is comparison to the galaxy is a tiny ball of fire) and have huge impacts on weather and growth etc. Yet being in a different point in the galaxy would have zero impact.

Can someone help me understand?

Text: I'm taking a course in immunology and here it is mentioned that enzymes and peptides are part of the chemical &quot;barrier&quot; in the gut. Since enzymes are basically long peptides that create big complexes, I wonder what the purpose of making that distinction is. I read online that, in general, peptides function as signalling molecules. Is that the case here as well or do they have more functions?

Text: Apologies if this is the wrong tag, I was torn between biology and chemistry and medicine.

I understand that the mechanism behind washing with soap and water as an effective pathogen control mechanism is a combination of friction, water washing things away, surfactants lifting oils (and anything mixed in) off the surface down with the water, and the breaking of lipid layers that enclose many pathogens. 

I have eczema and am looking for options that are less likely to aggravate the condition, and these &quot;soap free&quot; cleansers keep coming up, as well as things with &quot;gentle surfactants&quot; like Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate. 

My question is, do the differences between these products reduce the effectiveness of handwashing? Say, after using the toilet or handling raw meat, would such a thing be an appropriate swap for normal   liquid hand soaps?

Text: Energy can not be created, nor destroyed,  only transformed. When a power plant generates electricity,  that energy gets used up instantly by some device on the other end. A power plant has to be able to predict energy usage and ramp up more generators to feed the need of their service area. They don't want to run out, so they would always be generating more power than the city uses in any given moment. That would leave a sizable excess of power in the system that wasn't used up by a device. The power plant is sending the next wave of power down the line, so that excess has to go somewhere. How does the power plant discharge the excess energy?

In the room you will still feel a force pointing outwards and can clearly determine if the room is rotating. Why is the rotation reference frame special in that way? By pure definition it's not accelerated, shouldn't it be an inertial frame?

There is mach's theorem that says you can only detect relative rotation, i.e. rotation relatively to the rest of the universe. That would at least take away the absolute reference.

Text: Just thought about it so my thoughts are a bit confused. 

I know time depends on gravity force as time-space is a field. When you are next to a heavy body time is faster. 
When we calculated the age of the universe we used thermodynamic equations that ruled how it will expands and reversed them to find a single point, but that only applies to calculations and observations made on earth right? 
So is our universe 13.7 billion years old only for a constant earth gravity? Would it be anither result somewhere else in the universe? Could it be shorter as in the beginning of expansion everything was very dense and thus happened faster?

If the light at the nearest part of the galaxy took 110,000 light years less time to reach us than the furthest part and the galaxy has moved through the universe in that time then wouldn’t its shape be distorted?

But if they are mounted in solid bone sockets, how can braces still move them? Does the bone ahead of the movement 'part' and the bone behind close in? Or does the old socket stay in place and just grow bigger in the direction of the tooth's movement? Is this connected at all to why many need retainers after having braces removed?

Text: I've recently learned to scuba dive, and naturally I've been looking up all the places I might be able to dive in the future, and asking experienced divers I know their thoughts about where the most interesting spots to dive with aquatic life are.

I've been surprised to find that freshwater lakes and rivers don't seem to have much in the way of macroscopic biological structures that create habitat, unlike oceans (which have corals, kelp forests, soft-bodied anemones, huge clam beds, seagrass meadows, etc). It also seems that freshwater animals stem from a severely restricted subset of overall aquatic life. Divers have been telling me that the only really interesting stuff to see in freshwater are wrecks. This is wild to me.

I spent a while trying to find out whether there were structurally complex biological underwater environments in the Great Lakes, thinking that massive lakes must surely support lots of interesting variety, but I'm not finding much variety in environments beyond scenes of greyish fish swimming around over relatively flat sediment or rocky bottoms.

I'm confused by this. I know that small ponds and bogs can be full of stuff like rushes and lily pads and duckweed and other things, so I'd expect to see that sort of environment grow larger and more varied with more space in lakes and rivers. With shallower waters (compared to the ocean) and a high ratio of edge-to-area where biomass from land can enter the water to provide nutrients or evolutionary access points, I'd have thought there would be an abundant variety of aquatic plant life, and that you'd see things like kelp forests or lily pad groves or lake-grass meadows; and I know freshwater hydras exist, so I'm surprised there aren't freshwater sessile cnidarians forming beds along lake bottoms. 

I've heard the mineral content of freshwater is too low for animals that form hard structures like corals, but there are plenty of soft-bodied structures in the ocean too that don't seem to have developed in freshwater. There are a few microbialites in places like Pavilion Lake, BC, but those seem to exist in lakes that are otherwise relatively low in biological activity.

What are some of the factors that prevent these things from evolving in freshwater? Or do they exist plentifully elsewhere, maybe just not at temperate latitudes?

She looked at the picture in which it looked pretty big and called the Weight stat. To her disbelief the card was beaten by my Beluga whale. They looked pretty similar, however her shark's weight of 87kg was dwarfed by the Beluga's 1,400kg. To explain why something of comparable size might have a weight of more than 15 times its rival i assumed it was something to do with bone density. However, my daughter then grabbed the Basking Shark card, which while twice as long as the Sand tiger shark had a weight of 5,200kg, or almost 60 times the weight. But they're both sharks she said, how come the Sand tiger is so light. I was stumped.

Could someone explain why there is such a varying weight (density) between shark species so i can tell my daughter? If possible both from an anatomical perspective and a practical/evolutionary one (so why)?

Basically, I'm wondering how geologists determine that a volcano is separate from another, but especially in this case.

Since the explosion expands equally in all directions, it provides force equally in all directions. The &quot;back&quot; of the engine passes through the opening at the back of the nacelle, providing no  force.

The &quot;front&quot; of the engine pushes against the inside of the nacelle, pushing it forward. 

However, recently I have read that its actually the gas *exciting* the nacelle which provides the thrust. How does that work?

Edit: Everyone keeps describing the rest of the turbojet, and I appreciate it but I have a (decent) understanding of the rest of the system. It's specifically how air escaping out the back moves the jet forward without pushing on it that's throwing me

Text: What I mean is I have a hypothesis.

Euarchontoglires were apparently originally obligate omnivores: that explain why some of them are great scavengers, and why they can tolerate MUCH MORE ethanol, caffeine and theobromine than almost all other animals. To be exact, all apes (such as gibbons and humans), rabbits, squirrels, murids (such as brownn rats and house mice), cricetids (such as hamsters), and caviids (such as Guinea pigs and capybaras) can all drink coffee, and eat chocolate, for many other animals, they are very toxic (just ask birds, squamates, felines, canids, and even equids). Euarchontoglires that are omnivores with carnivorous tendancies include mandrills, baboons, aye-ayes, and water rats. Euarchontoglires that are omnivores with herbivorous tendencies include gorillas, lemurs, and squirrels. Euarchontoglires that really are obligate omnivores include anatomically modern humans, chimpanzees (both common chimpanzees and bonobos formerly known as pygmy chimpanzees), pen-tailed treeshrews, hamsters, brown rats, and house mice. The only Euarchontoglires that are obligate carnivores I know are tarsiers, and the only Euarchontoglires I know that are obligate herbivores I know are caviids, beavers, and mole-rats.

Also, most Euarchontoglires are small: the world's largest extant Euarchontoglires species is either the anatomically modern human (*Homo sapiens*) (if we are talking about both height, and legspan), or the eastern gorilla (*Gorilla beringei*) (if we are talking about mass, volume, and armspan), or the tetraploid rodent (I forgot its scientific name, sorry) (if we are talking about genome size). If we include extinct species, there was a South American rodent that weighed 1,000 kilograms, or even more, and maybe *Gigantopithecus blacki* was 2.4-3.6 metres tall with a mass of 350-1,000 kilograms.

Finally, Euarchontoglires tend to be gregarious (such as rabbits, beavers, and gibbons), or alternatively prosocial (such as capybaras, brown rats, house mice, lemurs, gorillas, and chimpanzees), or even eusocial (such as mole-rats, and, in a sense, humans). Among the exceptions, there are orangutans (which are solitary in an on and off manner), and hamsters (which are obligate solitary). However, some Euarchontoglires are pacifists (such as bonobos, gorillas, orangutans, capybaras, and Guinea pigs), other are warriors (such as brown rats, house mice, baboons, mandrills, common chimpanzees, and humans) (I sometimes say that, in comparison to humans, orangutans are autistic empaths, and hamsters are schizophrenic sociopaths).

Do you agree with me? Why or why not? Thanks.

Text: Hi, 
I'm an undergraduate bio taking organic chemistry and we recently covered Markovnikovs, after the lesson I went on to read a bit about Mr Markovnikov and learned he was alive long before the invention of many of the important equipment used in modern chemical analysis.

I asked my professor how a man alive during the mid 1800s to early 1900s was able to actually &quot;do&quot; this without the use of advanced technology we have today. She said she wasn't actually sure but that his Rule (until boron enters the equation of course) is a fundamental aspect of chemical reactions regardless.

Is it a situation similar to Gregor Mendel doing his pea study and accidentally stumbling onto a (in terms of Mendellian genetics) correct conclusion?

T Cells are a crucial part of immunity right? They can differentiate into memory cells.

In the book, it says that a T Cell's lifespan is 20-30 years so basically a 20-30 year old man can still have the same T Cells and antibodies from the immune response of the mandatory vaccine they took when they were babies. And it also explains why we sometimes need to re-vaccinate for some diseases like Tetanus and Rabies and recently COVID 19.

Both times I looked around and there was definitely nothing nearby causing this, and I was about 3km from the nearest road or house.

Would the water not eventually recede? How can water permanently flood a place unless it’s a basin? Seeing as doggerland is still like 20-30 meters underwater, surely it couldn’t have survived as a basin for that deep under the sea level so close to the coast.

Text: First time posting on this sub, don't go to hard on me if I do something wrong please!  


I was thinking about this while looking at a lightning strike that curved quite weirdly, and struck something that really didn't seem like the most optimal point. I had never really thought to look deeper into how it, and the whole &quot;path of least resistance&quot; thing worked and accepted that statement at face value. While thinking about how it would work, I tried to picture the below experiment in my head, but couldn't quite make sense of it. I don't have the means to actually do it myself, but I'm still burningly curious and google has not helped.  


Two long rods of different conductive materials are connected in the middle of their length by a strip of a third conductive material. One of the two rods is made of a material with &quot;medium&quot; conductivity, while the other is substantially more conductive. The strip in the middle is still conductive but is much poorer at it than either of the other two. Attached to the &quot;medium&quot; conductivity rod is a source of electricity. For instance a Car Battery.   


How would electricity flow in this situation? Would it follow the &quot;medium&quot; rod to it's end, ignoring the bridge over? Personally I am not sure if it would be able to realize that there is a potentially &quot;better&quot; path for it on the other side of this obstacle, obviously since there is no intelligence to it. But would it do so if the other side is &quot;worth it&quot; anyways? Or would it spread throughout the entire device like a liquid through a series of tubes, only being slowed down not stopped entirely by the resistive bridge?  


If it does flow only or primarily down the &quot;worse&quot; path because a seemingly terrible obstacle is all it can &quot;see&quot;, the situation would remind me of the False Peak concept, which I primarily know from exposure to Ai Learning, or in the context of trying to find the highest point in a given map.  


Thank you in advance for your answers, I hope I was not just spouting easily explained nonsense.

That's quite hot, and most people don't have the ability to cook above those temperatures, sure. What happens if you did cook mushrooms hot enough to break down the chitin, though?

I did some googling, didn't see anything, but feel free to link any articles that do answer the question.

Earth's magnetic pole between Canada and Russia is actually a *South* pole because the North Pole of a compass is attracted to it. We slipped up when naming these concepts before we fully understood them.

But what about other planets? Is the magnetic pole on Mars' northern hemisphere a magnetic south pole like Earth or a north pole? IIRC Earth's poles flip from time to time but what about the other planets?

Text: On the most recent episode of [Volts](https://open.substack.com/pub/davidroberts/p/taking-carbon-out-of-the-air-and), they discussed CO2 sequestration in concrete. The claim is that injecting CO2 into the cement/concrete mixing process increases its compressive strength. According to this literature review from [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21148-w), &quot;CO2 curing can decrease the compressive strength of CCU concrete when compared to conventional concrete.&quot; 

If CO2 injection strengthens concrete, then it might be a real candidate for long term carbon sequestration. The incentives align. If it doesn't, it will be difficult to get concrete manufacturers on board at scale.

it's a question I keep coming back to as I work on my thesis and I do not yet have a solid idea about this.
  

  
Say, on a behavioral level person A has a significantly smaller difference than person B in reaction times between the congruent and incongruent conditions in a Stroop-test (indicating better inhibitory control). How would you imagine they would differ in an EEG recording?
  

  
I tried my best in researching this myself, but all I could find sound evidence for is the [association between n2/n4 and inhibition as a cognitive process.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33217721/)
  

  
Looking forward to your answers!

Text: Hi everyone !

Basically, I am worldbuilding for a future Tabletop RPG, and I need some informations.

I want to know how much influence does a natural satellite have on the formation of planets, its continents, its landmasses, and all about geography and climate (maybe geology ?). Also, what would happen if a natural satellite suddenly appears around a planet that did not had one ?

This might be a lot of information for one simple answer, so feel free to point me towards article or other papers that can explain it for a non-scientist like me.

Also, maybe you can give me a precise answer based on the context of my world. To be simple, there was Pangea, magic stuff happened, big war against Creator of the Universe, he/she/it decides to punish enemies by throwing them and their city in space, creating a new Mars-like (like red desert planet) satellite directly from the crust of the original Earth-like planet they lived on. This whole process is such a cataclysm that it destroys Pangea and reshapes the lands.
I need some kind of clues to know how I can reshape this world and how this new satellite influence this.

Thanks !

But I never see any details on how the expansion rate is calculated from the other primary method, that of examining the Cosmic Microwave Background.

Text: Mutations in DNA occur when DNA isn't copied quite right or is exposed to external influences, such as radiation. These mutations are then tested in the real world in what we call &quot;survival of the fittest.&quot; A mutation is more likely to be passed on to future generations if said mutation proves to be more beneficial than not. 

All of this I understand, but I'm having difficulty wrapping my head around &quot;spontaneous&quot; mutations. To me, it almost seems like these mutations are &quot;intentional&quot; rather than spontaneous. Is there anything inherent about DNA that ensures mutations occur so that evolution can occur as well? Did DNA itself evolve (for lack of a better word) in a way so that it produced mutations because that was somehow beneficial to its own survival? Or is it all truly spontaneous?

I've been doing some of my own research on this, but I guess I'm just confused as to how exactly mutations occur, and would really appreciate any clarification. Thanks!

Text: Based on my extremely limited understanding, the blue-eyes mutation in human beings can be traced back to an  isolated origin in the Western Hunter-Gatherer (WHG) ancestry pool, around 10,000 years ago at the turn of the Mesolithic period.

With the arrival of the Yamnaya culture, the first Proto Indo-European speakers arrived in Europe due to a western migration. As a result of this migration and the melting ice age, a good chunk of the WHG tribes moved north into the Scandanavian glaciers, hence the prevelance of blue eyes amongst Scandinavian peoples.

My question is, how did the blue-eyes mutation then spread to places such as the Indian subcontinent? It would make sense if the blue-eyes trait was of Caucasian origin, as these people also moved east into India and the Middle East.

Am I missing something here?

I read Kahnemanns 'Thinking, fast and slow' maybe 10 years ago and just finished a book about Acceptance &amp; Commitment therapy and to me it seems like the ideas in each synergize very well. 

E.g. ACT talks about 'fusion' of cognitive processes with behavior - a system 1 acting automatically - and proposes 'observing' your cognitive processes and 'defusing' these with behavior - a more deliberate and conscious system 2. Has there been any research into this? It seems like it could help therapy if the ways to assist system 2 are employed?

I was chewing on a watermelon a second ago and thought, ok I've swallowed all the juice/water, what am I chewing?

Coreect me if I'm wrong but meats are made up of protein, the thing holding it together and plants are held up by cellulose (a type of fiber). Which makes me think watermelon and all fruits the same are held up by cellulose.

I can understand with snakes and spiders as they need to defend themselves and kill relatively large animals. But jellyfish face similar threats everywhere like turtles, whales, seabirds etc and they eat similar food like small fish and crustaceans while having massive differences in their ability to harm humans.

Text: Just watched the movie Life, and like in every space Sci-Fi movie there's an open hatch at one point and all the air gets sucked out, threatening to pull everyone out into space. I can see some violent air movement when the decompression happens, but it doesn't seem possible that that movement could sustain itself for long enough to be a problem.

Does anybody know what would really happen? I know there was one small hole in the ISS and nothing happened - a slight drop in the pressure that they let the crew sleep through and a small patch.

Text: I read a comment that said that the hormone testosterone is what makes the difference between males and females. So, males having a greater amount of testosterone than females during life and before being born makes their body different than females. And I guess that the user who made the comment (although they didn't explicitly tell it) thought that with the hormone estrogen the same logic applies.

I would like to know if there would be any differences between males and females if they had the same hormones and amount of them. I am aware that the chromosomes would still be different between males and females. But would there be any other physical differences? (strength, height, bones, prostate, face features, hips, breasts etc.) Also, would the genitals be different or the genitals need hormones (in this case hormones before birth) to become different between males and females? (As far as I know, the glans and the clitoris have a common origin, and the scrotus and the labia have a common origin too) 

Finally, I am sorry if it sounds strange or weird that I say *&quot;males&quot;* and *&quot;females&quot;* instead of *&quot;men&quot;* and *&quot;women&quot;*. I was honestly trying to not be offensive towards transgender people and didn't know what were the rigth words to use.

Text: A few months ago I saw a few articles (I linked one below) that said around 550 million years ago the magnetic field weakened and almost &quot;collapsed&quot;, but was strengthened later by the formation of the inner core. 

The problem is that all the articles I've found don't go into *why* that formation caused the magnetic field to strengthen, only that it did. 

What actually is it about the presence of the inner core that makes the magnetic field stronger than it would be without it? And how do we know?

The logical conclusion then is that linear acceleration is a gradient as well, but I can't really wrap my mind around how or why that would be.

I looked around and saw that many sites count their tooth as a horn, but I thought horns were pieces of bone connected primarily to the skull of the animal? I know teeth are like that but it feels like theres a difference since horns (as far as I know) aren't used for hunting as much and are more for physical prowess. So does the narwhal count as an animal with a horn despite this?

Fins like fish have wouldn't work for them.&quot;

But like if we extended this, that would mean that at larger and larger scales, water has less apparent viscosity. Does that mean a minnow feels water as being thicker than I do? A whale feels water as being thinner than I do? But they both have similar structures for locomotion. If I were 600 feet tall, would swimming in honey feel the same as me being 6 feet tall swimming in water?

There's just a lot of consequences to this statement that start to pop up if it is in fact true.

Text: Hello fellow science enthusiasts!
  

  
I've recently been fascinated by the concept of time dilation, a fundamental part of Einstein's Theory of Relativity. It's a mind-bending idea that time moves slower as you approach the speed of light or experience stronger gravity.
  

  
Now, we know that astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) are moving much faster than we are on Earth and experience a weaker gravitational pull. Over the course of their stay on the ISS, their clocks would tick slower relative to ours, but this effect is extremely tiny given the speeds and gravitational differences involved.
  

  
My question is: what tangible effects, if any, does this difference in the passage of time have on the astronauts' bodies and minds? Does it affect their biological clocks, circadian rhythms, or even the rate at which they age?
  

  
Also, on a psychological level, do astronauts report feeling any different in their perception of time? I've read reports of many astronauts experiencing what is known as the &quot;overview effect&quot;, a cognitive shift in their understanding of life and reality when viewing the Earth from space. Could changes in the passage of time contribute to this phenomenon in any way?
  

  
Thank you for your insights in advance! I'm excited to dive deeper into this topic.

- Or do we completely lose temperature variants between seasons, and it just stays cold all the time? 

2. What was going on in central and South America? Or Africa? Was it just business as usual for life down there? The regular flow of seasons and such, unaffected by the ice sheets?

Text: (This has been posted before in askhistory, but there wasn’t any responses)

Louis Pasteur’s germ theory came out in the 1860s, by then people were well in control of fermentation processes and were able to create distinct flavors without even knowing bacteria existed. What was their logic/reasoning behind their methods? 

For example if we mix a batch of bread dough too warm, we know the dough will ferment quickly because bacteria are more active in warmer environments. If a baker mixed dough too warm in 1820, what did he think was happening?

I know the properties of liquid CO2 obviously differ from water but how much of an impact could this still have ?

Text: Every time I try to research about lions, tigers, leopards and other big cats, I get so many conflicting answers about where they came from and which species was there first. 

For example: I have read that Cheetahs, Lions, leopards originated in Africa 3-4 million years ago, and after migrating to Asia, tigers evolved from leopards and only continued to migrate northeast and north west and never went to Africa. 

However, elsewhere I have read that tigers evolved first slightly over 2 million years ago from snow leopards, and lions and cheetahs did not evolve until after that in Africa, eventually having lions come to Asia. 

There are even more conflicting theories with dates differing in the millions, does anybody have a source that can answer this question with more accurate and research information? 

TLDR; What continent and time period did big cats originate, who came first to earth, tiger or Lion?

Thank you!

TEMPO, [which launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket earlier this month](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-high-resolution-air-quality-control-instrument-launches), will monitor and report on levels of nitrogen dioxide, aerosols, and other pollutants several times a day.

TEMPO is the first-ever space-based instrument to measure air pollution over North America and will transform the way scientists observe air quality from space. TEMPO's observations of pollutants will take place during daylight hours and will have incredible and unprecedented accuracy-down to four square miles.

This data will play an important role in how scientists study and analyze pollution, including studies of rush hour pollution, the potential for improved air quality alerts, the effects of lightning on ozone, how pollution spreads from forest fires and volcanoes, and even the effects of applying fertilizer.

Ask us anything about TEMPO!

Image: [EGM96 geoid map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid#/media/File:Earth_Gravitational_Model_1996.png)

It places one of the highest areas in the northern part of the Atlantic ocean.

The gravitational map from the GRACE mission depicts gravitational acceleration  on the Earth's surface due to the same variations:

Image: [Gravity anomalies on Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth#/media/File:Gravity_anomalies_on_Earth.jpg)

It places an area of high acceleration in the northern part of the Atlantic ocean.

In fact, all of the high sealevel areas correspond to areas of high gravitational acceleration, and vice versa.

I would have expected the opposite.

Why is this so? I am assuming the images are correct. Why would higher gravitational acceleration lead to higher sealevels instead of pulling the water closer to Earth's center and leading to lower sealevels?

Does this mean the final value  should have an uncertainty of ± 6cm^(3).

Virology/science has never been my strong point (I'm a financial advisor, so my strength is in finance/economics), so I don't understand how you don't get sick if you eat the diseased animal. Do our stomachs have some acids that breakdown certain viruses or something? Do viruses require special types of hosts to develop to the point it can affect humans?

Text: My knowledge of cancer is minimal so apologies in advance but from my basic understanding, cell division is constantly happening and when uncontrolled
growth happens it causes cancer. I also understand whenever you touch or do anything you are shedding loads of cells. If your body is replacing these cells, are ultra marathon runners or people who put their body under enormous stress for long periods where their body has to replace larger amounts of cells more susceptible then to cancer? Or is my understanding of cell division wrong?

Text: How did humans evolve lactose intolerance (lose the ability to digest lactose in adulthood)?   
I am not referring to how certain Eurasians, Africans, etc developed lactose tolerance in adulthood thousands of years ago. 

Instead, I am talking about how virtually all human babies are born lactose tolerant with the ability to product a lot of lactase enzymes to be able to drink and digest a lot of milk....but then a gene kicks in to turn off the lactase producing enzyme when they grow into older children/adults. Thus, I'm asking how and why the gene/traits/etc to turn off the lactase producing enzyme in adulthood evolved to create lactose intolerant adults when the default seems to be everyone starting out from a point of lactose tolerant babies.  


I've tried to research this myself, but everything I've found talks about how humans developed lactose tolerance in adulthood rather than how babies lost lactose tolerance when transitioning into adulthood.

Text: Tantalum-180m1 is the only primordial nuclear isomer, and is observationally stable, unlike its ground state which has a half life of about 8 hours.

According to Wikipedia, it has sufficient energy to decay in three ways: isomeric transition to the ground state of 180Ta, beta decay to 180W, and electron capture to 180Hf. However, no radioactivity from any decay mode of this nuclear isomer has ever been observed. Only a lower limit on its half-life of over 1015 years has been set, by observation. The very slow decay of 180mTa is attributed to its high spin (9 units) and the low spin of lower-lying states. Gamma or beta decay would require many units of angular momentum to be removed in a single step, so that the process would be very slow.

Compared to common Tantalum-181 which composes 99.98799% of natural Tantalum, 180mTa has a natural occurrence of 0.01201%.

It is thought to be created via photodisintegration of common Tantalum-181 causing neutron emission, so hypothetically more could be made by bombarding 181Ta with gamma rays. 

The closest thing to having a significant amount of 180mTa in one place right now would probably be in the Majorana Demonstrator, where 17.4 kilograms of pure Tantalum, including about 2.088 grams of 180mTa, are being observed in an effort to try to find the elusive decay of the isotope.

If 180mTa were extracted by isotope separation from 181Ta, would its metastability change anything about its properties? Unlike other nuclear isomers, appreciable amounts of it would be able to be created, separated, and gathered in one place without having to worry about it decaying into something else. Would its excitation energy cause anything bizarre, like increase its elasticity, or possess superconductivity?

Text: I often hear that probiotics can help with urinary tract infections and the vaginal microbiome. I also recently heard that they can help with/protect you from respiratory infections like COVID-19.

I am having a hard time imagining how this works. Am I missing something? Are these articles referring to oral gut probiotics (like yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, probiotic pills, etc.)? Or are they referring to a completely different kind of probiotics applied directly to the site? How could gut bacteria have an impact on the urinary tract, skin, vagina, lungs, etc? Do the gut bacteria stay in the gut or can they migrate to parts of the body (like the skin or urinary tract)? And do they have some kind of effect while in the gut that can somehow impact areas far away (like the respiratory system)? How does this work?

I am aware of the gut-brain connection claims, which make more sense to me, but some of these other claims seem strange to me.

I'm no geologist, but I've been in plenty of limestone caves to know these basic facts (which I'm spelling out so that I may be corrected if I'm operating on incorrect knowledge): Limestone is soluble in acid, and water is ever so slightly acidic (there's also a role played by microbes). A flow of water causes the slow dissolution  of the limestone over time, eventually carving a cave system.

Now salt is far more easily soluble than limestone in water, so there should have been vast natural caverns. And there is certainly water present under there, I saw it, and it needs to be pumped as in most mines.

Text: It seems like it’s a foregone conclusion nowadays that fractals and the Fibonacci sequence and golden ratio etc… are found in nature all over. 

But when I see examples, it doesn’t quite add up (to my admittedly ignorant mind) , I see spirals sure, but it’s not exactly the Fibonacci sequence

I see branches etc that are “reminiscent” of fractals, but they are *not* fractals because I thought fractals can’t exist in nature?

Just looking for some honest/open minded clarity.

Thank you.

Text: Do animals like dogs and cats.. Recognize their offspring or parents or siblings when it's been a long time? 

Like let's say you have a pedigree dog like your run of the mill golden retriever.  They all look extremely similar.  Let's say a litter of puppies all go to homes and they grow up and then 4 years later run into each other like in a dog park or something.  Would the dogs recognize each other as family?  Like would they know that's their mom or dad or sibling?
Like do the animals have some kinda scent they give off to know that this is my litter mate... Whereas they could run across another golden retriever completely unrelated and know that it's not their family?  Or let's say the other dog had the same parent dogs but not of the same litter, can they recognize the connection at least that they have the same parents?

Text: So after taking about like 6 different online color blind tests I figured out that I might have tritanomaly color blindness. While I understand I should probably see an eye specialist for a real diagnosis, I’m having a lot of questions popping up after reading about colorblindness. As long as I can remember I’ve just had this weird thing with some shades of blue where it just blurs everything around it. I never really thought much of it or even that I could be colorblind until recently. I know for sure that I am pretty severely night blind and so is my mother and I’m wondering if the two (night blindness and tritanomaly) are correlated or if it’s just a coincidence and they aren’t related at all. I’m also curious because to my knowledge my dad isn’t color blind (my born sex is female) and can see perfectly fine at night time as well.

Text: Hope its ok to post this here - was looking for input from those who understand the science of drugs, as I am trying to establish if one of my ADHD medications (prescribed) is prohibited from being brought into Japan (quite hard to get up to date accurate info).

\*\*Just to be clear, I am NOT going to use any info I am given here to determine if I can bring it with me, I am continuing to research this, trying to get in contact with relevant authorities etc, and unless I have confirmation from said authorities I will not bring it. This post is just to help set my expectations in the meantime!\*\*

The medication in question is **dexamphetamine** (brand name Amfexa) which I take in the afternoons.

I know that Adderall is not allowed under any circumstances - and this contains **amphetamine** and **dextroamphetamine.**

**Lisdexamphetamine** on the other hand, *is* allowed, as long as you get a special permit (This is what I take in the mornings).

You can see the full list of controlled substances and their categories [here](https://www.ncd.mhlw.go.jp/dl_data/keitai/list.pdf) \- Amphetamine is listed as a &quot;stimulant&quot; and strictly prohibited, lisdexamphetamine is listed as &quot;stimulant raw materials&quot; and as I say allowed with a permit. They don't actually specify dextroamphetamine or dexamphetamine anywhere.

When I search dexamphetamine, many of the search results come back with dextroamphetamine and it often doesn't seem to differentiate between them, some people also call Amfexa the &quot;UK Adderall&quot; as they are very similar (although Adderall is not licensesd here in the UK either)

So I was just wondering, is there a fundamental difference in them, in the same way that there is with lisdexamphetamine (which as I say is permitted). I know lisdexa is slow release, and dexa is instant, and the ban is presumably to do with preventing abuse. But I thought this was the reason Adderall isn't licensed in the UK, whereas dexa is commonly prescribed by psychiatrists.

Thanks in advance!

Text: Hi,  


So a little background. I have been working as a product manager in the ML space for a while. I enjoy the new technology and I think the new advancements done in LLM is really impressive. I know a little bit about the space, but the space is huge and I, of course, have been trying to understand things that is related to my work.  


However, I feel like we are jumping to some extreme conclusions when are talking about this subject. I hear in podcasts and on linkedin that with the recent improvements we can get better performance with algorithmic generated training data, and I've seen a few papers linked. I guess it looks legit, but I have not seen anyone smart explain what that means, to a non technical person like myself. People are very eager to take that truth and jump to the next conclusion built on top of this; &quot;with self improving algorithms we will be able to bla bla bla bla&quot;. 

So, if I understand things correctly, we need to tell the model what is good knowledge (training data), and we need to give one (or more) goal function(s) to optimize for (?). In the Sam Altman (OpenAI CEO) interview by Lex Fridman, Sam clearly states that they put a lot of effort into the pre-training data set (and is very non-talkative about the composition of the data, which I guess is probably one of the main company secrets). This is the knowledge that is put in to the model, this is where we tell it what is true (and potentially what is not true). We give it a, or a few, metrics to optimize for, and it finds the correct tuning on the parameters over the epochs of training. In ChatGPT's case it is also adding a human into the loop, to fine tune the model by giving two options and letting the human select the best version, also stated in the interview. 

If we conclude that we can generate better algorithmic output with algorithmically generated training data, what does that mean? To me it sounds like we can squeeze a little more performance of the model, not that we can feed the models infinitely, with better and better training data that it has produced. What is that data, even? What happened to the truths we fed the model?

What is the blue pigment in them? like the chemical formula and all that.

Other blue pigments include the blue blood of mollusks and crustaceans due to copper instead of iron but vertebrates have red blood so that's not it.

Another way blue chemicals form is by combining a pigment of a different color and a protein like the blue lobster or the blue starfish but I didn't read anywhere that this fish does it like that.

Text: This is a hard question to phrase, so hear me out:

I’m O- blood type, so I’m encouraged to donate. In time (within 120 days), I know my RBCs will die in the receiving patient, replaced by their own bone marrow generated RBCs. But my wife had an interesting question:

“Will any part of you remain in the baby (patient) forever?”

I think she was referring to literally anything on the microbiological level. Would my blood donation to an infant ever leave an imprint, even if incredibly insignificant?

Text: Children can have febrile seizures which scare a lot of parents. But I’ve learned that it’s usually benign and they get over it just fine. I think I also learned at some point that children can withstand higher fevers that might be fatal for adults. Is this true or am I remembering wrong? If true, what is it about children’s physiology that makes them more resilient?

Text: I am curious as to how metals are purified both artificially and naturally.    I roughly know how alloys are formed, one melts down metals then mix them together and that forms an alloy that has different properties than the individual metals.   Stainless steel is a common example of an alloy.   And in nature we know that veins of pure, or almost pure, metals form which is where we mine them from.   So what is the process of refining or seperating metals from each other as opposed to combining one another?

Text: I recently heard someone talking about the pill messing up the ability to read pheromones properly. Something about women being able to pick a mate that was high in certain things they were low in, except for the women on the pill. I’d never heard that before. Is that true? 


I have heard that it changes who you’re attracted to based on physical features ie. from testosterone levels, and looked at past questions here about it. So that does seem to happen, or at least be a likely hypothesis, but I’m also wondering how significant that effect is? Would that happen to every woman that takes it? And how strong an effect is it?

Text: During the Hadean period, which goes from Earth's formation 4.6B years ago to 4B years ago, Earth was bombarded by numerous meteorites, which brought most of its water. 

However, processes such as complete combustion and celular respiration create water, and photosynthesis destroys it. So, we have water being destroyed and new water being created all the time, essentially recicling our water.

This makes me think: how much of Earth's H2O is actually the same molecules that came to us through meteorites, and how much of it actually came from complete combustion?

Text: I completely understand how certain elements will preferentially form ionic bonds and enter the rock phase as lithophiles. I completely understand how other elements will preferentially form metallic bonds and enter the iron core as siderophiles. 

The distinction between ionic and metallic bonding is clear enough. 

But what is it about sulfur? Why do certain elements “love” sulfur but not oxide or silicate anions? What characteristic of the sulfide bond makes metal-sulfides behave different from ordinary ionic compounds? 

Does it have to do with sulfide being a larger, “softer” (more polarizable) anion than oxide?
