Text: How can you ensure that the one you want to condition ends up the one being conditioned?

To paint a hypothetical situation for an example, let's consider a child who starts out liking its teddy bear, but because that teddy bear was often present along with another (negative) stimulus, it began fearing or even hating the teddy bear. How can you determine which of the stimuli will be conditioned? 

And can you somehow &quot;force&quot; a particular one of them to be conditioned? Could you perhaps use that teddy bear to condition a negative stimulus (like fear of the dark) into a positive stimulus (eg. an apathy/ambivalence towards the dark, or perhaps even fascination with the dark)?

Text: It seems as if the [Toba Catastrophe Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toba_catastrophe_theory) is on the way out. From my understanding of the theory itself, a genetic bottleneck that occurred ~75,000 years ago was linked to the Toba VEI-8 eruption. However, evidence showing that societies and cultures away from Southeast Asia continued to develop after the eruption, which has seemed to debunk the Toba Catastrophe Theory.

However, that still doesn't explain the genetic bottleneck found in humans around this time. So, my question is, are there any theories out there that suggest what may have caused this bottleneck? Or has the bottleneck's validity itself been brought into question?

All the media and public health education literature states the virus spreads from “close skin to skin contact”. But what exactly does that entail on a microscopic level for the virus (or other viruses spreading like this)? 

Can this virus actually penetrate intact skin? For example if enough viral particles touch my forearm can it penetrate into my body? Or does it need to make contact eventually with a mucous membrane such as my mouth? 

As a secondary question: would good hand hygiene have a significant impact on prevention from contracting it?

Text: I have been thinking about trying some new ear plugs for concerts and really want to protect my hearing. 
**Do the high fidelity ones truly protect your ears better or do they just sound better than foam ear plugs that block more sound? My goal is hearing protection even if it cost some sound quality.**

What’s the difference between high fidelity ear plugs (Eargasm, Downbeats, Flare, etc.) and Mack’s foam ear plugs? 
Mack’s block out 32dB-38dB while most of the high fidelity brands I see only block 18-21 dB?

I understand you can supposedly hear the music clearer with the high fidelity plugs, but it let’s in more noise which seems like that would be more likely to damage your ears.

Thanks!

Everything makes sense, but it left me with some questions: how does the heat get released when a substance freezes? From my basic thermodynamics &quot;knowledge&quot;, molecules have kinetic energy that they transform by bumping into other molecules. But when a substance freezes, the molecules lose this kinetic energy - how? Energy cannot be destroyed, so where does it go? Do they suddenly &quot;black body radiate&quot; all of it away? Does it mean that they emit photons that transfer this energy away?

Text: We observe our world through the light visible to our eyes, however there are know organisms who see different wavelengths, bees for example can see ultraviolet light. Could there be planets where potential lifeforms might have to evolv to see x-rays or microwaves in order to observe their world?

If some planets received a different composition of light waves than ours I suspect it might be possible but I don't know if that is physically accurate. 

I know there are different types of stars and I know that the consensus is that a planet needs to be in the 'goldilocks zone' of a star to support life.

Text: Throughout geological time, higher temperatures have corresponded with wetter Earths. For a fairly recent and mild example, during the mid-Pliocene (when the world was 2-3°C higher then today), much of Central Asia and the Gobi Desert were grassland, as was Arabia and the US Southwest. However, with modern global warming, while some areas of the world are getting wetter and seeing more rainfall, these areas (and other arid and semi-arid ones) are seeing reductions in rainfall levels. Why is this? Shouldn't these areas be seeing increases in precipitation as the temperature rises?

Text: I'm an Assistant Astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) and an Associate Research Scientist at Johns Hopkins University. Here, I lead teams that focus on optimizing the scientific output from the JWST mission, with a particular focus on exoplanet atmospheric characterization, as well as teams focused on developing cutting-edge science for this exciting field of research using both ground and space-based facilities.

I participated on the team that produced the first images and data for JWST (the Early Release Observations ---- EROs) --- and led the analysis that produced the first exoplanet spectrum (of many to come!) that was shown to the public of the exoplanet WASP-96b. I'm also part of several teams working right now on producing the very first scientific results on exoplanet atmospheres with JWST, which range on exciting new science from highly irradiated, gas giant exoplanets all the way to the very first observations with JWST of the small set of terrestial planets orbiting the TRAPPIST-1 star.

I was recently featured as one of the experts in NOVA's documentary film, Ultimate Space Telescope, about the engineering behind the JWST. You can watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF-7eKtzAHM

Ask me anything about:

+ What are exoplanets? Why are they interesting to study with JWST?
+ What new frontiers will JWST explore in the field of exoplanet atmospheres?
+ What can JWST tell us about exoplanets orbiting stars other than the Sun? What can it tell us about our own planet?
+ What are the kind of results we should expect in this first year of JWST observations?
+ What can we expect for the future?

Before joining STScI, I was a Bernoulli Postdoctoral Fellow at the Max-Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany. In 2018, I was selected as the recipient of one of the prestigious IAU-Gruber fellowships by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) for my work on the field. I did both my undergrad (2012) and PhD (2017) at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, in Santiago, Chile, where I was born and raised.

I'll be on at 3pm ET (19 UT), AMA!

Text:  From Newsweek

&quot;NASA has spotted a bright solar flare erupting from the side of the sun, suggesting a particularly active solar region could be rotating this way.

The flare can be seen in the [video](https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/latest48.php?q=0304) above that was captured by [NASA](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nasa)'s Solar Dynamics Observatory on Sunday. In it, a contorted plasma structure can be seen moving on the left-hand side of the sun shortly before it erupts into space.

Solar flares are eruptions of electromagnetic radiation from the sun that travel at the speed of light. The increased levels of X-ray and extreme ultraviolet radiation carried by flares can have an effect on Earth's ionosphere—a region of the atmosphere containing electrically-charged particles.&quot;

[https://www.newsweek.com/nasa-solar-flare-erupts-sun-source-sunspot-1729706](https://www.newsweek.com/nasa-solar-flare-erupts-sun-source-sunspot-1729706)

Some articles are more sensationalist, suggesting that it could knock out radios and electrical devices.

What exactly does this mean from a scientific perspective, and what are the risks associated with it?

If it is unique to water, what about water causes it?

Text: The patellar tendon goes from behind your kneecap to the front of your tibia (shinbone) and can get painfully inflamed or partially torn, sometimes referred to as Jumper's Knee. One method of dealing with that pain is to wear a tight strap around the leg across that tendon just below the knee - the straps usually have a hard lump that presses down on the tendon.

Anecdotally (and personally), this seems to really reduce the pain. But why? Usually, pressing on an injury would hurt more, not less. Here, the strap's functionality seems to be purely mechanical - it's not some &quot;copper infused fabric&quot; or anything like that - cinching it tighter seems to improve the result (until it's so tight it's cutting off blood flow), and removing the strap immediately removes the benefit. Why does this apparently help, and why does pressure on the patellar tendon seem to make it more stable? Is it applicable to any other tendonitis injuries?

Text: First and foremost, apologies for the rudimentary question and with that, here is my question:

&amp;#x200B;

Embarrassingly, I've done this on more than one occasion and today got a bit of scalded.   Was heating up some oat milk (sometimes cows milk or plain water will also do this) in the microwave and when I put the frother in, the liquid starts to well up.   Is this due to the properties in the wand and or the temperature change?  The reaction is quite violent depending on how hot the liquid is.    


My palm is likely going to blister and require some time to heal.   I mentioned that it happened before so why haven't I learned my lesson?  Because it doesn't happen all the time which I'll put it to the temperature of the liquid.   9/10 times it has little to no reaction.   I think this time superheated it because due to the confluence of less liquid volume and the temperature of the wand which may have been colder than usual since the AC was on.

&gt;**Recombinant DNA is a technology scientists developed that made it possible to insert a human gene into the genetic material of a common bacterium**. This “recombinant” micro-organism could now produce the protein encoded by the human gene. Scientists build the human insulin gene in the laboratory.

Text: I've noticed this across several brands when I buy liquid paracetamol for my child. Bottles advertised for infants are 100mg/ml, whereas those for 1+ or 2+ yrs (brand dependent) are only around 24mg/ml.

The ratio depends on the brand but they're all roughly the same. Is there a biological/pharmacological rationale behind this? Suddenly having to give four times as much can be off-putting to a toddler who hates medicine (I'm lucky that we don't have that struggle at home, but the point stands).

It seems  more expensive to me, so I don't see the cost-saving angle.

Edit: both types come with syringes to dose, so it's not about precision of syringe vs cup/spoon.

Text: We are taught in 7th grade that mass is conserved. We are later taught that momentum and energy are conserved.

Up to a constant, these are roughly given by m\*v^(0), m\*v^(1), and m\*v^(2), respectively.

Of course, this is not exactly precise. Mass can become energy, kinetic energy can become potential, et cetera.

I know that the latter two of these come from Noether's theorem and symmetries of the universe (resp. spacial and time translation). But I've also heard about violations of various symmetry, though I'm not a physicists so I often don't really understand the details.

So, I have a few questions, hopefully all somewhat related to this introduction and the title question.

Is there a symmetry/condition under which m\*v^(3) is conserved? Is there a (violated?) symmetry from which we could derive conservation of mass? What about m\*v^(n)? 

And I suppose this is maybe a bit more tangential, but when we say a symmetry is violated, what does that actually say about the universe? If time crystals show that time translational symmetry is &quot;violated&quot; does that mean we are wrong to assume time translational symmetry elsewhere? Or is it a matter of &quot;well, as far as we can tell, everything else is still time symmetric&quot;?

Text: I've been quite fascinated all my life about the original Severn Bridge, which is around 40 miles from where I live. Last week I was able to get the opportunity to walk across it and found it surprisingly stable. Something that seems fairly unique about the Severn Bridge compared to most suspension bridges around the world would be that its cables are in a diagonal, almost triangular pattern, rather than being vertical like on most other suspension bridges. The Humber Bridge in the UK also uses the same unusual diagonal cable design that the Severn Bridge uses, yet for some reason the vast majority of large suspension bridges built outside the UK in the past 50 years still use the traditional vertical cable design, despite it seeming less stable. The timelapses I've seen of most suspension bridges that use vertical wires seem to have noticeably more deck movement than the few with diagonal/triangular cables.

I've done some experiments with different bridge designs in the free piece of software Bridge Designer 2016, and found that giving a bridge the diagonal/triangular cable layout found on the Severn and Humber Bridges in the UK made it much more stable than the same design with traditional vertical cables. Since this seems to be the case, is there a reason why the majority of suspension bridges outside of the UK have continued to be built with the more traditional layout? I know that the Severn Bridge was a world first in its use of diagonal/triangular cables, but any patents that may have been registered during its design and construction would have almost certainly expired by the mid-late 1980s (it was opened in 1966).

Text:  

Greetings! I am relatively new to Chemistry and the natural sciences overall, and have a question regarding molecules vs ions.

To   my understanding, molecules are always neutral as they are not the   compound of two charged atoms (+ or -), but rather the fusion of two   neutral atoms. Ions, however, are the other way around, and the more   ions you add (polyatomic ions), it will flip between being neutral or   charged. But, how then, can water (H2O) be dipolar? Perhaps I have   understood the concept of polarity wrong. If the molecules are neutral   as neither the Hydrogen or Oxygen atoms are charged, how can the   water-molecule have two sides? Or is it for this very reason that it has   two sides, simply because it is the fusion of two neutral atoms?

On  a  similar topic, I must also ask the difference between ionic bonding  and  molecular formation ... The ions, of course, attract other charged   atoms (other ions), because the valence-electrons wish to jump over to   differently charged ions since atoms strive to have a full outer shell.   But, molecules do not do this, do they? How are they different? Are  they  simply the combination of two atoms, in which the electrons do not   leave their respective atoms, but rather join together in an &quot;orbital   fusion&quot; in which they can travel freely (until broken up)? This would   make sense since they are not charged, and therefore have no attraction   to leave their own atoms for opposing ones.

I am very thankful for answers! Good day :)

Text: Say if you have two objects with mass in space. They’re far enough apart that gravity in between them is negligible. So as the expansion of space continues, the two objects would become further and further apart. Wouldn’t that mean the energy it requires for them to come together would keep increasing?

Am I missing something?

Text: I often find myself curious about the types of rock and erosion thereof that I come across in life. I know it's kind of a niche thing but I don't really know where to look to find out why specific land features are the way they are on a local basis.. Like how did these rocks get all wavy and why do they differ from all the other rocks in the area? Why do the rocks across from them on the road seem to be a totally different type of rock, and why do they seem to manifest an entirely different type of erosion?

Things like that. I've always wished there was a sort of Google maps type thing made specifically for unique geologic features.. Is there at least a database that has these things listed where I could get these kinds of questions answered?

Text: My kids were asking me why high altitude is colder than lower. The answer, I understand, is that the air is thinner. The thinner the air, the fewer air molecules colliding with your body and therefore less energy transferred to your body, and therefore colder. (correct?)

But that got me thinking. Air is a good insulator, compared to, say, the ground, because it is a gas and therefore less dense, and therefore provides less capacity for heat transfer, right? So as you get higher and the air gets thinner and thinner, wouldn't this insulating property INCREASE? If so, wouldn't your body would retain more of its heat as you went higher and therefore feel warmer, not colder? 

But experience shows this isn't true. The top of Mount Everest is definitely colder than the base. Why? What am I missing about this relationship between gas / density / heat / warmth?

While they seemed to thrive elsewhere, they eventually went extinct in the Americas until being reintroduced by Europeans in the 1500s.  Since then, wild horse populations have again thrived in the new world.  So, why were they wiped out, and why did this not effect Eurasian horses?

From what I understand bicephaly in reptiles is typically caused by either genetic or environmental factors, the most common being abnormal incubation temperatures. I was wondering if there is any sort of physical trauma that could result in bicephaly, such as an egg being dropped or slightly damaged? If so, would it be possible for scientists to make a notch in a developing embryo and encourage bicephaly? I know it's kind of morbid, but I was really curious as to whether or not physical environmental factors have an impact on this since I couldn't find many sources surrounding it!

We're aware of the risks and big events that are possible with solar cycle maximums, but since a lot of news stories sound like they're trying to convince us that the sun is about to kill us all, we're looking for something a little bit more nuanced to give us some perspective. My friend is interested in astronomy but *also has astrophobia* so has been looking for something a little more reassuring than articles constantly popping up on his social media recommendations that exaggerate for clicks.

What should we actually expect, and what should we look for in news articles to tell us what we actually need to know?

Text: DNA and RNA are typically &quot;read&quot; in groups of 3 that we call codons. Each of those combinations of bases codes for a specific (but not necessarily unique) protein or other &quot;instruction&quot;, like start and stop. The entire collection of codons in a genome, in their particular order, &quot;defines&quot; an organism, so to speak. 

But where are the codons themselves defined? What determines which groups of 3 bases results in which amino acids? Is it included in the genome itself, like a compiler written in its own programming language? Or is it entirely reliant on the cellular machinery already existing from the parent with the codons pre-determined? I know there are some examples of different codons between different species but also that it's mostly the same among all life; has it really just been passed down through the unbroken chain of reproduction without ever being encoded?

Text: **What are you doing to get clean air?**

As the fear of airborne illnesses has heightened, people have understandably become much more concerned about potentially contagious strangers and are choosing to go where high air quality standards are maintained. Conventional approaches have been focused on making filters tighter, but filter media can only be made so small before becoming difficult to move air effectively or efficiently. Reducing nanoparticles by agglomerating them into larger, aggregated clusters is the key. Larger particles are more easily mitigated and fall to the ground more quickly. [Atmofizer](https://atmofizer.com/) is leading 4th generation in air technology, with patented agglomeration tech using acoustic pressure waves to reduce airborne nanoscopic particles-without using filters and saving our landfills! Another benefit we hear is the reduction of odors, including strong smoke odors like cannabis. Cleaner air apparently smells a lot better too!

Text: When I say brains I don't mean the conscious, higher-thinking portion of our brain, but the more instinctual part that does stuff like vomiting or fear.

This is a kind of specific question, but anecdotally, I see a lot of stories about people getting food poisoning, and if they know where they got it from (say, potato salad), they end up hating it, even if they loved it before. They often say that it's gross and have a very visceral reaction to it, and from what I can tell, not a voluntary one.

In a similar but slightly different vein, I'm a spheksophobe (wasps), but didn't start being more than wary of them until I had an allergic reaction to them in primary school (not anaphylaxis or anything, it was called a &quot;severe localized reaction&quot; by a doctor but it made me sick for a week). I get pretty nervous and grossed out looking at photos of them, and heaven forbid I am within ten feet of one, but no amount of convincing myself can make me not scared or sick-feeling.

Is this the subconscious brain recognizing that something made us sick after the fact and making us avoid it with a physical and emotional reaction? Or is it our conscious brain remembering what happened and the association is what makes the physical and emotional reaction?

Is it related to the thing where people who had cancer as kids wouldn't be able to stand ice cream because they were given it a lot during chemo, and they had to stop giving childhood cancer patients ice cream because of it?

If any of you have a resource like a PubMed article or something similar, I'd love to read it.

And, additional question: Do particles of different materials get filtered with different probabilities - since they differ in mass and probably in their suface - , or is the particle material irrelevant and it's only about the size?

Was it something that was deliberately selected during the breeding process thousands of years ago, or are white coats a side effect of other trait selections during the domestication process?

Text: Last April, I was visiting family in Florida when a friend, who works in health care, showed me a memo that she received from the state Department of Health, offering scientific explanation for why gender-affirming care should be denied to children in the state.

I started clicking the links in the memo, and reading what the evidence they were citing actually said. It seemed like they were using those citations in bad faith-that the science actually said something other than what the state said the research says.
And so, I reached out to to the doctors whose work Florida was holding up as rationale for banning transgender medicine for minors. Ten doctors all told me that they didn't know Florida was citing their work - and that Florida is distorting their scientific work to push an anti-transgender (and anti-science) agenda.

Earlier this month, my colleagues at VICE News and I published an investigation of our findings, showing that this is part of a larger pattern of Gov. DeSantis's administration going to extreme ends - including lying to health care providers - to block transgender kids from getting the health care they need and deserve.

I'll be on at 2pm ET (14 UT), AMA!

For example, how many holes does a 3 way pipe join have? Or a 4 way cross pipe join? Or like in the title if you had a pipe with a hole connecting to the inside area does that mean it topologically have 1, 2 or 3 holes?

My question is... If we were to compare the global number of mosquitoes+ants+flies living in a general area, would human action have significant influence on their number or no?

Arguments for yes: we (humans) are very invasive, and pesticides are powerful.

Arguments for no: the houses' area are insignificant compared to the wooded/grassy area. More over, we are creating a nutrition-rich environment for these insects and that's why they are around us. So we are killing as many as we produce.

Conversely, not setting an alarm allows us to wake up in the most natural and gradual way, but is perhaps not very practical and results in an unstable rhythm.

Which waking method would be better for getting optimal sleep?

Text: The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease says that the accumulation of the peptide amyloid-β in the brain is the main cause of the disease. However, after decades of research and clinical trials there has been little to no success in treating Alzheimer's patients based on this hypothesis, and it has been questioned, see for example:

It was recently reported that some western blot images which claim to show a sub-type of amyloid beta, Aβ\*56, may have been manipulated. The report was the result of an investigation by *Science*:

Such manipulations the report claims go back to the original 2006 paper describing Aβ\*56 in *Nature*  written by Sylvain Lesné and Karen Ashe:

From the report in *Science* one may get the impression that the vast majority of Aβ plaque-related research and drug development since then has been focused on the Aβ\*56 subtype, in which case the alleged fraud would be an enormous setback to the field, with billions of dollars and decades of research time wasted. However, there are many types of Aβ and I'm unclear on just how important Aβ\*56 is to the field of Alzheimer's research and drug development. My initial thought was that there's no way all this time, effort, and money has been invested in something that only one lab has published (even if they've published on it many times) and no independent researchers have validated. The *Science* report says that some others have detected Aβ\*56 but I don't know in what context, or if this other work validates the work from Lesné and Ashe:

&gt;In the 16 years following the landmark paper, Lesné and Ashe—separately or jointly—published many articles on their stellar oligomer. Yet only a handful of other groups have reported detecting Aβ\*56.

An article on Alzforum has comments from some of the scientists involved in the controversy:

&gt;[Sylvain Lesné, Who Found Aβ*56, Accused of Image Manipulation](https://www.alzforum.org/news/community-news/sylvain-lesne-who-found-av56-accused-image-manipulation)

In particular, the top comment which is from Karen Ashe, the senior author on the original 2006 paper:

&gt;...it is clear that there are two general forms of Aβ, type 1 and type 2. One particular form of type 1 (referred to in our papers as Aβ\*56 and in the Science article as “toxic oligomers”) was shown by my lab and others to impair memory function in mice. The type 2 form of Aβ is the one found in amyloid plaques. It is this latter form that drug developers have repeatedly but unsuccessfully targeted. There have been no clinical trials targeting the type 1 form of Aβ...

Scientific misconduct or fraud is of course terrible, and if true I'm sure this has set back at least some progress in the field. But just how significant is this fraud if it's true?

I think the size of both sets are the same? For Cantor's diagonal argument, if you match up every integer with a real number (btw is it even possible to do so since the size is infinite) and create a new real number by changing a digit from each real number, can't you do the same thing with integers?  


Edit: For irrational numbers or real numbers with infinite digits (ex. 1/3), can't we reverse their digits over the decimal point and get the same number? Like &quot;0.333...&quot; would correspond to &quot;...333&quot;?

Text: Let say at some point somebody is born with a beneficial mutation (e.g. darker skin in region with a lot of sunlight). If they mate with someone from the original population, this mutation is only partially noticeable in the children (e.g.children of mixed race parents are not as dark/light as their parents). And when these children have children of their own with partners of the population-without-mutation the trait is even less present 
You can see where this is going... the mutation gets   'dilluted' over the different generations. 

Obviously,  mutations do spread over a population. But how?

Neutrons however are scaled by their energy, for 10 - 100keV it would be 10, for 100keV - 2MeV it is 20. But for neutrons with an energy of 2 - 20MeV the factor goes back down to 10.

My question is, why's that? Shouldn't the &quot;destructive&quot; effects increase with energy?

Text: Edit: please read what I say about Japan and Korea as well. Everyone refuting Chinese statistics needs to explain those countries. Both have higher female smoking rates and similar pollution per capita. 


So I was reading this article https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/sep/10/cancer-breakthrough-is-a-wake-up-call-on-danger-of-air-pollution and they said that there were 300k cases of lung cancer globally per year and 6000 were in the UK. And I thought to myself well damn, the UK is less than 1% of world population how do they account for 2% of lung cancer patients? 

Then the article goes on to say that this is in part due to air pollution.  But I have lived in both China and the UK and well the UK has clean air. Also about 40% of people smoke in China vs less than 15% in the UK. So shouldn't China have more than 300k cases of lung cancer a year just given it's smoking statistics vs UK? 

So I looked everything up and, from the answers google gave, I seemed to be getting my statistics pretty close. As I can tell, we aren't talking about death due to lung cancer,  we are talking diagnosis per 100k. So why are so many fewer people diagnosed with lung cancer in China vs the UK? And does this throw doubts on this research?

Also, just to follow up I looked up lung cancer rates in South Korea and Japan, other countries I have lived in which both suffer chronic high pollution rates (mostly due to Chinese drift pollution) as well as very high levels of smokers. To my surprise both countries had statistics in line with China's. This makes me inclined to not believe that these are just China hiding its numbers.

Text: In the last 200 million years, we had only one mass extinction : K-Pg extinction and that too is largely attributed to the astroid impact (an outside factor). Whereas before that, there were series of mass extinctions and collapses at much regular interval like we had Triassic extinction around 201 MYA, Permian extinction around 251 MYA, Carboniferous rainforest collapse around 300 MYA and Devonian extinctions between 375 and 360 MYA. These are mainly attributed to earth systems.

Is it just a coincidence that the number of big extinctions have came down or has the earth became better for life? I’m aware that we did had extinctions like the one at end of Last Glacial Maximum but I don’t think any were that drastic compared to what Earth used to have earlier.

Edit : I see lot of comments that I ignored the ongoing 6th mass extinction. Well, yes because I’m more interested in understanding this from the perspective of (natural) factors which caused the other extinctions mentioned like plate tectonics, volcanic activity etc.  So, please ignore the human effect as it takes this question in an entirely different direction. Apologies for not clarifying this earlier.

Text: Recently, I've been looking at the way pharmaceutical and food-grade phosphorous-based compounds such as [phosphoric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoric_acid) are made. Wikipedia says high-purity phosphorous is produced via the [&quot;dry&quot;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoric_acid#Dry_process) or [&quot;thermal&quot; process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus#Thermal_process), in which [phosphate minerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate_mineral) \- in this example, [fluorapatite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorapatite) \- are reduced with [coke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coke_(fuel)) and [silicon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_dioxide) in an [electric arc furnace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_arc_furnace), producing phosphorous, [carbon monoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide), [calcium silicate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_silicate)\-based slag, and [calcium fluoride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_fluoride), as in the below equation:

`4 [Ca`^(5)`(PO`^(4)`)`^(3)`F] + 18 [SiO`^(2)`] + 30 [C] → 3 [P`^(4)`] + 30 [CO] + 18 [CaSiO`^(3)`] + 2 [CaF`^(2)`]`

However, this reaction uses coke (the '30 \[C\]' in the equation), [the production of which relies upon fossil fuels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coke_(fuel)#Production), which there's a limited supply of.

[Apparently, however, it's possible to produce steel while using hydrogen gas in the place of coke](https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottcarpenter/2020/08/31/swedish-steelmaker-uses-hydrogen-instead-of-coal-to-make-fossil-free-steel/?sh=72a1f56e2c8b) \- more expensive, but doable and more eco-friendly.

**The question: would it be possible to produce pharmaceutical and food-grade phosphorous while using hydrogen or some other** [**diatomic**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic_molecule) **gas in the place of coke - say, with one of the reactions below?**

`4 [Ca`^(5)`(PO`^(4)`)`^(3)`F] + 18 [SiO`^(2)`] + 30 [H`^(2)`]`

`4 [Ca`^(5)`(PO`^(4)`)`^(3)`F] + 18 [SiO`^(2)`] + 30 [N`^(2)`]`

`4 [Ca`^(5)`(PO`^(4)`)`^(3)`F] + 18 [SiO`^(2)`] + 30 [O`^(2)`]`

I'm aware apatites will also run out eventually, and that silica-containing sand is also in high demand worldwide - I'm just wondering if the process of turning apatites into phosphorus could be disconnected from fossil fuel use. I'm also aware that there are non-fluorapatite [phosphate minerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate_mineral) out there, and that the calcium fluoride in 1st equation is only there because the [feedstock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material) is an [apatite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatite) that includes calcium and fluorine. I'm just using fluorapatite as an example.

Text: I read this article and I'm confused: https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/world/thwaites-doomsday-glacier-sea-level-climate/index.html

From my understanding, the risk of glaciers melting causing sea level rise is specifically with regard to glaciers on land, who would either fall off completely, thus displacing large amounts of water, or slowly melt into the ocean, which adds water to the ocean level.

However, I'm struggling to understand the physics of this specific case - it mentions the glacier is anchored to the sea bed. Thus, is it essentially acting as if it is NOT displacing any water? And if it entirely eroded from beneath, the sea level would thus have to rise to accommodate the displacement of the now floating glacier?

If so, why is it different if a glacier is anchored (I.e connected to the sea bed with presumably no water in between the sea bed and bottom of glacier, as opposed to that very same glacier without being anchored? What about if we assume 99.99% of the glacier bottom was eroded and theoretically that 0.01% of glacier could hold it attached to the sea floor, would it still act the same as if it was 100% anchored and not floating?) 

Thanks for helping my understanding.

Text: From what I understand, molecules bond with each other to form solids, possibly meaning to myself, that molecules only pull each other. 

Suppose you compress a piece of wood along its cross-section. What I imagine is that compressing them will only push and slide the molecules apart, which causes them to get pulled apart until the force exceeds their tensile strength resistance, same with shearing action, where the &quot;knife&quot; only pushes the cross-section of an object, causing that cross-section to be pulled apart from other cross-section. 

That's what I'm curious about.

Text: Griffths says that in the case of an orthonormal basis, the inner product of two vectors can be written very neatly in terms of their components...

&lt;a|b&gt;=a1\*b1+a2\*b2+....+an*bn 

But in order to know if a set is orthonormal or not we need to be able to calculate the dot product &lt;e_i|e_j&gt; and check if it is equal to del(ij) without actually being able to represent them (basis vectors) by some n-tuple of &quot;components with respect to another prescribed basis&quot;..., right? Otherwise we just get stuck in a never ending infinite staircase, isn't it?

So how do we do that? How do we know if the basis is orthonormal? In 3d real vector space we can just talk about projections(we can just visualise the thing) I know.... but how does this projection idea generalise to higher dimensional and also complex vector spaces without having to talk about an inner product?

Text: Summary: Large solid chunk of steel submerged in a solution of copper(ii) sulfate and tin(ii) sulfate (estimated ration of 10-1). Left to sit for 24 hours. Reaction expected to produce precipitates of metallic copper and tin and a solution of iron(ii) sulfate.

Question: Would the copper and tin precipitate out as a metallic alloy, or would they come out as separate layers, crystals, etc.. ?

So... I've been messing around with copper(ii) sulfate for the past few days. One of my ongoing experiments started with putting scrap electronics solder in a solution of the stuff. My idea was the tin and lead would replace the copper and leave a solution of pure tin(ii) sulfate and insoluble lead(ii) sulfate and copper metal. The results were promising as I was left with a beautiful turquoise blue solution along with white precipitate of lead(ii) sulfate and copper collecting on the old solder. My only mistake was that I did not have enough solder, and so the resulting solution was still mostly copper(ii) sulfate.

It was this mixture of tin(ii) sulfate and copper(ii) sulfate that I added a slightly rusted steel hammer head to. I honestly didn't have a plan at this point other then a quick google search to see where iron was in terms of reactivity. Success on that: I now have an almost pure solution of iron(ii) sulfate. I will likely continue using sulfate to juggle metal ions with reckless abandon.

It's the hammer head I sacrificed that I'm really curios about. It's completely covered in copper crystals and I'm pretty certain the tin is mixed in as well. I'll link a picture in the comments. I really want to know if I just accidentally made a copper-tin alloy.

Text: I know why the weather forecast for 2 weeks away is usually worthless, and ~3 days is the max at which we can get a pretty good to get an estimate of the weather. But what about going in the opposite direction? Short period, precise location, precise weather?

I know the weather for my city for today is intermittent rains, about 50% cloud coverage. But why can't I find out if my street address will have sun or rain in half an hour? It's currently raining. Does it make sense to wait for it to stop within next hour or so, or should I call a taxi home?

I can find &quot;possible thunderstorms in the evening&quot; a day ahead, but I can't tell if I have 15 minutes to roll my BBQ and hide before everything's drenched, or the heavy dark clouds I see rolling over the city will pass me to the side and leave my area dry. 

With current technology it feels like it *should* be easy enough to predict weather for a specific spot. Sure there will still be situation when the prediction is uncertain; the cloud passes just by, it may go 200m west or 200m east from me and I'll get rain or not. But in most cases it should be perfectly predictable that a cloud raining here, moving in this direction, at this speed, will rain there, in x minutes, and with this size it will take that many minutes to pass.

Text:  

Hi All,

If Climate Change were fake, then it should be easy to prove it by showing that CO2 does not, in fact, convert more light to heat energy as it passes through. They've known about the concept of a &quot;greenhouse gas&quot; for a century, though.

My question is, what is this property of a gas called?

It will be more complicated that just a constant value, because it will be dependent on the particular light wavelengths involved, but it must have a name.

Thanks!

Text:  A large portion of our already oversized brains is used for coordinating our limbs. This makes some sense since there is a lot of &quot;math&quot; that needs to be worked out for the inverse kinematics of something as simple as buttoning a button. But how do small animals, like spiders, manage complex tasks with comparatively few brain cells. Brains are costly in terms of metabolism and evolution is not wasteful. So I am assuming there is a reason why we require literally billions of CNS neurons to coordinate our limbs while spiders get by on just tens of thousands.

Text: Hello! First post here so bear with me.
So, ever since I recovered from covid in May 2021, I've had this long covid wheezing and coughing it's not extreme just a little bit don't worry, anyway I was thinking, I just woke up from a night's sleep and I was coughing last night and now this morning. Why do we not cough in our sleep? Does coughing require consciousness? Or is it something else, maybe it could be related to our breathing patterns? Like when you try taking deep breaths to stop wheezing but cough bad while you exhale? Idk, I don't have anything near a biology background. 
Thank you in advance!
Ps:This may or may not be a stupid question so again, bear with me.

I was told recently that if your flame burns blue, it doesn't produce carbon monoxide (or not nearly as much as yellow). I don't see how that would work. The color of a flame (in a commercial gas combustion) is dependent on its temperature, I can imagine maybe, if your flame's yellow it partially burns the gas supplied, leading to more gas in the air, but certainly not carbon monoxide, no?

Text: I've heard with the Omicron variant, people were mentioning that it has become less deadly, which evolutionary speaking, helps it spread more.  I've also heard a similar account for Influenza - that the Spanish Flu became much more 'mild' (relatively speaking) simply because it was more 'fit' if it had a lower mortality rate.

I'm wondering how this relates with regards to other diseases.  For example, is this a factor in what made the successive black plague outbreaks less deadly (with the first one in the mid-14th century being infamously horrible)?  And not to downplay how bad smallpox or measles is today, but was there a time when it was even deadlier, and has since become less deadly?  Or do some diseases always stay at some mortality rate?

Edit: I should add I'm interested because my &quot;common understanding&quot; of why the black plague became less bad is acquired immunity.  But given this recent insight from COVID-19, I'm wondering if this &quot;evolving to less deadly&quot; was relevant for the black plague as well.  And as well for other diseases...

Text: I am talking about the pill which if I understand correctly prevents ovulation which is why one cannot get pregnant. I also know (presume?) a woman is born with all the eggs she will ever have, and menopause happens when a woman &quot;runs out of eggs&quot;. If this is true then shouldn't there be a backup of eggs for a woman to use if they never go through the full process and get released?

I am aware menopause only happens in a few mammalian species: the great apes, orcas, elephants, etc. So perhaps there is some sort of biological clock in our brains?

Text: Apologies in advance for the (probably) stupid question. I don't know much about science but I'm really curious. I'm not quite sure how to articulate my question without a scientific background but I'm going to try to verbalize what I'm thinking as best I can. Thank you in advance! 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering if epigenetic changes show up and make a difference in DNA. I'm not very good at science, but I know personal gene expressions can change over the years and I was curious if that would be representative in raw DNA sample files. Should people re-submit a DNA sample if they good through significant changes over the years, or would the raw data remain the same? 

&amp;#x200B;

Say, for example, someone submits a DNA sample to 23andme or a similar website, and at the time they are very active and muscular, and at an average weight. If that same person were to submit a new DNA sample a decade later and were overweight and sedentary at the time of the new test, would the raw DNA change?

In general, does the photovoltaic process actually take away from the heat generated from absorbed light in a material? I realize it's probably a negligible amount at the end of the day but I've always been curious if, in generating electricity, a photovoltaic manages to circumvent (at least some of) the relevant photon's energy being translated into heat, and if possible how it managed to do so.

A few of my wife's friends also had it and although it was self diagnosed we all tested negative for covid so it seems a good guess.  Meanwhile my 3 year old never had any symptoms and I had a mild cough and felt a bit achy but wasn't anything close to bed bound and was happy working, cooking, cleaning and even managed a couple of 10 mile bike rides (my usual route is 15 miles but I felt a bit tired).  In fact at 44 years old I have never been bed bound for more than a morning.

Most people tend to say if you can get out of bed it's not flu, but is that true or can you have flu and have no/ mild symptoms?

****Obviously I'm aware it was self diagnosed and it may be none of us had flu but had something else, I'm just interested if flu is always as bad as people say.

I'm asking about a planet's core in particular because there's more mass around it than inside it, therefore it should be logical that it is being pulled outwards, not inwards.

But once one stumbles upon it - beware - 5 or 10 of her friends will be arriving shortly.

Do wasps (outside the nest) really have a means of communicating with one another and calling others when they've found a tasty food source? If so, how?

Text: My understanding is that when cohort life expectancy grows, period life expectancy lags because period life expectancy is measuring life expectancy of all existing cohorts, whereas life expectancy for the new, youngest cohorts would be expected to be higher.

We've just gone through a pandemic where period life expectancy declined in the US two years in a row. Presuming SARS-Cov-2 doesn't go away, and we have a new added cause of death at 2021/2022 rates, would we expect a similar downwards lag? 

I'm wondering if we would expect period life expectancy to stay the same as it was in 2021, other things equal? Or would it continue to decline further?

Text: Assume a person weighs 100kg. They then have a limb immobilized due to injury or other causes, which results in muscle loss from that limb. If their TDEE (total daily energy expenditure, or base metobolic rate + calories burned from activity) remains the same as it was before the muscle loss, will they lose weight? or just lose muscle while maintaining the same weight?

Intuitively I would think that there would either be no change to the persons weight, or maybe even a slight increase since muscle burns more calories at rest than fat which would result in a lower BMR/TDEE. Unless there is some change to metabolism, if calories in = calories out before and after the muscle loss, we would expect no or little weight loss.

Is this assumption correct? why or why not? And if it is, where does the mass that was previously caused by muscle end up?

Text: I’ve always heard the explanation “because the planet curves away from the moon as fast as it falls towards the planet” but this doesn’t make sense to me. The moon is not falling “down” relative to a universal plane, it is falling straight towards the center of the planet.

Why does the moon not fall towards the planet in a spiral pattern? How does the moon’s momentum “counteract” the constant force of gravity?

If we compare it to a tennis ball on a rope, the tennis ball also does not fall towards the center despite the rope pulling on it, even if the rope is being flexed strongly outwards. But this is because the person is swinging the ball on the rope, providing a constant force tangential to its “orbit.”

A moon orbiting a planet has only one force on it: gravity. There is no tangential force, only tangential motion to to its momentum. How does only its momentum keep it afloat?

Text: I've read that Monkey Pox isn't an STD. So why is MSM, allegedly, the most afflicted group according to the WHO?

Edit: Unfortunately, I feel that the answers aren't clear enough and I still have doubts.

I understand that Monkeypox isn't strictly an STD, and it's mainly transmitted by skin-to-skin contact and respiratory secretions during prolonged face-to-face contact. So, I still don't understand why are the media and health organizations focusing specifically on the MSM demographic.

Even if the spread, allegedly, began in some sort of gay event, any person, regardless of sexual orientation,  could eventually get infected with Monkeypox. It's not as if MSM only had contact with other MSM. They might also spread the disease to their heterosexual friends, coworkers, acquaintances, and relatives.

In the worst-case scenario in which we aren't able to contain Monkeypox, LGBT people who don't even participate in random sexual encounters or social gatherings might get infected by heterosexual carriers.

Shouldn't the narrative be changed to &quot;people who partake in hook-up culture and large social events&quot;? What does sexual orientation have to do with the spread of the disease?

Edit2: I'm reading an alarming number of baseless assumptions and stereotypes about MSM or gay men in general, I honestly thought this subreddit was much better.

Now the first time I saw them I learnt more about Jeremy - a sinister/left coiled snail due to a rare genetic issue(he's like a 1% chance mutation, probs less) - and learned ofc that Sinister snails can't usually mate with Dextral snails and so Sinisters need sinister mates.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_(snail)

NOW. Here comes my question. I see a few Redditors posting in various subs also witnessing Slex(slug-sex) for the first time but HERE is my issue;

Every time I see the slugs coiled up in their coitus - they seem to be chirally inclined to coitus that up the same way.

Now, if snails are Herms but can be sinister on occasion and only mate with Sinisters - is there any chirality of existence in slugs too? Just like you can be a sinister snail instead of a standard and usual Dextral - are there sinister slugs out there who can't find a mate befause they keep just finding dextrals who like it left to right rather than the kinky right to left and they are doomed, like Jeremy(without the intervention of science and human matchmaking) to never ever get their rocks off and have kids, unless their 1% existence chances on another slug of 1% existence as two equally sinister beings???

Text: From what I've seen, hydrogen is a more energy dense fuel than anything else (disregarding things like nuclear fuel), and the fact that the oxidation reaction is 'pure' (in that the only byproduct is chemically stable water) leads me to believe there's no more energy to be gained from the reaction. That said, I have little knowledge of chemistry. Perhaps a fuel with an accelerant (or whatever the correct term may be) other than oxygen has a greater density?

Text: I read that Si and GaAs, which are both used as semiconductors in computer chips, develop a very thin oxidation layer in air. I also read that the one that Si develops is insoluble in water, so it is a good passivation layer, while the one that GaAs develps contains water soluble oxides, so it is not a good passivation.

On the other hand in the industry, the GaAs oxidation layer is etched off with acid, when GaAs wafers are used - why is this done, and not just water used, if the oxides are water soluble? And how can I imagine the oxide layer itself, is it something that is firmly &quot;bonded&quot; to the GaAs or Si underneath, or is it something more &quot;volatile&quot; that is easily removed? As in: is it really part of the surface, or just &quot;lying on top of it&quot;?

I'm not a chemist, I just read a lot about semiconductor materials recently and am curious.

And what do the sperm whales do when they sleep in this strange buoyant way ? how do they stay buoyant while sleeping ?

Or do they just &quot;overpower&quot; the density change with muscle power ?   


This might be a bit of a convoluted question but maybe someone has some expertise in the area. Thanks :)

Text: I've been watching a lot of YouTube videos and reading a lot about criticality (and the various incidents and accidents around the world) and mostly thanks to the Managing The Atom YouTube channel I am getting closer to understanding, But there is still one thing just can't quite understand.

I understand that certain things are &quot;radioactive&quot; to a lesser or greater degree. What I don't understand yet is that if a material is subcritical, is it possible to be in a room with that material without being adversely affected due to the low amount of radiation? If more and more material is added bringing a closer to criticality does the amount of radiation increase slowly making my proximity to the material more dangerous, or does the material remain at the same level of radioactivity until criticality where it will suddenly emit large amounts of radiation making my proximity unsafe.

I hope my amateur explanation is clear.

Thank you.

Text: Sorry if the question makes no sense, it should be clear I'm coming from outside of the biological sciences.

I'm coming from the position of finding the minima of functions of many variables. I'm imagining biological systems evolving towards certain traits which may or may not be optimal for different biological functions. To that end, thinking about the difference between a local minimum and a global minimum, I'm imagining it may be possible to evolve towards a trait that is *good* at the function it performs, but isn't *the best* at it - i.e. there are more optimal configurations for the same task. However, since the trait is still locally optimized, it may take many generations (or some amount of disruption) to evolve away from, since selection pressure will push deviations from the trait back towards the local minimum.

I don't know if any of this makes sense, but I'm just curious if there are any known suboptimal traits like this.

Text: I went on a visit to my local submarine museum this weekend, and had the opportunity to hear a talk by an ex submariner. One of the things he talked about was the red light in the control room. Part of the reason he gave for red lights was to do with night vision, which is well discussed elsewhere. 

But he gave a second reason, which was that when the periscope was up white light would travel up the periscope, alerting others to your presence.  Red light apparently &quot;lacks the power to travel up the periscope&quot;, and so you don't turn your submarine into a lighthouse. 

Is this true? And if so what's the physics behind it?

Eta: to be clear, I understand the night vision part. I only mention it to try and clarify that it wasn't the question, but apparently I failed. The question is specifically about the light travelling up the periscope, and given that red light travels better than other colours in air if this is true there's something more subtle than just an energy dependence going on.

Text: A beekeeper once told me that wasps kill so many bees they reduce polination, and it would be beneficial to drastically reduce the wasp population.

However, I've read that wasps are important polinators themselves, which makes me think we shouldn't really try to wipe them out.

So with these two opposite views: do wasps have a positive or negative overall effect on polination in the world?

Text: I realize that the image of a dead T-Rex being liquefied by pressure and heat and then getting pumped into the tank of our car millions of years later is bullshit. I know fossil fuel is basically phytoplankton.

But what are the chances of bigger life forms being sedimented alongside the plankton? Would fish/aquatic dinosaurs even turn into oil if the conditions were right? I assume the latter are made up of more protein and less carbohydrate compared to plankton.

Are there any reasonable estimates how much oil is not from plankton? I would expect values well below 1 %, but feels like at least *some* of fossil fuel molecules could be from dinosaurs.

Text: We are researchers from the Allen Institute, UW Medicine, and Kaiser Permanente, and have genetically profiled and mapped key regions of the brains of individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease to uncover cell types, genetic patterns, and other biomarkers affected by this debilitating neurological disorder affecting millions across the world.

Early findings have revealed cell populations that are preferentially affected by Alzheimer's - both increasing and decreasing in number - and other physiological changes that could point to new targets for treatments in the future.

This massive, collaborative undertaking, the [Seattle Alzheimer's Disease Brain Cell Atlas](http://portal.brain-map.org/explore/seattle-alzheimers-disease) (SEA-AD), has resulted in a high-resolution, high-quality, publicly accessible atlas of aging and Alzheimer's disease. The massive data set represents detailed analysis of over 1.2 million brain cells from 84 patients. The data is openly available to other researchers in the hopes of catalyzing further research and improving our understanding of the complex and likely heterogenous nature of Alzheimer's.

We are:

+ **Jeremy Miller (Ph.D.) - Senior Scientist, Allen Institute**: Dr. Miller joined the Allen Institute in 2011 to help with computational data analysis of the Allen Human Brain Atlas project. He is first author on several major manuscripts describing the Allen Institute's large-scale transcriptomic resources on the adult and developing human and non-human primate brain, including the Aging, Dementia, and Traumatic Brain Injury Study. Miller received his Ph.D. in neuroscience from UCLA, where he studied gene expression changes in the brain in Alzheimer's disease and normal aging in the lab of Dr. Daniel Geschwind.
+ **Kyle Travaglini (Ph.D.) - Scientist I, Allen Institute**: Kyle Travaglini is a Scientist at the Allen Institute for Brain Science. As a member of the Human Cell Types program, Kyle is focused on characterizing the molecular and cellular changes that underpin Alzheimer's disease. Previously, he completed a Ph.D. in Biochemistry at Stanford University, where he constructed a single cell transcriptomic atlas of the human lung under the mentorship of Dr. Mark Krasnow. Prior to that, he conducted research with Dr. Steven Clark at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he received a B.S. in Biochemistry and identified a mechanism in yeast that helps ensure their proteins are built correctly.
+ **Shubhabrata &quot;Joey&quot; Mukherjee (Ph.D., MS) - Assistant Professor, UW Department of Medicine**: Dr. Shubhabrata is trained in statistics, psychometrics, and genetics related to Alzheimer's disease research. He is an active member of the AD Genetics Consortium (ADGC) and the International Genomics of Alzheimer's project (IGAP).
+ **Jeanelle Ariza Torres - Research Scientists**: Jeanelle Ariza Torres, is a Research Scientist at the UW Medicine Biorepository and Integrated Research (BRaIN) laboratory at the University of Washington. She is the leader for the neuropathology quantification efforts using the whole slide image analysis in FFPE analysis and Luminex from human brain tissue extractions.
+ **Eitan S. Kaplan - Ph.D. Scientific Project and Alliance Manager**:
Eitan S. Kaplan joined the Allen Institute in 2020 and serves as the Scientific Project and Alliance Manager for the multi-site Human Alzheimer’s Disease Collaborative Research Center. The Human AD Center aims to build high-resolution maps of Alzheimer’s patients’ brains and thereby generate a detailed understanding of the core molecular and cellular phenotype of Alzheimer’s disease at the level of cell types and molecular pathways. The center seeks to pinpoint how and where the progressive disorder starts, and ultimately, to find new targets for therapy. Eitan previously worked at Seattle Children's Research Institute as a Scientific Project Manager in Business Operations, and as a neuroscience researcher in the Center for Integrative Brain Research studying gene-environment interaction in neuro-developmental disorders. Eitan earned his doctorate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology investigating the mechanisms underlying experience-dependent synaptic plasticity in the cerebral cortex. Eitan completed his bachelor’s degree in Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior at the University of California, Davis.

Text: To better explain and be more specific...
We have an ice cream food truck. We are trying to mitigate damage in case our storage freezer breaks or loses power.

We have some really &quot;high tech&quot; freezer packs that we're going to put into the freezer, so if the power goes out, the freezer packs keep the temperature as close to 0° as possible.

I would like to run a test to see just how long they'll maintain the temperature (we may be able to transport the cooler to events without having to run a generator). 

But, I don't want to run the test with the ice cream in the freezer (don't want to risk ruining it).

So my question: Does it take more energy to maintain temperature if the freezer is full of ice cream, or more if it's empty? (Fit that matter, maybe it's the same?).

 If I can know this answer, then I can think &quot;ok, so it maintained 0° for X hours empty, and since it will use less/more energy when full, then I can expect +/-X hours when it's full. &quot;

Extra bonus if there's some sort of formula that says &quot;with X amount of mass inside, you can expect +/-X% of time before the temperature exceeds 0°&quot;

I can't seem to wrap my head around it... Part of me says that more ice cream will &quot;absorb&quot; more heat and require more energy to keep them cold. The other part of me thinks maybe the extra mass of ice cream inside will help keep it cold.

For instance, if we’re talking with a friend in a public space, how does our brain know which sounds to filter out (other people talking in the vicinity) and which sounds not to filter out (sound of a friend’s voice). Is this mechanism simply the brain performing Fourier Transforms instantaneously or is it simply a biological mechanism?

Tonight I saw someone pee outside - turned away of course while they went - and they left a puddle. Maybe an hour after, a rat came by and sat right in the puddle for a few seconds before scurrying off again.

Curious how long virus (COVID or anything else) stays active in urine once it hits the air.

Thanks in advance.

Update: a lot of discussion here about whether it's possible to transmit viruses through urine - the answer is yes, it's possible. I'm asking how long it stays active outside of the body, usually on the ground (may be different for different viruses/conditions).

Also, whether we should all be worried about the rat.

See CDC page on CMV for one example: [https://www.cdc.gov/cmv/overview.html](https://www.cdc.gov/cmv/overview.html)

Thanks and sorry if this is a silly question, I am just curious and was wondering for a while

I have a few questions about this virus because these news articles don't make it too clear:

1. The reported 35 infections: Is that the total number of infections since 2018 or is that the current ongoing infections?
2. If not current, why break this news now and make a big deal of it? And how many are currently infected?
3. Articles say human to human transmission hasn't been identified. How did 35 people presumably get the same virus?
4. Is this virus or it's family of viruses known to be highly transmissible and respiratory like Covid?
5. WHO has Henipaviruses classified as Level 4 Biosafety risk with high pandemic potential. What does that mean in the context of this virus?

Text: I've recently gotten myself very confused about certain ways that circuits work at a massive scale, partially due to [Veritasium](https://youtu.be/bHIhgxav9LY)/AlphaPhoneix's recent videos on the subject. Basically, isn't it true that electrons move through the ground/earth/crust over very long time spans? And is that movement necessary to make our power grid function? I think I understand that in AC power lines, electrons are just moving back and forth a tiny distance. But that's not the case for DC, right?

Suppose a giant solar farm in North Africa, with massive high voltage DC undersea cables sending the power into Europe. This is already a reality, but for sake of argument suppose the power is arbitrarily large, runs 24/7, is always flowing one way, and the experiment continues for an arbitrary length of time. Isn't it the case that an electron that began in the wires in north Africa could, and in fact certainly would, move all the way through the wire to Europe, end up in the ground/earth in Europe, and by the massive &quot;pressure&quot; differential, eventually drift all the way through the ground and end up back in the wire in north Africa?

I think the answer here is that this is correct in its most basic inception, but that there are way too many electrons to talk about it this way. But what if the earth was arbitrarily small, or the cable running from one side of the earth to the other? Suppose a tidally locked planet, with the sun side completely covered in solar panels, sending the power to the dark side. The planet would become a capacitor, with the dark side negatively charged. Surely there is some situation where this would cause actual engineering issues, and need return wires or something.

I hope this made sense and you can help clear up my understanding, this question has been bothering me for years!

Text: If you've ever watched the shoreline on a big body of water, especially where people are surfing for example, you've seen what I'm talking about. The ocean surface will be relatively calm with smaller waves coming in, and then all of a sudden, a handful of larger waves come, then the ocean calms down again for a period of time. These groups of waves are often called &quot;sets&quot; or I've also read &quot;wave trains&quot;.

I understand how and why ocean waves form, how different frequencies emerge from storms and how the shorter period ones die out as the larger/longer ones eventually can move across entire oceans with relatively little loss in energy. I have a decent understanding of certain types of waves and their dynamics as I studied engineering in school, and have also been an avid surfer for twenty years.

However, I've searched online numerous times for an explanation as to **WHY** or **HOW** ocean waves group into sets, rather than simply remaining as a uniform train of similar waves, and nobody seems to ever explain the mechanisms behind it. They simply mention that it happens, and move on.

An astrophysicist friend once explained acoustic resonance to me as his guess to a possible reason, which seemed to have something to it, but I truly have no idea. My latest search's top result yielded &quot;large period waves combine with local short period waves to form these groups&quot; which is complete BS.

Thank you very much!

Text: I was thinking about this and I am quite curious if something like Olympus Mons could form here. (Not really an exact replica, but somewhat similar with some changes.)

The characteristics I am thinking about is pretty much a stationary plate, a powerful hotspot (similar to the Hawaiian hotspot) and a stable crust (a thick craton) for such a volcano (more like a really high plateau) to stand on with minimal sinkage.

The conditions met would not really exist on Earth at some time or another, but the closest thing to that, in my opinion, is the Tibesti mountains in Africa, where a hotspot underneath the Saharan Meta-craton produced a few volcanoes.

Could it exist in some form and, if so, what process would lead to that and how would it form?

Text: Let's make a few presumptions:

Black holes are remnants of massive stars.

The Eddington limit states that a star can only reach a few hundred solar masses at max. A &quot;newborn&quot; black hole would only have a few hundred solar masses at max.

So the only way for supermassive black holes to reach their size would be to consume other bodies. However, due to time dilation, masses approaching the event horizon of any black hole would freeze in time to our perspective, thus making it impossible for any black hole to gain mass.

And even if that is not a problem, most objects approaching a black hole would be slingshotted away simply because space is huge and a black hole is relatively tiny.

How does it work IRL? In which part am I wrong?

It's already known to be non-linear because temporal age and developmental age aren't linearly transferable across species, but it makes me wonder if dogs actually have higher lifespan variance than humans or if it's just an incomplete model.

Text: We’re taught that T cells require 2 signals for activation (engagement with an antigen-MHC complex and engagement of co-stimulatory molecules that are only expressed in the presence of inflammatory cytokines). When you have signal 1 without signal 2, these peripheral T cells supposedly undergo peripheral deletion or anergy. 

However, during an infection, you do have inflammatory cytokines present, so theoretically self-reactive T cells would receive both signal 1 and 2 and therefore activate. Do anergy and deletion just not occur during an infection? I am assuming there some another mechanism that addresses this but I haven’t been able to find an answer.

Does the 25 grams essentially block less B1 receptors (absolute number) than the 100 grams. Does the 100 grams block 4x the number of B1 receptors or simply just lasts 4x as long?

Meanwhile lots of people are getting sick and if it progresses to something worse it is defined by what it caused, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. 

I find it odd at any university in the US a dozen students in each class are out sick then the next week or two another dozen. Each absence is costly, yet even at Universities when the students go to the doctors on campus they make no attempt to study “what is this illness” and whether warning classes about what is spreading or attempt to isolate it or stop it.

Text: Say there's a cloud of plasma floating in space, and there's a uniform magnetic field around/permeating it. If there is also an electric field present, the plasma will move in the direction of E x B, from what I understand.

Now say there is a beam of laser light shooting through the plasma. Light is made of photons, which are electromagnetic oscillations.

So how does a photon end up affecting the plasma?

One option I could see is that the electric field from the laser and the background magnetic field means the plasma moves in the E_laser x B_background direction.

Another option is that it moves in the E_laser x B_laser direction.

Another option is that it doesn't move but oscillates back and forth along one of those directions, because light is oscillating.

Another option is that it moves in the direction the light was going, because light has momentum and its pushing the plasma. Which is just the 2nd option, but with a different reason.

Another option is that it doesn't move at all and I don't understand photons.

Text: Is there a physical visualization that can help reinforce this? I'm not seeing the relationship between the wavelength and physical object size.

The wavelength of light is continuous, and describes the E/M vector at a point. So if we have an atom at some position X, and we shoot an infinitely thin beam of visible light (wavelength larger than atom's size), the light must travel and hit the atom at position X because the light is continuous. It's not like the lightwave just skips over position X. So the atom should interact with the visible light, somehow. If it were to reflect the visible light back to us, then why can't we see the atom?

Text: (This is probably more of an applied math question, but I don't think Miller indices are used in any context besides crystal structure, and crystal structure is part of physics and chemistry (I'm specifically learning about the topic in an EE course on the physics of semiconductors), so it seemed more appropriate to ask it in the science sub than the math one.)

So just, _why_ the reciprocal?  Like, I can see how we can form a valid coordinate system that way, but it seems like just an unnecessary complication, when we could just use the actual axis intersection points. 

I've been Googling, trying to find an explanation (as my textbook gave no actual explanation of the theory, just a single example of how get the indices) and Wikipedia is the only source I've found so far that even attempts to explain the actual theory. It says that Miller indices &quot;denote the family of (parallel) lattice planes... orthogonal to... the basis or primitive translation vectors of the reciprocal lattice for the given Bravais lattice.&quot;  I mostly understand what that's saying, but I have some questions: first, if we want to represent planes orthogonal to the basis vectors, shouldn't we be taking the _negative_ reciprocals?  Second, why do we want the planes to be perpendicular to the basis vectors in the first place?  And third, why are we working with &quot;the basis or primitive translation vectors of the _reciprocal lattice_&quot; at all?  

I get why we want to &quot;reduce&quot; (not sure if that's the correct terminology) more complicated crystal structures to the 14 Bravais structures, and we studied all those structures pretty in depth when I took chem 102 last year, so I'm pretty comfortable with them.  And I'm solid on basic linear algebra, so I get that going to the Bravais form is really just a change of basis.  What I don't get is why we're working with a basis for the &quot;reciprocal space&quot;.  I looked at the Wikipedia article on that subject and it mentioned that the reciprocal lattice is the Fourier transform of the original lattice -- and alright, I've work with Fourier transforms and similar integral transforms before and I know it can sometimes be simpler to do an integral transform, perform the relevant computation, than get the inverse transform from a table (or a CAS, such as Wolfram Alpha).  But how the heck does just taking the reciprocal correspond to the Fourier transform?  And why would we even _want_ to Fourier transform in this context?

Text: The angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence when light is reflected from a smooth surface. 

What is the mechanism of this function? When light hits the surface, the energy of the photons are absorbed by the atoms that comprise the surface material. Then the atoms emit that energy as 'reflected' photons. Why do the atoms emit that energy in a particular direction, along a path defined by the angle of incidence? 

To my understanding, photonic energy has been absorbed in the form of electrons being excited to a higher energy level; then, the electrons return to their original energy level by emitting an equivalently energetic photon. At the atomic level, how does the direction of the incoming energy have an impact on direction in which the subsequent emission occurs?

These genes are recessive or dominant, so one is more likely to be switched on than the other. So when we don't pass along a gene to the next generation, say I have a genetic condition but my child doesn't carry that same gene, how does that not get passed along? Is that the 'other half' of the 50% that it got from me? If so, how does the child have two copies of every gene? Can two copies come from one parent? Please feel free to correct me if I have misunderstood something.... cheers!

Rather, it seems like the bulk of vCJD cases were in the UK in the 90s from eating normal muscle meat. Of course I’m certainly happy that it is extremely rare (hopefully to the point of extinction).

It sounds bad, but it's also from a study that may not be peer reviewed (I can't seem to find methodology, authors, or even the text of the study) by a group I've never heard of and seems focused on activism.

Is there any way to verify if this study is real? And if it's real, is it scientifically sound?

Text: So I just saw a picture of the hands of a person with vitiligo, and they had the same pattern on both hands of remaining vs lost pigment - a very similarly shaped pattern on the front of each hand, including an almost (but not quite) identical patch of missing pigment within the pigmented area, and each ring finger had a similar loop of remaining pigment near the knuckle joint, swooping upwards on the inner side, towards the next joint. 


It made me wonder, what determines where pigment is lost? It often seems to be not exactly symmetrical, but similar enough on either side of the body that I have to assume  that it’s not random. 


Like, thinking of Winnie Harlow, her pigment loss around her mouth is roughly the same on the right and the left, such that it almost looks like a consistent shape around her mouth. 


Can anyone please explain? I tried Googling it, but no luck. 


Thanks!

But in other cases, it is argued that the carbon dioxide will drop down (as in fire suppression systems), or hot air will rise etc based on differing densities.

Is it all about mixing - or are there other effects at play?

I've never forgotten this idea - it sounds plausible but as I've never heard the claim elsewhere I suspect it is wrong. Is there any basis for this?

If it is true, then what's the most massive a black hole could be to pass through the Earth without causing a commotion?

Text: Yes, I'm aware that there have been semi-recent breakthroughs to suggest that the T-Rex had lips that covered its teeth. I'd like to take that one step further by postulating that the T-Rex had gums that fully concealed its teeth.

One thing that made me think about this was that I remembered hearing that the T-Rex likely had a pseudo-venom from the bacteria in its mouth, just like the Komodo dragon. Some sources I found state that the Komodo dragon's mouth bacteria can in large part be attributed to meat and guts that build up in its thick gums.

On the other hand, the Komodo dragon eats its prey whole, while the T-Rex (I presume) tore large chunks at a time, like a crocodile does. 

Anyway, I haven't found any sources that may hint toward the Komodo theory, only ones that reinforce the whole lip thing. Does anyone know if there's any merit to this? Why or why would it not be possible?

I did google searched and searched this sub for an answer. The closest I got was the link at the bottom.

I understand that many animals have sperm with short life cycles. I also understand that women are able to keep their same oocyte their whole life's. However eggs are living cells that are still attached to the host body and are being fed/wasted carried away from. Is this the same action that happens inside a queens body's when they store sperm for up to 25 years? Or is there a different mechanism of action?

If you have info related to other animals besides queen ants I'd be interested in hearing it as well.

If this is the case (please let me know if my assumptions are wrong), why does it seem like hybrid power trains of cars and boats have their combustion engines linked to the power train through a drive shaft rather than just producing more electricity to drive the electric motors? I get the sometimes they might be doing this to get more power and avoid having to install more powerful electric motors to accept the power from the generator rather than just the batteries, but it seems just having more range would a huge advantage. Is there something I'm missing?

Text: I don't know too much about shit like this, so maybe I am misunderstanding something, but I don't understand how we can refer to events that happened in the universe with precise timestamps. From my understanding (very limited), time passes different in different places due to gravitational time dilation. As an example, in Interstellar, the water planet's time passed significantly slower.

Essentially, the core of my question is: wouldn't the time since the creation of the universe be different depending on how time passes in the area of the universe you are? Like if a planet experienced similar time dilation to the one in Interstellar, wouldn't the age of the universe be lower? Is the age of the universe (13.7b years), just the age of someone experiencing the level of time dilation we do? I understand that time is a human concept used to explain how things progress, so I might be just confused.

Anyways, can anyone help me out? I have not read very much into this so the answer is prolly easy but idk. Thanks

Text: Cactaceae are the only family I know of where almost any species can be successfully grafted to almost any other species. Almost every cactus is capable of producing fertile, hybrids within its genus. Beyond that, it's been found that many cacti are even capable of intergeneric hybridization. Desert cacti are supposed to have diverged and evolved during a worldwide drying event roughly 10-25 mya (I'm assuming the rainforest/vining species evolved at a similar time) This is relatively recent on the scale of plant evolution, is this why they're able to graft and breed so freely? They haven't had enough time to diverge to the point of incompatibility?

Right now I’m reading the immortal life of Henrietta lacks and in the book, it talks about how many samples of cervical cancer were taken from different women and tested but only Henrietta’s cells continued to grow and divide. Why was it that only Henriettas cells continued to divide even though most cells have the enzyme telomeres activated?

Text: I was looking at some of the pictures taken by the JWTS and it occurred to me that because the universe has grown in size since the light was emitted from the earliest galaxies, wouldn't the angular size of the oldest galaxies should be larger than galaxies in the foreground from our perspective? I'm thinking about it sorta like if you half inflate a balloon, draw an image on it, and then continue to blow it up, the image would appear stretched and larger.  


My guess; between when the universe first became visible and now, the universe hasn't expanded much and that older galaxies are larger than they appear, but not by much.

Text: We all know that using a lithium ion battery causes it's capacity to decrease over the years. But I am interested in better understanding how different usage patterns impact the speed of this degradation. I've read some about the chemical mechanisms that cause this problem, and I've read several articles on &quot;best practices&quot; for battery health, but I still do not feel like I have a good understanding of everything.

For example, suppose we need to use 20% of the energy of a battery. Is it best for the long term health to only charge the battery up to 20%, and then drain it to 0%, and then back to 20%? Or is it better to go from 100%-80%-100%? Or is the optimal thing to split the middle and go from 60%-40%-60%?

I have also seen it mentioned that charging batteries more slowly improves their lifespan. Is this solely because of reduced heat, or is that still true even if temperature is removed from the equation? I have also seen many mentions of &quot;deep cycles&quot; being bad for the battery, meaning that multiple smaller discharges/recharges in a row are better than a longer discharge. Does this mean that, in the previous example, using the battery from 100%-80%-100% every day is worse for long term battery health than doing four sets of 100%-95%-100% every day?

While I would certainly appreciate any well-informed answer to the above questions, what I am ultimately searching for is a better understanding of the subject that would allow me to answer such questions myself.

As a layperson this strikes me as strange because it seems like a radio telescope would be significantly easier to build and launch than an optical telescope. 

A few possible guesses come to mind based on my small amount of astronomy knowledge:

Fewer advantages over land-based observation, relative to an optical scope?

Interferometry using huge numbers of smaller ground based dishes simply more useful?

Some engineering challenge I'm not considering?

Text: Good morning askscience guys, I have a question that I've been thinking about for years.  To the point, physiologically the human being has mechanisms to regulate acid-base control, and among them is pulmonary ventilation, in case the blood turns to a more acidic pH, the body generates hyperventilation to regulate the pH.  Otherwise, hyperventilation produces alkalosis.  So here is my question, dogs in hot weather or extreme exercise hyperventilate and do so a lot.  How is it that dogs regulate blood pH quickly without suffering alkalosis when they start hyperventilating?  I appreciate your response in advance, thank you very much.

A) For example, fast-growing is probably one of the most sought features, did we achieve it? (in general, not for every species of tree). If so, is it a « stable » feature, ie. can buy gmo seeds which claim to grow fast, and it actually will?

 B) What other common features can we do? I guess we researched bugs resistance, trunk strength, etc. More specifically, I can also think of seedless grapes

C) More specifically, I was thinking about a feature : endless/long growing branches? I suppose that a normal tree regulates its branches to match with the trunk (otherwise a thin trunk would not be able to support an absurd weight of overgrown branches), also our industries have probably little interest in such a feature.. but still I wonder, can we GM a tree to do that (and handle the consequences of too long branches) ?

Text: I sometimes have cramps from exercising and I have these questions about them. How does sodium deficiency cause cramps? Sodium initiates muscle contraction, so shouldn't a sodium deficiency cause flaccidity? Also what makes cramps so painful? We contract muscles all the time, so why does this particular contraction have you rolling over in pain and why so much pain? What makes muscles like the calf and toe muscles more prone to cramping than the thorax muscles or muscles of the arm?

Also how much water would it take to “put out” the sun?

Text: If you've got minus lenses lying around you can repeat this experiment with any Camera you have with you.

If you put a minus lens in front of camera lens and focus the camera at a very distant object (~infinity), you'll see that the camera will report the actual focus distance as somewhere in the ballpark of 1/(Power of the minus lens in metres).
Even though the object at infinity will be in apparently sharp focus in the viewfinder, the indicator will still show the camera focused at a close distance stated above.

To answer this, you need to understand how Minus lenses work:
Minus lenses form the virtual image of objects at infinity at their focus - this is what the camera is seeing.

Now what happens, if you want to focus your camera from very far to somewhere near while still 'wearing' minus lenses?
Well, you'll see that the indicated actual focusing distance in your Camera gets even closer than the previously observed distance.

You can verify that the apparent distance of the object and the actual focusing distance of lens optics obeys this formula:
Actual focusing distance = 100 / (100/Apparent distance - signed power of lens kept in front of the camera)

For example, focusing your camera at an object at 50cm while putting minus lenses of glasses of -2 will result in actual focusing distance equal to
100 / (100/50 - (-2)) = ~25cm

This is exactly what I observed with my Fujifilm X-S10.

Now the actual question is this?
Eyes also operate in a manner similar yo to a Camera with lens, aperture etc.

Can I draw similar result for the eyes also??
Specifically is it true based on above results that a Myope's eyes who's wearing -4 glasses viewing an object at 25cm are actually focused at 12.5cm?? And is that the cause of Myopia progression??

My question is if a planet IS tidally locked, how much of the surface could support life?  Is there a very small sliver of land that humans could live on, or is it in fact quite thick?  Do we know by how much the temperature would increase as you walked round the planet?  

I'm asking as it's very difficult to conceptualise a tidally locked planet give we live on one that is spinning!  I presume for example the Sun would be un-moving in the Sky from any one point.

So I’m flairing this as physics, but it could be that they misinterpreted my original question which is kinda complicated. So is it true? And why?

Text: I was reading the results of a family member's recent genetic test and there are an astounding number of genotype-disease links that they check for. I was wondering if there is some sort of standard of evidence that each of these links has to meet before they are taken seriously and tested for or if there is really no standard and that direct-to-consumer genetics companies (like 23andMe) just offer tests for any possible disease even if the evidence is questionable.

Are all of these links established the same way? I imagine one way would be to trace the biochemical pathway from certain DNA sequence all the way to the proteins they produce and see if the the resulting proteome would result in disease (for example, I think [this is possible](https://sickle-cell.com/causes#:~:text=figure%201%3A%20hemoglobin%20s%20(hbs)%20genetic%20and%20phenotypic%20mutations) for sickle cell anemia). But I imagine the other, (and less reliable?) way would be to look at people with diseases, look at their genomes, and the form statistical correlations, ie. &quot;most people with this disease have this genetic variant, so we will assume this genetic variant and this disease are linked&quot;.

Text: If we take dogs for example.  How much of the typical variation between breeds is epigenetic vs genetic?

And regarding the breeding process - is there some kind of rolling tradeoff where genetic changes accumulate?  By that I mean if you arbitrarily quantified divergence, say 10 units / generation.   Maybe at after 40 units divergence it's 20/20 epigenetic/genetic, but then at 100 units it's 30/70 epigenetic/genetic.

My interest in this stems from fish that live in high-sulfur streams.  There are very few examples but cutting edge work found that many of the adaptions were epigenetic.

So for example in violinists the part of the brain associated with fine motor control is larger, or in taxi drivers that for spacial memory. (Or so I heard)

Given that there is finite space in the brain, do other now less used areas grow smaller?

And what does this mean in practical terms for the acquisition of skills? Is there a practical limit to how much a brain can &quot;learn&quot; without unlearning things, or is how much time one can invest into developing and maintaining skills the only limiting factor?

Text: I’m talking about elements like Copper and Ruthenium. Following the Aufbau principle, you expect the 4s orbital to be filled before the 3d orbital. However, Cu has the configuration [Ar] 4s1 3d10 instead of [Ar] 4s2 3d9. I can somewhat understand that a full d-orbital can somehow be preferred, since the total spin stays the same (first rule of Hund), even though the second rule of Hund is not followed. But where I am completely lost is with elements like ruthenium ([Kr] 5s1 4d7), where Hunds rules are completely ignored and the removed second 5s electron doesn’t contribute to a fully filled d-orbital. 

I want to understand why this is the case. I get that they’re somehow lower in energy, but I want to understand why. My search in old studybooks and internet did not help, even my old university prof doesn’t know.

So my question is: how is it that some elements have unexpected electron configurations, and why?

EDIT: copper instead of chromium

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for 'X' were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;.

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed.

They wouldn't personally benefit from that, but their 20-30x great grand children might, which might have some &quot;plant more nuts&quot; genes. Seems remote that there would be enough selection pressure for this specific example, but I was wondering if there are any known examples like this of evolution pressure that acts not on the individual, but later generations.

Text: I was at my local rec center pool and had this thought.

Let's say you have a donut-shaped pool with jets that keep the water moving clockwise with negligible turbulence and a spherical object floating in that pool. Without bumping into the sides, would the ball begin spinning relative to the ground or stay facing relatively the same direction? 

Thinking about the forces involved, my intuition tells me that the force of the water acting on the ball should always be tangential to the donut. Also, would the stream of water keep the ball in the center, or would it be flung to the outside perimeter of the pool? How would the situation change if it were a neutrally buoyant sphere in a cylindrical pipe?

Text: Something I thought about. Oxygen has a valence of 6, while hydrogen has a valence of 1. In the firm of H6O
Can each hydrogen atom take an election and therefore be bonded?
Assuming it can exist, I presume the likelihood is that it would degrade into water and hydrogen gas. Is that right? Why?

What shape would it take on if it can exist? Disc? Cubic? There doesn't seem to be any info on whether type molecule exists.
Thanks in advance!!

Text: I saw an article by researchers from the Max-Planck-Institute about brain structure and connectivity changes associated with pornography consumption recently and found it had rather drastic seeming implications for the caudate in that consuming porn could be responsible for just shrinking its gray matter ([https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1874574](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1874574)). 

Now, having been in that age, and made use of the stimulation from that type of media rather often (in the past, of course), this seems kind of relevant and concerning for me. So I've come here to ask: 

Does gray matter in general or at least in specific regions of the brain including the caudate regenerate after it's shrunk through the kind of effects porn consumption appears to have on it or is it most likely just going to be lost for good because of it?

* What process is happening at a molecular level?
* Why are the separations thermodynamically favorable?
* What maintains the boundaries between charged regions (i.e. why is there not just a softer gradient)?
* Why does the cumulonimbus preferentially get a negative charge, and what really differentiates the process for positive lightning?

I am wondering to what extent climate models take into account chaos math, and if we are even going to be able to predict the impacts of global warming with any reasonable accuracy.  I mean, we are definitely going to seriously screw up our planet and possibly wipe ourselves out, but do we have any reasonable idea /how/?

+ Large-Scale Structure: Matter in the Universe forms a &quot;cosmic web&quot; with clusters, filaments and voids. The positions of galaxies in the sky shows imprints of the physics in the early universe
+ Dark Matter: Most matter in the universe seems to be &quot;Dark Matter&quot;, i.e. not noticeable through any means except for its effect on light and other matter via gravity
+ Dark Energy: The unknown force causing the universe's expansion to accelerate today

This made me wonder if people with aphantasia experience things like depression at all, in lower numbers, or if they simply experience it differently. Surely if you have no voice in your head to telling you you're worthless then you must be free from the negative feelings it causes. I would also think the the same would apply to various other mental disorders.  
Is there any correlation between having aphantasia (or not) and susceptibility to mental illness?

Text: I've always heard that pregnancy over ages 35 (often called  Advanced Maternal Age) is significantly more dangerous for both the woman and the baby, due to the higher risks of miscarriages, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes and decrease in fertility rates (as said [here](https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/geriatric-pregnancy), [here](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317861) and [here](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22438-advanced-maternal-age), for example). But, I watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9ryP0UyO5U), from &quot;Adam Ruins Everything&quot;, which provides evidence that the risks of getting pregnant between the ages of 35 and 40 don't increase as much as warned by the majority of doctors.

So, what's the truth about pregnancy after 35? If women could have babies until they were 40 without taking any more risks, it would be better to their careers.

It's odd to me that the body will suddenly just go into teeth producing mode when it wants and it's generally the same for everyone in terms of what ages it does this. How do adult teeth form? Is it new bone that the body just randomly grows? What would stop us from in a way triggering these genes or signals to the body to start to grow more new teeth later in life?

Text: Not sure if I worded the title correctly, but I was wondering how antibodies and resistance to Covid works. Take, for instance, my experience with the virus…

* I was vaccinated in August 2021.
* I was infected by Covid-19 in October 2021. No hospital visit or monoclonal treatment required.
* Antibodies are said to be good for 90 days. 
* I chose not to get any boosters. 
* I have not been as “safe” as one could be, and have been in largely unmasked crowds on occasion. I have been to stores, out with friends, on vacation, etc. — always following Covid guidelines, but when given the option not to mask up, I have chosen not to. 
* Luckily, to my knowledge, I have not been infected by Covid-19 a second time. 

If your body produces antibodies after infection, is it possible that continued exposure to Covid would ensure your body continues to produce antibodies?

Why would continual exposure to Covid *not* act similarly to a booster?

Text: Wildfires in many regions are becoming more frequent and more severe. Most of the headlines focus on the short and long-term impacts these disasters have on plants, animals and the economy. But what's going on underground? Research is just beginning to demonstrate the impacts disturbances to microbial communities can have on soil composition, plant behavior and human health.

Join us today at 2 PM ET (19UT) for an AMA, organized by the American Society for Microbiology, focused on the impact wildfires are having on microbial communities. We will take questions about experimental approaches being taken to study this issue, share insight into how the increased frequency and severity of fires is affecting ecosystems at the micro and macro levels, and discuss strategies for managing fire-affected ecosystems under changing fire regimes.
Ask us anything!

Text: Ive been doing a lot of research in regards to this but can't seem to get or even understand the mechanism.

According to Davies et al.:&lt;&lt; *The npr-1 signaling pathway may act by presynaptic inhibition and could therefore alter transmitter release at the same sites as the SLO-1 channel. Mutations in the slo-1 gene, which confer considerably more (up to 2.5 times) ethanol resistance than null alleles of npr-1, have serious phenotypic consequences that would be likely to compromise fitness of animals carrying them. In contrast, allelic variation in genes like npr-1 may have more subtle alterations in transmitter release, and therefore may be more easily maintained in wild populations. Such allelic variation may have major phenotypic consequences when animals are exposed to ethanol*. &gt;&gt;

If so, then.... here's what I don't quite get. Why did the scientists/statisticians package the information based on the 5-year timeline? I'm not quite sure what is so significant about the &quot;5-year&quot; part. Hmm why didn't they tell us about the survival rate in the first 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, etc. years instead? Is it perhaps because the '50%' statistic is a catchy/sexy number? I don't think it is catchy at all, because I don't see it as being objectively more significant than 40%, 60%, or any other percent for that matter.

Please someone, help me understand the importance of such statements if they are in fact important. I fail to see anything important about them at all.

Text: To my understanding the energy that goes into an appliance plugged into your wall is lost in the form of heat and light (which eventually bounces around your room enough times to also become heat).

Does this mean that any appliance that produces heat as a byproduct is equally efficient as an electric space heater?

Does this mean running a PC in a thermostat heated room is essentially free, on account of the heat from the PC meaning the space heater has to run less?

If this isn't the case, then where does the excess energy from the appliance go, if not into the room the appliance is in?

This dumb question brought to you by, me fussing about energy bills this winter! Also a bit of natural curiosity since no answer feels obvious in an intuitive sense to me.

Text: I was taught that mountain ranges create dryer environments on the side facing away from the prevailing winds and wetter environments on the side facing towards it. In most cases, this holds true. Cascades, Sierra Nevada, Madagascar, NZ South Island, etc. The Andes is an almost perfect example of this because the locations of the dryer and wetter environments switch as the prevailing winds change wrt latitude.

However, there seems to be some cases in which the rain shadow seems to be inverted. For example, in southern India, there is the Western Ghats mountain range. The prevailing winds at this latitude blow from northeast to southwest, which would should mean that the eastern side is wetter than the western side of the range. However, it's the opposite that's true. The western side of this mountain range is wetter than the eastern side. This is hardly the only example of this, you see this same sort of thing if you look at western Mexico or Turkey's Black Sea coast. 

Why does the rain shadow seem to be on the wrong side in some situations?

Text: Genetic testing for Tay-Sachs begin in the 70s.

Since then [the incidence of Tay-Sachs has fallen by more than 90 percent among Jews, thanks to a combination of scientific advances and volunteer community activism that brought screening for the disease into synagogues, Jewish community centers and, eventually, routine medical care.](https://www.timesofisrael.com/how-jewish-activism-has-wiped-out-tay-sachs/#:~:text=Since%20the%20'70s%2C%20the%20incidence,%2C%20eventually%2C%20routine%20medical%20care.)

[Until 1969, when doctors discovered the enzyme that made testing possible to determine whether parents were carriers of Tay-Sachs, 50 to 60 affected Jewish children were born each year in the United States and Canada. After mass screenings began in 1971, the numbers declined to two to five Jewish births a year, said Karen Zeiger, whose first child died of Tay-Sachs.](https://www.timesofisrael.com/how-jewish-activism-has-wiped-out-tay-sachs/#:~:text=Since%20the%20'70s%2C%20the%20incidence,%2C%20eventually%2C%20routine%20medical%20care.)

[Tay–Sachs disease is a genetic disorder that results in the destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.[1] The most common form is infantile Tay–Sachs disease, which becomes apparent around three to six months of age, with the baby losing the ability to turn over, sit, or crawl.[1] This is then followed by seizures, hearing loss, and inability to move, with death usually occurring by the age of three to five.[3][1] Less commonly, the disease may occur in later childhood or adulthood (juvenile or late-onset).[1] These forms tend to be less severe,[1] but the juvenile form typically results in death by age 15.](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease)

[Tay–Sachs disease is caused by a genetic mutation in the HEXA gene on chromosome 15, which codes for a subunit of the hexosaminidase enzyme known as hexosaminidase A. It is inherited from a person's parents in an autosomal recessive manner.](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease)

[Three main approaches have been used to prevent or reduce the incidence of Tay–Sachs:](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease&amp;section=8)

+ [Prenatal diagnosis. If both parents are identified as carriers, prenatal genetic testing can determine whether the fetus has inherited a defective gene copy from both parents.[30] Chorionic villus sampling (CVS), the most common form of prenatal diagnosis, can be performed between 10 and 14 weeks of gestation. Amniocentesis is usually performed at 15–18 weeks. These procedures have risks of miscarriage of 1% or less.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease&amp;section=8)
+ [Preimplantation genetic diagnosis. By retrieving the mother's eggs for in vitro fertilization, it is possible to test the embryo for the disorder prior to implantation. Healthy embryos are then selected and transferred into the mother's womb, while unhealthy embryos are discarded. In addition to Tay–Sachs disease, preimplantation genetic diagnosis has been used to prevent cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia among other genetic disorders.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease&amp;section=8)
+ [Mate selection. In Orthodox Jewish circles, the organization Dor Yeshorim carries out an anonymous screening program so that carriers for Tay–Sachs and other genetic disorders can avoid marrying each other.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease&amp;section=8)

Each of the mechanisms above would work to eliminate embryos with two Tay-Sachs genes, and preimplantation genetic diagnoses could be used to eliminate embryos with one Tay-Sachs gene, though I have no reason to think it is used that way.

By eliminating embryos with two Tay-Sachs genes, adults (who could reproduce) with Tay-Sachs are also eliminated and so I would think that over time, the genetic frequency of the Tay-Sachs disorder would decline.

Is there any evidence of this for Tay-Sachs?

Has the gene frequency of any recessive genetic disorder been reduced through screening mechanisms?

Text: All other things being equal, adding weight/moving weight lower on the club head is said to increase the launch angle of the ball. But why? Shouldn't it just be the face angle? I read an article that said that the head would pivot during the impact, with the lower center of gravity moving beneath the center of gravity of the ball, thus resulting in a higher launch angle because the face angle changed?

I'm not sure I understand correctly. I watched a slo mo videos of several shots and I couldn't see what they were saying, though it was clear in nearly every case that the ball always left the face on a greater angle than the face itself was pointing.

Is it something to do with spin/roll during the collision? Or something about the offset center of gravities and equal and opposite reactions?

Text:  Hello altogether,

unfortunately I have many different questions about all things fat and protein digestion, specifically regarding animal products with different fat content.

I want to understand the science and the chemistry behind the whole topic and also educate myself even further because it seems like I know nothing.

I tried to do some „research“ and found several different claims, opinions and explanations.

Before I get into the questions, I want to present the claims from the two different „camps“ because obviously there are more schools of thought?!

**Team fatty meat/protein:**

*The more fat that is in the protein the more delayed is digestion and therefore it sits in the small intestine longer and the required enzymes have more time to do their work and help digest the protein and the fat more efficiently, fully and easier! If the protein is leaner it goes to the digestive tract much faster, probably undigested and not fully absorbed by the small intestine.*

*Muscle meats like chicken breast or lean steak can aggravate constipation and therefore its beneficial to replace them with gelatinous meats instead and cuts with more soft tissue like chicken thighs, fatty meats etc. Humans can only use meat fibers properly when they come with fat, collagen and other substances.*

*Dark meat like chicken thighs or fatty cuts of meat contain more nutrients like zinc, iron and more vitamins like b12 additional folate, pantothenic acid, selenium, phosphorous, and vitamins K and A which aids in digestion.*

**Team lean meat/protein:**

*Meats with higher fat content take longer to digest. Also, foods with the least amount of fat, least amount connective tissues, and shorter muscle fibers are easier to digest. It means that fish is the easiest meat to digest, then poultry, pork and lastly beef*

*it also means that if the piece of chicken or turkey you are eating has more fat or long muscle fibers (thighs or drumsticks) than a LEAN piece of steak or a LEAN cut of pork, then that piece of chicken will be harder to digest!*

*A piece of boneless skinless chicken breast is easier to digest than a chicken thigh. Lean ground beef (93/7) is easier to digest than fattier ground beef (80/20) and a lean filet is easier to digest than a ribeye or beef brisket, chick etc.*

Ok, so far so good and I’m confused.

What I found is a study about myoglobin and it seems like that dark meat or cuts of poultry and beef with more myoglobin and more connective tissue are „harder“ to digest than white meat or poultry/beef with less myoglobin!?

**My questions are:**

What sits longer in the stomach, how long and why?

What sits longer in the small intestine, how long and why?

What kind of poultry/meat moves faster through the digestive tract, especially through the small intestine?

Which cuts require more effort, more enzymes, more stomach acid?

Which cuts are more taxing on the liver?

Is it easier and quicker for the small intestine to absorb nutrients from lean or fatty protein and why?

which factor determines whether a piece of animal protein/fat is light or heavy, fast or slow digesting when looking at the fat/food in isolation. Is it the fat content, connective tissue, a combination?

Is a fatty ribeye or hamburger patty (70/30 or 80/20) easier to digest than a lean filet steak? Or a fatty chicken thigh easier than a chicken breast? Pretend that all meats/beef/poultry are cooked to a moist internal temperature, not overcooked, tough or dry

Are low fat dairy products easier and quicker to digest than full fat dairy products?

At the end of the day I want to know which cuts of poultry/meat/beef/fish are easier to digest for the stomach and small intestine and which cuts are moving faster through the digestive tract. Also from which cuts the small intestine can easier absorb nutrients?

Im looking for a evidence based scientific answers in plain English that I can understand what’s going on and why. I don’t need study’s, although it would be nice, but everything backed up with science based explanations and evidence not opinions or preferences like almost everything on YouTube, food blogs etc. I’m looking for people who study this stuff or work in this field and know what they talking about.

Im very thankful for every explanation, help and for everyone who reads this.

I appreciate every Tipp where and how I can educate myself because I don’t want to be lazy.

Thank you very much and have a great day

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/s93rpe/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxvi/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).
* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)
* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)
* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?
* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

\-------------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

`Username: /u/foretopsail`

`General field: Anthropology`

`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`

`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`

`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`

`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

Text: I've heard that telomeres shorten with each cell division, and that this is one of the processes involved in ageing. But for example in humans, a child's cells all are the result of cell division starting from a single cell, which in turn comes from the two gametes of its parents. These gametes are themselves the result of a chain of cell divisions in the parents. So the further you advance in the &quot;generations&quot; axis, the longer these &quot;chains of cell division&quot;. So, how come it's not the case that each generation has shorter telomeres than the one before it?

More generally: a child's cells ultimately come from its parents' cells, and ageing roughly consists of cell damage accumulated over time; so how come the state of ageing isn't transmitted from parent to child, but is instead &quot;reset&quot; every time reproduction happens?

I'm having a hard time writing my thoughts in words, but I hope you understand what I mean.

It's states that MHC receptor  genes are among the most diverse in the human gene pool, so  consequently, there exist many MHC receptors: two people can have two  different types of receptors. Some receptors are better/worse than  others at presenting antigens.

So...is  it safe to say that one reason some people don't get COVID/ have mild  symptoms is because they have MHC receptors that are better at  presenting the antigen? And that those with severe symptoms have  receptors that don't present as well?

Text: I figure that (economic) hard times equal, at least for some populations/groups, lower caloric consumption than usual, which could have some consequences for body size, in particular, height.

In particular if it happens to children or young adults still in the progress of growing, which i figure would be more sensitive to changes in intake(?), and therefore prevent them from reaching their full &quot;potential&quot;. 

Are there any data indicating that, e.g. &quot;population group X experienced economic difficulties in the year Y, which was reflected in a statistically detectable deviation/anomaly in the distribution for height for the group some N years later, compared to how it is normally&quot;

I am just confused how tartaric acid is diprotic since it contains four hydroxides in its molecular structure; does this mean that only two of its hydroxides are reactive?  Maybe it means that after two protons have been donated, the structure changes to where it is no longer able to donate protons?  Any insight is appreciated, thank you.

Dr Rob Thompson did an experiment illustrating it is harder for rainfall to soak into a parched ground this rainfall after a drought can quickly turn into a flash flood.

However, there are some arguing that this experiment is flawed since the cup of water creates a vacuum which is the cause of the longer soak time.

Thoughts ?

Text: I understand how and why ocean waves form, how different frequencies emerge from storms and how the shorter period ones die out as the larger/longer ones eventually can move across entire oceans with relatively little loss in energy. I have a decent understanding of certain types of waves and their dynamics as I studied engineering in school, and have also been an avid surfer for twenty years.

However, I've searched online numerous times for an explanation as to **WHY** or **HOW** ocean waves group into sets, rather than simply remaining as a uniform train of similar waves, and nobody seems to ever explain the mechanisms behind it. They simply mention that it happens, and move on.

An astrophysicist friend once explained acoustic resonance to me as his guess to a possible reason, which seemed to have something to it, but I truly have no idea. My latest search's top result yielded &quot;large period waves combine with local short period waves to form these groups&quot; which is complete BS. I've also seen someone write that wind gusts are responsible, which doesn't seem accurate either.

Does anybody have a way of explaining this phenomenon?

Thank you very much!

Are high solar wind speeds more disruptive than low ones? Or does it have to do with more density? What fluctuations in magnetic field readings indicate unusual sun activity?

How do these things come together in a forecast? Is it easy to use that data to understand space weather, or do you need to process it heavily to forecast?

In my head I'm thinking of cities in North America on the east coast which experience very low and very high temperatures. How does their rail infrastructure cope with extremes?

It seems like they all fight cancer (glioblastoma specifically) and could inevitably some day cure people's cancers.  There have been hundreds of studies, but as near as I can tell there has never once been a single study that tested these in live humans, without being administered in combination with chemo and radiation.  I heard a long time ago that they will never ever do that because if a person dies then someone gets blamed for not using chemo and radiation.  That kind of logic seems designed to forever prevent there from being any kind of cure or alternative to chemo and radiation, ever.

Do they ever do any in vivo studies on any (new or existing) cancer drugs that are not designed to see if the drug can &quot;assist&quot; chemo and radiation?  If not, is there any &quot;path forward&quot; for anyone to ever develop a drug that actually cures cancer?

If our cells contain DNA and DNA contains data and if I want to decrease the total amount of &quot;data&quot; stored in my body, will losing fat help with that? 

Sure I will be a lot slimmer visually but if a cell has the same number of dna/data regardless of size, then would losing fat purely from a Data minimization perspective, not make sense?

I'm curious is there is some difference between the high number of cows and the methane they produce and the formerly high numbers of bison and the methane thry produced? Please help me understand.

Text: Take for example

 2 H² + O² -&gt; 2 H²O

This is a combustion, so there's energy being released, and whenever there's energy coming from matter, I'd assume E = mc² comes into play.

But from what I've learned in school, and also the result I get when I try googling this problem, is that the mass *does not* change at all, and it makes sense, if you put 4 mol of hydrogen and 2 mol of oxygen in, you'd expect the same amount out with their respective masses.

But if that's the case, where does the energy released come from? Is that some sort of potential energy I'm not aware about?

But why is there this hydroxydione left at the 3-Phosphoglycerate? Isnt it supposed to be just a carbonylgroup?

Text: Hi reddit,

after my last question I read a bit more about materials in tech, and it's absolutely fascinating. I thought it was all just plastic and silicon, but there is a whole world of strange stuff out there.

I wanted to know what you can find in a phone and found those two cool papers:

    https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11664-014-3310-3
    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5940856/

They both ground down phones and analyzed their content. One thing was strange: Most things are somehow consistent over different phones (with some like lead becoming way less after RoHS in 2006, makes sense), but one is really strange: thallium.

In the second paper, it is found in some phones in the range of 20-300 mg/kg phone, but in most phones it does not appear at all. Same for the first paper: It is found in only 4 of the over 80 phones, with contents between 4-80 mg/kg phone. I could assume that they just did not find it even if it was there in the second case, but it does not sound correct to assume that if in the first paper they only found it very few of thos over 80 phones. I found many speicalized applications, but solar panels and medical equipment don't sound like phones. I also found a combination where it was used for wireless communications, but I can't find info on this in phones, so maybe that is more some kind base station material? Also if it is used as a dopant in semiconductors its concentration would be much much lower than it is in the phones where it was found. Since on this subreddit there seems to be someone knowledgable for every topic:

Where and how is thallium used in phones and in tech general? Is it in some chip on the PCB, in the display or somewhere else, which function does it have and why is it only found in some of them?

PS: The flair is hard, others could also fit...

Apparently, their parents had taught them that if you pour hot liquid into a glass, it will explode, and to always use appropriate kitchen equipment (ceramic cups in this case). I had never heard of this before. We discussed this notion and did some googling and it seems that if you pour liquid with a large temperature difference to the glass into it, it can indeed make it fracture. So now we're wondering: 

1. Why does a rapid temperature change make glass fracture?

2. Can glass actually explode if the temperature difference is large enough? (e.g. taking a glass out of the freezer and pouring boiling hot liquid into it)

Thanks in advance and Cheers

Text: I understand that delusions aren’t that simple, and that there are many, many other delusions that one can have. 

But it seems to be a common theme that schizophrenics tend to believe there are surveillance devices monitoring them, which can make them feel unsafe even in their own home. 

Before the advent of surveillance technologies, we’re paranoid people able to better cope in the safety of their own home? Do we have any data or primary sources on this?

Text: I was reading from here, in the literature:

&quot; Also in 2014, Waldinger et al. offered the first evidence that the genital anesthesia in PSSD may involve a peripheral component \[[33](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6004927/#ref033)\]. A 43-year-old male developed penile anesthesia and scrotum hypesthesia on paroxetine which persisted after stopping the drug. He had attempted to assess the level of insensitivity by applying Tiger Balm to his penis, but felt nothing except a vague sensation over his scrotum. A small degree of tactile sensitivity was regained following treatment with low-power laser irradiation, though there was no improvement in sexual responsiveness. It was hypothesized that SSRIs may disrupt the normal functioning of transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels. &quot;

&amp;#x200B;

By what mechanisms can this happen? Penile anasthesia seems to be a disruption in the ionic channels, but how can this persist even when one is not taking the drug.

Different sources use different terms and models to describe it and no websites I've searched have really yielded me the answers I'm looking for. Right now I'm trying to figure out what clade vascular aquatic plants are in because from my understanding, they can't be in Tracheophyta, because those are specifically land plants. Is there a larger clade that forms *all* vascular plants, or am I thinking about this too hard and that's not how it works? From my studies I've also found that some websites just use clades to substitute other taxonomic ranks such as phylum and class. Is that appropriate or should they be in a proper rank, not just a clade?

When I don’t get enough sleep (like last night I worked late and had to wake up early and only slept about 3 or 4 hours) I feel euphoric, though still exhausted, I just feel optimistic and prevailing happiness and like I have lots of dopamine.

This lead to the question of whether or not the amount of water in your system can effect how much caffeine you absorb from coffee. I looked it up and besides the mass of articles saying coffee dehydrated you, I only found one source that was kinda close which said that if you're more hydrated when you drink coffee you'll get better effects from the caffeine, and another article saying that drinking a lot of water will help flush your system of caffeine. The only remotely close article was written 6 years ago and lacks any medical sources.
I'm just a barista with a very basic understanding of how caffeine effects the body, mostly through my own experience. The somewhat contradictory information isn't very helpful and I was wondering if there was anyone who knows this stuff who could help me out.

Is this another example of independent organisms becoming functionally dependent on each other (like one of the steps along the way during the incorporation of mitochondria), or is this a case of convergent evolution?

As a follow-up, if they are relicts of independent organisms, do they have their own specific genetic lineages?

After all, it's more better in a lot ways than carbon fiber, especially in cost. Like, you can make your own graphene at home-type cheap. 

BAC motors made a sports car that has graphene body panels, probably using graphene in its' fiber form, that's what I think is most likely how they used it. I read an article about it, but the article didn't say how the graphene became as applicable as carbon fiber, like how BAC used carbon fiber.

Text: Two EM waves traveling from point A to B must reach point B at the same time. A wave with higher amplitude will travel a greater distance than a wave with lower amplitude if wavelength is the same. This means that a wave with higher amplitude should propagate faster.

Text: I watched a Physics 2 final review video before my class starts this semester to get a look at what I’ll learn this year and while taking notes I saw that the diffraction grating equation was d*sin(θ) =  m*λ which was very similar to the Bragg’s Law equation I learned in chemistry last year: 2d*sin(θ) = n*λ.

I watched a khan academy video on the double slit equation formula and understood it as a very good approximation allowed when the d is very small and the distance of the screen is relatively far away.  

If in any way these equations can be related, I’d Bragg’s law also an approximation.

I know these deal with different things but I I noticed they were similar and thought maybe by chance there might be some commonality.

This also got me thinking about the fact that China produces so much of the products that are used by countries all over the world. Is the CO2 in those productions, added to Chinas total CO2 emissions. In my reasoning, if I, who live in Sweden, buy a car from China, the CO2 emissions from producing that car should be added to Swedens total CO2, and not Chinas. Is this how these things are usually calculated?

Text: I feel like I have been lied to about tectonic plates.

I have done some research into tectonic plates in an attempt to create a realistic fantasy world, but I seem to be confusing myself.

People talk about oceanic plates and continental plates, but looking at tectonic plates maps show that most tectonic plates have both conitental and oceanic crust.

Is the idea of them being separate plates a lie? Are they just kind of random and could have been anywhere? Also, do tectonic plates changed direction over time? Are there any good sources of information for this?

I will also have to teach this to 10 year olds at some point, so anything geared towards that age that answers my questions would be great, but not necessary.

My question is; when litmus paper is left (away from acid, but exposed) should it stay the same colour? I only ask this as when we tear a piece off the roll a bit of it still sticks out of the container and guaranteed everytime that little bit turns dark red. We have asked our health and safety and one just ignored the question whilst the other said it was just what happens to it when exposed. By it turning red just sat away from acid does that mean ventilation is shit and we're all just breathing in acid? For example, out of curiosity I took a strip home in the car with me and that's still the same colour it was yesterday when I took it (orangey, yellow)

Text: I think my question stems from a misunderstanding of the balancing act nuclear reactors play. My understanding is that prompt neutrons comprise of almost all neutrons produced in a reactor (&gt;99%), while delayed neutrons provide the rest (&lt;1%). Due to how quickly prompt neutrons are created (on the order of a few nano seconds), reaching prompt criticality results in a dangerous power excursion too fast to control for. Therefore, we keep the reactor just under prompt criticality and have the delayed neutrons provide the rest to reach criticality and therefore a sustained chain reaction (prompt sub-critical and delayed critical).

So, let's say a reactor is currently in this balancing act and has reached a sustained/controlled reaction and is producing 1000MW. The electricity demand has gone up and now the power plant wants to increase power to 1500MW. How is this possible without tipping over the already very fine balancing act into prompt criticality? Put another way, how can a reactor have a dynamic power output when increasing or decreasing power by a significant amount means either a power excursion or fizzling out?

Text: I was speaking to someone about whether or not you can take too much vitamin D in supplement form. Then that led to the observation that if your skin makes vitamin D when exposed to the sun, wouldn't that mean you would OD on vitamin D from being in the sun too long? From what I've read you pretty much can't take too much vitamin D even in supplement form, but besides that I'm curious about how much your body will make for itself in a given time and whether or not it can turn the function on and off.

My impression was that each shot remains effective for around 6 months. For myself and others I know under 50, we're well past that point.

Even when dirt gets kicked off the ground it either settles or becomes blown away and loses its visibility. How is it then that clouds can retain their form outside of a closed environment and still be able to be seen. I’ve never really understood clouds and the way they are visible despite being small individual vapor and dust particles in the atmosphere, and it is counter intuitive to me that clouds don’t disappear.

Text:  

If we have a population of normal and cancer cells, and we give a drug to this population. And lets say this drug induces apoptosis. Usually, the drug would have a detrimental effects on the cancerous cells, but would pretty much cause the normal cells to be unaffected. How is that? If the drug can induce cell death in both normal and cancerous cells, why do the cancerous cells tend to die first? Is it because cancerous cells are way better at metabolism than non-cancerous cells, and so they suck everything from their environment; Therefore the normal cells get a small quantity of the drug, while the cancerous cells consume most of it and hence die?

(I know that some drugs might target  molecules that are unique to cancerous cells. However for the ones that are non-specific, how do these drugs manage to destroy our cancerous cells pretty well, while sort of not over-harming our normal cells)

Text: I understand the magnetic and electric fields are related, but from what I understand magnetic-only and electric-only fields can also be generated. I want to understand what kind of force these fields exert on magnetized and/or charged particles.

We have the Lorentz force: F =qE + (qv x B), but my confusion with this equation is that it takes into account only the charge, so, if the net charge is 0, then there is no force applied. Then, what about a particle that is not charged, but still has a magnetic dipole? Is there a general equation like Lorentz force to understnand such systems? I tried to look into magnetic dipoles and torques, but I am confused.

In the questions below, magnetic objects can be considered as objects having a magnetic dipole. So my question is, 

*What is the force exerted by ...*

1. an **electric field** on a charged, non-magnetic object?

The charged particle will follow the electric field lines (F=qE).

2. an **electric field** on a neutral, magnetic object?

As it is neutral, we have, q=0, so there is no force applied.

3. a **magnetic field** on a charged, non-magnetic object?

If it has velocity, it will have the result of a cross-product q(vxB), so the force will change the direction of the movement (right hand rule), but if the velocity is 0, then there is no force applied.

4. a **magnetic field** on a neutral, magnetic object?
So, according to equation, we never take this interaction into account. But, magnets do align themselves to magnetic fields, correct? Then, how so?

Are the conclusions correct? I am especially confused about 4.

I've tried googling this and always seem to end up down the rabbit hole of antibacterial soap which is not what I'm asking about. 

I have a BS in biochemistry, and in labs in school we routinely used detergents to disrupt the lipid membranes of bacteria to extract proteins and genetic material. However, I did not take any specific microbio courses so I have have some blind spots from lack of exposure. Are there bacteria that cannot be lysed by detergents and friction? If so, how do they accomplish this (my guess is cross-linking peptidoglycans)?

However this got me thinking, is there any strong evidence that the reflective nature of white paint used on airliners helps combat exposure to UV-A, B or ionizing radiation for the occupants?

Text: Consider the potential due to a pure dipole... It's 
V=k(p.r)/|r|^3 ... where r is position vector of the point at which the potential is considered and p is dipole moment of the charge distribution... 

Because the net charge Q=0, p remains the same even if we shift the origin... Now consider shifting the origin such that |r| remains the same but r doesn't so that p.r has a different value now... Therefore V has a different value in this frame...

Why? Isn't the potential at a point just the potential difference between this point and a chosen reference point(which happens to be infinity in this case) which shouldn't change unless you change the reference point itself? 

Any explanation???

Text: In the pool yesterday and I was wondering, could I have much the same experience of floating in the water if I were on a low-g planet? Not water - at low-g I'd think that water would push me up too much, like, I wouldn't be able to swim down as easily.

So, is there some lower-density fluid that, on the moon, I could swim in and have much the same experience as swimming in water on earth?

And same for a high-g planet, could I swim in something heavier and have much the same experience (though I suppose the weight of my organs etc pushing on one another wouldn't change - I'd still feel the same *inside*)?

Text: I understand that in an isolated system entropy tends to increase, but I’m having trouble picturing what an increase in entropy of a space rock would look like. Is a space rock constantly losing molecules on its surface as time goes on, and eventually there’s no rock left and the molecules also break down? How would the bonds holding the surface molecules to the interior break apart in a vacuum? A rock in a vacuum seems so permanent from my perspective but I know surprising things happen over huge timeframes. 

Thanks a lot for reading.
