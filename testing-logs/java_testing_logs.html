Text: I keep hearing that the Red Spot on Jupiter is falling apart with smaller red flaked storms spilling away, but how true is it? Is this just some kind of awe tactic or is it true?

And second, if it is true would it be possible that Jupiters red spot separates into a few equal sized spots or something along those lines? Just a really random thought

Text: How can you ensure that the one you want to condition ends up the one being conditioned?

To paint a hypothetical situation for an example, let's consider a child who starts out liking its teddy bear, but because that teddy bear was often present along with another (negative) stimulus, it began fearing or even hating the teddy bear. How can you determine which of the stimuli will be conditioned? 

And can you somehow &quot;force&quot; a particular one of them to be conditioned? Could you perhaps use that teddy bear to condition a negative stimulus (like fear of the dark) into a positive stimulus (eg. an apathy/ambivalence towards the dark, or perhaps even fascination with the dark)?

Text: It seems as if the [Toba Catastrophe Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toba_catastrophe_theory) is on the way out. From my understanding of the theory itself, a genetic bottleneck that occurred ~75,000 years ago was linked to the Toba VEI-8 eruption. However, evidence showing that societies and cultures away from Southeast Asia continued to develop after the eruption, which has seemed to debunk the Toba Catastrophe Theory.

However, that still doesn't explain the genetic bottleneck found in humans around this time. So, my question is, are there any theories out there that suggest what may have caused this bottleneck? Or has the bottleneck's validity itself been brought into question?

Text: This has been a question that’s been really on my mind regarding monkeypox and really other viruses in general. All the media and public health education literature states the virus spreads from “close skin to skin contact”. But what exactly does that entail on a microscopic level for the virus (or other viruses spreading like this)? 

Can this virus actually penetrate intact skin? For example if enough viral particles touch my forearm can it penetrate into my body? Or does it need to make contact eventually with a mucous membrane such as my mouth? 

As a secondary question: would good hand hygiene have a significant impact on prevention from contracting it?

Text: I've always wondered why some types of cancer are more common than others. Especially breast cancer, what is it about the cells there that make easier to get cancer there than in other parts of the body? I know lot of cancer can be directly caused by someone's lifestyle like lung cancer for smokers, and I can kind of guess at ovarian and testicular cancer being common because I'd guess that since that region is just really like used a lot, with a lot of specialized stuff happening there all the time it makes sense.

Text: I have been thinking about trying some new ear plugs for concerts and really want to protect my hearing. 
**Do the high fidelity ones truly protect your ears better or do they just sound better than foam ear plugs that block more sound? My goal is hearing protection even if it cost some sound quality.**

What’s the difference between high fidelity ear plugs (Eargasm, Downbeats, Flare, etc.) and Mack’s foam ear plugs? 
Mack’s block out 32dB-38dB while most of the high fidelity brands I see only block 18-21 dB?

I understand you can supposedly hear the music clearer with the high fidelity plugs, but it let’s in more noise which seems like that would be more likely to damage your ears.

Thanks!

Everything makes sense, but it left me with some questions: how does the heat get released when a substance freezes? From my basic thermodynamics &quot;knowledge&quot;, molecules have kinetic energy that they transform by bumping into other molecules. But when a substance freezes, the molecules lose this kinetic energy - how? Energy cannot be destroyed, so where does it go? Do they suddenly &quot;black body radiate&quot; all of it away? Does it mean that they emit photons that transfer this energy away?

Text: We observe our world through the light visible to our eyes, however there are know organisms who see different wavelengths, bees for example can see ultraviolet light. Could there be planets where potential lifeforms might have to evolv to see x-rays or microwaves in order to observe their world?

If some planets received a different composition of light waves than ours I suspect it might be possible but I don't know if that is physically accurate. 

I know there are different types of stars and I know that the consensus is that a planet needs to be in the 'goldilocks zone' of a star to support life.

Thought I might ask here and hope it's not a completely stupid question haha thanks.

Text: A friend and I were arguing about the color of a car. I said it was pink. He said it was purple. I'm not a native speaker of English, so I wondered if that had perhaps something to do with it - perhaps my mother tongue delimited pink and purple differently than English. But asking some Americans, I found out that actually the jury was split. This got me thinking...  


\- Are some color boundaries fuzzier / more ambiguous than others? For instance, yellow might not be as contentious a color as others, but that is just my impression. 

  
\- If some color boundaries are fuzzier than others, is that consistent across languages? For instance, is the boundary between green and blue always fuzzy?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Are there any biological bases for color definitions, anchored perhaps in color perception and processing?  


I realize that this question straddles many disciplines, so I flaired it with Psychology but it could as well have been linguistic, anthropological etc.

Text: I'm an Assistant Astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) and an Associate Research Scientist at Johns Hopkins University. Here, I lead teams that focus on optimizing the scientific output from the JWST mission, with a particular focus on exoplanet atmospheric characterization, as well as teams focused on developing cutting-edge science for this exciting field of research using both ground and space-based facilities.

I participated on the team that produced the first images and data for JWST (the Early Release Observations ---- EROs) --- and led the analysis that produced the first exoplanet spectrum (of many to come!) that was shown to the public of the exoplanet WASP-96b. I'm also part of several teams working right now on producing the very first scientific results on exoplanet atmospheres with JWST, which range on exciting new science from highly irradiated, gas giant exoplanets all the way to the very first observations with JWST of the small set of terrestial planets orbiting the TRAPPIST-1 star.

I was recently featured as one of the experts in NOVA's documentary film, Ultimate Space Telescope, about the engineering behind the JWST. You can watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF-7eKtzAHM

Ask me anything about:

+ What are exoplanets? Why are they interesting to study with JWST?
+ What new frontiers will JWST explore in the field of exoplanet atmospheres?
+ What can JWST tell us about exoplanets orbiting stars other than the Sun? What can it tell us about our own planet?
+ What are the kind of results we should expect in this first year of JWST observations?
+ What can we expect for the future?

Before joining STScI, I was a Bernoulli Postdoctoral Fellow at the Max-Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany. In 2018, I was selected as the recipient of one of the prestigious IAU-Gruber fellowships by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) for my work on the field. I did both my undergrad (2012) and PhD (2017) at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, in Santiago, Chile, where I was born and raised.

I'll be on at 3pm ET (19 UT), AMA!

Text:  From Newsweek

&quot;NASA has spotted a bright solar flare erupting from the side of the sun, suggesting a particularly active solar region could be rotating this way.

The flare can be seen in the [video](https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/latest48.php?q=0304) above that was captured by [NASA](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nasa)'s Solar Dynamics Observatory on Sunday. In it, a contorted plasma structure can be seen moving on the left-hand side of the sun shortly before it erupts into space.

Solar flares are eruptions of electromagnetic radiation from the sun that travel at the speed of light. The increased levels of X-ray and extreme ultraviolet radiation carried by flares can have an effect on Earth's ionosphere—a region of the atmosphere containing electrically-charged particles.&quot;

Some articles are more sensationalist, suggesting that it could knock out radios and electrical devices.

What exactly does this mean from a scientific perspective, and what are the risks associated with it?

Original Antigenic sin is a concern for me.

So my question is, of all the other available surface epitopes of the virus, how much mutation has been going on there? I would wager that the Spike protein faces the most evolutionary pressure right now with the amount of vaccinated people. Are other surface antigens as variable?

What would be the advantages/disadvantages of an inactivated vaccine (e.g. *Valneva*) for a fourth vaccination?

The only time in which I could see this being useful is if-whether weather conditions occur at corresponding hPa levels--if i could replace temperature, chance of rain, is it sunny or cloudy, etc. with it.. I have no idea what I'm talking about.

If it is unique to water, what about water causes it?

Text: The patellar tendon goes from behind your kneecap to the front of your tibia (shinbone) and can get painfully inflamed or partially torn, sometimes referred to as Jumper's Knee. One method of dealing with that pain is to wear a tight strap around the leg across that tendon just below the knee - the straps usually have a hard lump that presses down on the tendon.

Anecdotally (and personally), this seems to really reduce the pain. But why? Usually, pressing on an injury would hurt more, not less. Here, the strap's functionality seems to be purely mechanical - it's not some &quot;copper infused fabric&quot; or anything like that - cinching it tighter seems to improve the result (until it's so tight it's cutting off blood flow), and removing the strap immediately removes the benefit. Why does this apparently help, and why does pressure on the patellar tendon seem to make it more stable? Is it applicable to any other tendonitis injuries?

Text: First and foremost, apologies for the rudimentary question and with that, here is my question:

&amp;#x200B;

Embarrassingly, I've done this on more than one occasion and today got a bit of scalded.   Was heating up some oat milk (sometimes cows milk or plain water will also do this) in the microwave and when I put the frother in, the liquid starts to well up.   Is this due to the properties in the wand and or the temperature change?  The reaction is quite violent depending on how hot the liquid is.    


My palm is likely going to blister and require some time to heal.   I mentioned that it happened before so why haven't I learned my lesson?  Because it doesn't happen all the time which I'll put it to the temperature of the liquid.   9/10 times it has little to no reaction.   I think this time superheated it because due to the confluence of less liquid volume and the temperature of the wand which may have been colder than usual since the AC was on.

Text: I was thinking about the JWST and it’s incredibly extreme temperature gradient from heat-shield side to cryo-cooled instrument block, all over a physical space of maybe a few meters. 

Is the fundamental limit to how fast a temperature can change based of a plank length, or something else? I suppose it must be linked to fundamental forces and atomic motion, but I can’t really get an intuitive sense of what might limit the speed of temperature change. 

Cheers!

\*Edit: I appreciate the answers so far, but I think I gave too many examples. I'm most interested in understanding why a little bit of water on my finger tips makes it easier to open very thin plastic bags, and that hasnt been mentioned yet.

Text: I've noticed this across several brands when I buy liquid paracetamol for my child. Bottles advertised for infants are 100mg/ml, whereas those for 1+ or 2+ yrs (brand dependent) are only around 24mg/ml.

The ratio depends on the brand but they're all roughly the same. Is there a biological/pharmacological rationale behind this? Suddenly having to give four times as much can be off-putting to a toddler who hates medicine (I'm lucky that we don't have that struggle at home, but the point stands).

It seems  more expensive to me, so I don't see the cost-saving angle.

Edit: both types come with syringes to dose, so it's not about precision of syringe vs cup/spoon.

Text: We are taught in 7th grade that mass is conserved. We are later taught that momentum and energy are conserved.

Up to a constant, these are roughly given by m\*v^(0), m\*v^(1), and m\*v^(2), respectively.

Of course, this is not exactly precise. Mass can become energy, kinetic energy can become potential, et cetera.

I know that the latter two of these come from Noether's theorem and symmetries of the universe (resp. spacial and time translation). But I've also heard about violations of various symmetry, though I'm not a physicists so I often don't really understand the details.

So, I have a few questions, hopefully all somewhat related to this introduction and the title question.

Is there a symmetry/condition under which m\*v^(3) is conserved? Is there a (violated?) symmetry from which we could derive conservation of mass? What about m\*v^(n)? 

And I suppose this is maybe a bit more tangential, but when we say a symmetry is violated, what does that actually say about the universe? If time crystals show that time translational symmetry is &quot;violated&quot; does that mean we are wrong to assume time translational symmetry elsewhere? Or is it a matter of &quot;well, as far as we can tell, everything else is still time symmetric&quot;?

Text: I've been quite fascinated all my life about the original Severn Bridge, which is around 40 miles from where I live. Last week I was able to get the opportunity to walk across it and found it surprisingly stable. Something that seems fairly unique about the Severn Bridge compared to most suspension bridges around the world would be that its cables are in a diagonal, almost triangular pattern, rather than being vertical like on most other suspension bridges. The Humber Bridge in the UK also uses the same unusual diagonal cable design that the Severn Bridge uses, yet for some reason the vast majority of large suspension bridges built outside the UK in the past 50 years still use the traditional vertical cable design, despite it seeming less stable. The timelapses I've seen of most suspension bridges that use vertical wires seem to have noticeably more deck movement than the few with diagonal/triangular cables.

I've done some experiments with different bridge designs in the free piece of software Bridge Designer 2016, and found that giving a bridge the diagonal/triangular cable layout found on the Severn and Humber Bridges in the UK made it much more stable than the same design with traditional vertical cables. Since this seems to be the case, is there a reason why the majority of suspension bridges outside of the UK have continued to be built with the more traditional layout? I know that the Severn Bridge was a world first in its use of diagonal/triangular cables, but any patents that may have been registered during its design and construction would have almost certainly expired by the mid-late 1980s (it was opened in 1966).

I currently work as a scribe in pediatric cardiomyopathy and see a lot of HCM, and knowing the pathology of ventricular hypertrophy got me wondering if there was a risk on RV or LV hypertrophy in fighter pilots due to chronic exposure due intense +Gs

I read one study from Israeli fighter pilots that found no difference in cardiac dimensions by echocardiography when comparing pilots exposed to +Gs vs. -Gs (compared over a 5 year period). However are there studies that compare cardiac dimensions and functions of pilots to the baseline population not exposed to these type of G forces?

So if we have two entangled particles and we send one out to orbit Jupiter (or anywhere far away) on a spaceship, can the people on the ship know if the particle is still entangled without disrupting the entanglement and without communicating at all with the people holding the other particle on Earth?

What if we had the tech to send sets of 26 entangles particle pairs on the ship, for simple example we send 3 sets of 26 entangled particles, and designate each pair in each 26 set a letter of the alphabet, then the people on earth interrupted the pair, in the first set of 26, with the designation of the letter Y causing it to disentangle so the people on the ship would know that we disentangled the letter Y pair. Then the second set the people on Earth caused the pair designated letter E to disentangle, and then the third set they disentangle the pair designated letter S, have we not just communicated FTL?

Text: My kids were asking me why high altitude is colder than lower. The answer, I understand, is that the air is thinner. The thinner the air, the fewer air molecules colliding with your body and therefore less energy transferred to your body, and therefore colder. (correct?)

But that got me thinking. Air is a good insulator, compared to, say, the ground, because it is a gas and therefore less dense, and therefore provides less capacity for heat transfer, right? So as you get higher and the air gets thinner and thinner, wouldn't this insulating property INCREASE? If so, wouldn't your body would retain more of its heat as you went higher and therefore feel warmer, not colder? 

But experience shows this isn't true. The top of Mount Everest is definitely colder than the base. Why? What am I missing about this relationship between gas / density / heat / warmth?

While they seemed to thrive elsewhere, they eventually went extinct in the Americas until being reintroduced by Europeans in the 1500s.  Since then, wild horse populations have again thrived in the new world.  So, why were they wiped out, and why did this not effect Eurasian horses?

Text: I was reading the wiki page about acardiac twins, which states the following:

&gt; The acardiac twin is a parasitic twin that fails to properly develop a heart, and therefore generally does not develop the upper structures of the body.

How does the lack of development of a heart, hinder the development of the upper body? Why isn't the lower body (as) affected? (generally the legs do grow, just not properly)

Does it have something to do with the lack of proper oxygenated blood?

Text: Forgive the weird question, but I was curious. From what I understand bicephaly in reptiles is typically caused by either genetic or environmental factors, the most common being abnormal incubation temperatures. I was wondering if there is any sort of physical trauma that could result in bicephaly, such as an egg being dropped or slightly damaged? If so, would it be possible for scientists to make a notch in a developing embryo and encourage bicephaly? I know it's kind of morbid, but I was really curious as to whether or not physical environmental factors have an impact on this since I couldn't find many sources surrounding it!

Text: I would guess that more body weight, regardless of muscle or fat, leads to a shorter lifespan since the more body mass you have, the harder your internal organs have to work, wearing them out faster, but I'm not completely sure.

Edit: I am referring to human body weight, but studies on other organisms are ok too.

Edit 2: Interesting answers here. I didn't take into account that more cells in the body might also mean an increased risk for one of them to become cancerous, but it can be different for other species. I guess at least for humans shorter people have a possible comeback against taller people now haha.

We're aware of the risks and big events that are possible with solar cycle maximums, but since a lot of news stories sound like they're trying to convince us that the sun is about to kill us all, we're looking for something a little bit more nuanced to give us some perspective. My friend is interested in astronomy but *also has astrophobia* so has been looking for something a little more reassuring than articles constantly popping up on his social media recommendations that exaggerate for clicks.

What should we actually expect, and what should we look for in news articles to tell us what we actually need to know?

Text: DNA and RNA are typically &quot;read&quot; in groups of 3 that we call codons. Each of those combinations of bases codes for a specific (but not necessarily unique) protein or other &quot;instruction&quot;, like start and stop. The entire collection of codons in a genome, in their particular order, &quot;defines&quot; an organism, so to speak. 

But where are the codons themselves defined? What determines which groups of 3 bases results in which amino acids? Is it included in the genome itself, like a compiler written in its own programming language? Or is it entirely reliant on the cellular machinery already existing from the parent with the codons pre-determined? I know there are some examples of different codons between different species but also that it's mostly the same among all life; has it really just been passed down through the unbroken chain of reproduction without ever being encoded?

Text: When I say brains I don't mean the conscious, higher-thinking portion of our brain, but the more instinctual part that does stuff like vomiting or fear.

This is a kind of specific question, but anecdotally, I see a lot of stories about people getting food poisoning, and if they know where they got it from (say, potato salad), they end up hating it, even if they loved it before. They often say that it's gross and have a very visceral reaction to it, and from what I can tell, not a voluntary one.

In a similar but slightly different vein, I'm a spheksophobe (wasps), but didn't start being more than wary of them until I had an allergic reaction to them in primary school (not anaphylaxis or anything, it was called a &quot;severe localized reaction&quot; by a doctor but it made me sick for a week). I get pretty nervous and grossed out looking at photos of them, and heaven forbid I am within ten feet of one, but no amount of convincing myself can make me not scared or sick-feeling.

Is this the subconscious brain recognizing that something made us sick after the fact and making us avoid it with a physical and emotional reaction? Or is it our conscious brain remembering what happened and the association is what makes the physical and emotional reaction?

Is it related to the thing where people who had cancer as kids wouldn't be able to stand ice cream because they were given it a lot during chemo, and they had to stop giving childhood cancer patients ice cream because of it?

If any of you have a resource like a PubMed article or something similar, I'd love to read it.

Text: Last April, I was visiting family in Florida when a friend, who works in health care, showed me a memo that she received from the state Department of Health, offering scientific explanation for why gender-affirming care should be denied to children in the state.

I started clicking the links in the memo, and reading what the evidence they were citing actually said. It seemed like they were using those citations in bad faith-that the science actually said something other than what the state said the research says.
And so, I reached out to to the doctors whose work Florida was holding up as rationale for banning transgender medicine for minors. Ten doctors all told me that they didn't know Florida was citing their work - and that Florida is distorting their scientific work to push an anti-transgender (and anti-science) agenda.

Earlier this month, my colleagues at VICE News and I published an investigation of our findings, showing that this is part of a larger pattern of Gov. DeSantis's administration going to extreme ends - including lying to health care providers - to block transgender kids from getting the health care they need and deserve.

I'll be on at 2pm ET (14 UT), AMA!

However, I can't help but feel like some galaxies are (sometimes heavily) distorted - just like a long exposure shot that was taken with my DSLR. Meanwhile, other galaxies (that seem to be close to the distorted ones) look crisp. 

Am I seeing it wrong? Are these galaxies distorted by gravitational (or other?) effects?

For example, how many holes does a 3 way pipe join have? Or a 4 way cross pipe join? Or like in the title if you had a pipe with a hole connecting to the inside area does that mean it topologically have 1, 2 or 3 holes?

My question is... If we were to compare the global number of mosquitoes+ants+flies living in a general area, would human action have significant influence on their number or no?

Arguments for yes: we (humans) are very invasive, and pesticides are powerful.

Arguments for no: the houses' area are insignificant compared to the wooded/grassy area. More over, we are creating a nutrition-rich environment for these insects and that's why they are around us. So we are killing as many as we produce.

Would it not instead be the case that photons, travelling the speed of light, are contracted across the entire length of travel, and so a single wave would consist of a single photon?

[Another article](https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2022-07-12/james-webb-space-telescope-a-guide-to-the-first-full-color-image.html) mentions blue, green, and red filters (this one is not from NASA, so I cannot verify it's validity). Blue, green, and red are visible wavelengths, so how do these filters work with an infrared camera? Thank you!

Text: The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease says that the accumulation of the peptide amyloid-β in the brain is the main cause of the disease. However, after decades of research and clinical trials there has been little to no success in treating Alzheimer's patients based on this hypothesis, and it has been questioned, see for example:

&gt;[The amyloid hypothesis on trial. As the development of treatments for Alzheimer’s disease continues to stumble, is it time for researchers to broaden their list of the condition’s potential causes?
](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05719-4)

It was recently reported that some western blot images which claim to show a sub-type of amyloid beta, Aβ\*56, may have been manipulated. The report was the result of an investigation by *Science*:

&gt;[Blots on a field? A neuroscience image sleuth finds signs of fabrication in scores of Alzheimer’s articles, threatening a reigning theory of the disease](https://www.science.org/content/article/potential-fabrication-research-images-threatens-key-theory-alzheimers-disease)

Such manipulations the report claims go back to the original 2006 paper describing Aβ\*56 in *Nature*  written by Sylvain Lesné and Karen Ashe:

&gt;[A specific amyloid-β protein assembly in the brain impairs memory](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04533)

From the report in *Science* one may get the impression that the vast majority of Aβ plaque-related research and drug development since then has been focused on the Aβ\*56 subtype, in which case the alleged fraud would be an enormous setback to the field, with billions of dollars and decades of research time wasted. However, there are many types of Aβ and I'm unclear on just how important Aβ\*56 is to the field of Alzheimer's research and drug development. My initial thought was that there's no way all this time, effort, and money has been invested in something that only one lab has published (even if they've published on it many times) and no independent researchers have validated. The *Science* report says that some others have detected Aβ\*56 but I don't know in what context, or if this other work validates the work from Lesné and Ashe:

&gt;In the 16 years following the landmark paper, Lesné and Ashe—separately or jointly—published many articles on their stellar oligomer. Yet only a handful of other groups have reported detecting Aβ\*56.

An article on Alzforum has comments from some of the scientists involved in the controversy:

&gt;[Sylvain Lesné, Who Found Aβ*56, Accused of Image Manipulation](https://www.alzforum.org/news/community-news/sylvain-lesne-who-found-av56-accused-image-manipulation)

In particular, the top comment which is from Karen Ashe, the senior author on the original 2006 paper:

&gt;...it is clear that there are two general forms of Aβ, type 1 and type 2. One particular form of type 1 (referred to in our papers as Aβ\*56 and in the Science article as “toxic oligomers”) was shown by my lab and others to impair memory function in mice. The type 2 form of Aβ is the one found in amyloid plaques. It is this latter form that drug developers have repeatedly but unsuccessfully targeted. There have been no clinical trials targeting the type 1 form of Aβ...

Scientific misconduct or fraud is of course terrible, and if true I'm sure this has set back at least some progress in the field. But just how significant is this fraud if it's true?

Edit: For irrational numbers or real numbers with infinite digits (ex. 1/3), can't we reverse their digits over the decimal point and get the same number? Like &quot;0.333...&quot; would correspond to &quot;...333&quot;?

A cable between the alternator and battery is cut : the battery does not charge. What happens to this generated energy? It can't be noise/heat/light. 

Energy can't be created or destroyed so where does this kinetic energy go?

Text: Let say at some point somebody is born with a beneficial mutation (e.g. darker skin in region with a lot of sunlight). If they mate with someone from the original population, this mutation is only partially noticeable in the children (e.g.children of mixed race parents are not as dark/light as their parents). And when these children have children of their own with partners of the population-without-mutation the trait is even less present 
You can see where this is going... the mutation gets   'dilluted' over the different generations. 

Obviously,  mutations do spread over a population. But how?

Text: Recently, I've been looking at the way pharmaceutical and food-grade phosphorous-based compounds such as [phosphoric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoric_acid) are made. Wikipedia says high-purity phosphorous is produced via the [&quot;dry&quot;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoric_acid#Dry_process) or [&quot;thermal&quot; process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus#Thermal_process), in which [phosphate minerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate_mineral) \- in this example, [fluorapatite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorapatite) \- are reduced with [coke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coke_(fuel)) and [silicon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_dioxide) in an [electric arc furnace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_arc_furnace), producing phosphorous, [carbon monoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide), [calcium silicate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_silicate)\-based slag, and [calcium fluoride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_fluoride), as in the below equation:

`4 [Ca`^(5)`(PO`^(4)`)`^(3)`F] + 18 [SiO`^(2)`] + 30 [C] → 3 [P`^(4)`] + 30 [CO] + 18 [CaSiO`^(3)`] + 2 [CaF`^(2)`]`

However, this reaction uses coke (the '30 \[C\]' in the equation), [the production of which relies upon fossil fuels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coke_(fuel)#Production), which there's a limited supply of.

[Apparently, however, it's possible to produce steel while using hydrogen gas in the place of coke](https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottcarpenter/2020/08/31/swedish-steelmaker-uses-hydrogen-instead-of-coal-to-make-fossil-free-steel/?sh=72a1f56e2c8b) \- more expensive, but doable and more eco-friendly.

**The question: would it be possible to produce pharmaceutical and food-grade phosphorous while using hydrogen or some other** [**diatomic**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic_molecule) **gas in the place of coke - say, with one of the reactions below?**

`4 [Ca`^(5)`(PO`^(4)`)`^(3)`F] + 18 [SiO`^(2)`] + 30 [H`^(2)`]`

`4 [Ca`^(5)`(PO`^(4)`)`^(3)`F] + 18 [SiO`^(2)`] + 30 [N`^(2)`]`

`4 [Ca`^(5)`(PO`^(4)`)`^(3)`F] + 18 [SiO`^(2)`] + 30 [O`^(2)`]`

I'm aware apatites will also run out eventually, and that silica-containing sand is also in high demand worldwide - I'm just wondering if the process of turning apatites into phosphorus could be disconnected from fossil fuel use. I'm also aware that there are non-fluorapatite [phosphate minerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate_mineral) out there, and that the calcium fluoride in 1st equation is only there because the [feedstock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material) is an [apatite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatite) that includes calcium and fluorine. I'm just using fluorapatite as an example.

As of mid-June, there were over 2100 reported cases of monkeypox in dozens of countries. While a great deal is already known about the science of the monkeypox virus, this outbreak has raised several new questions about its transmissibility and impact on human health in both the short and long terms. With the world's attention heightened to such disease outbreaks due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this seems like a good opportunity to provide answers and help alleviate concerns.

We are experts in infectious diseases who are here to provide the facts about monkeypox and counter the mis-information that has been spreading about this disease. Join us today at 2 PM ET (18 UT) for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology, about the monkeypox outbreak. We'll answer your questions about the symptoms of monkeypox and how it spreads, current strategies for treatment and prevention, and what can be done to contain this (and future) outbreaks. Ask us anything!

Text: I read this article and I'm confused: https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/world/thwaites-doomsday-glacier-sea-level-climate/index.html

From my understanding, the risk of glaciers melting causing sea level rise is specifically with regard to glaciers on land, who would either fall off completely, thus displacing large amounts of water, or slowly melt into the ocean, which adds water to the ocean level.

However, I'm struggling to understand the physics of this specific case - it mentions the glacier is anchored to the sea bed. Thus, is it essentially acting as if it is NOT displacing any water? And if it entirely eroded from beneath, the sea level would thus have to rise to accommodate the displacement of the now floating glacier?

If so, why is it different if a glacier is anchored (I.e connected to the sea bed with presumably no water in between the sea bed and bottom of glacier, as opposed to that very same glacier without being anchored? What about if we assume 99.99% of the glacier bottom was eroded and theoretically that 0.01% of glacier could hold it attached to the sea floor, would it still act the same as if it was 100% anchored and not floating?) 

Thanks for helping my understanding.

Text: From what I understand, molecules bond with each other to form solids, possibly meaning to myself, that molecules only pull each other. 

Suppose you compress a piece of wood along its cross-section. What I imagine is that compressing them will only push and slide the molecules apart, which causes them to get pulled apart until the force exceeds their tensile strength resistance, same with shearing action, where the &quot;knife&quot; only pushes the cross-section of an object, causing that cross-section to be pulled apart from other cross-section. 

That's what I'm curious about.

Text: Hopefully my question is alright! I hope I can get some answers. Lately I've been finding dead baby birds all over my backyard, and I hadn't a clue what was killing them. This morning I heard a terrible commotion and found five squirrels circling an adult collared dove like a pack of wolves. They took turns jumping on her back and attacking her. Then, later, the same squirrels started attacking one another! One seemingly nearly killed the other one - By the end of the fight it was hanging off of a tree branch, mouth open, clearly exhausted. It wasn't even holding onto the branch. Is this normal behavior for squirrels? What's the science behind this behavior? I've never seen it before!

Text: Griffths says that in the case of an orthonormal basis, the inner product of two vectors can be written very neatly in terms of their components...

&lt;a|b&gt;=a1\*b1+a2\*b2+....+an*bn 

But in order to know if a set is orthonormal or not we need to be able to calculate the dot product &lt;e_i|e_j&gt; and check if it is equal to del(ij) without actually being able to represent them (basis vectors) by some n-tuple of &quot;components with respect to another prescribed basis&quot;..., right? Otherwise we just get stuck in a never ending infinite staircase, isn't it?

So how do we do that? How do we know if the basis is orthonormal? In 3d real vector space we can just talk about projections(we can just visualise the thing) I know.... but how does this projection idea generalise to higher dimensional and also complex vector spaces without having to talk about an inner product?

Text: Summary: Large solid chunk of steel submerged in a solution of copper(ii) sulfate and tin(ii) sulfate (estimated ration of 10-1). Left to sit for 24 hours. Reaction expected to produce precipitates of metallic copper and tin and a solution of iron(ii) sulfate.

Question: Would the copper and tin precipitate out as a metallic alloy, or would they come out as separate layers, crystals, etc.. ?

So... I've been messing around with copper(ii) sulfate for the past few days. One of my ongoing experiments started with putting scrap electronics solder in a solution of the stuff. My idea was the tin and lead would replace the copper and leave a solution of pure tin(ii) sulfate and insoluble lead(ii) sulfate and copper metal. The results were promising as I was left with a beautiful turquoise blue solution along with white precipitate of lead(ii) sulfate and copper collecting on the old solder. My only mistake was that I did not have enough solder, and so the resulting solution was still mostly copper(ii) sulfate.

It was this mixture of tin(ii) sulfate and copper(ii) sulfate that I added a slightly rusted steel hammer head to. I honestly didn't have a plan at this point other then a quick google search to see where iron was in terms of reactivity. Success on that: I now have an almost pure solution of iron(ii) sulfate. I will likely continue using sulfate to juggle metal ions with reckless abandon.

It's the hammer head I sacrificed that I'm really curios about. It's completely covered in copper crystals and I'm pretty certain the tin is mixed in as well. I'll link a picture in the comments. I really want to know if I just accidentally made a copper-tin alloy.

Hi All,

If Climate Change were fake, then it should be easy to prove it by showing that CO2 does not, in fact, convert more light to heat energy as it passes through. They've known about the concept of a &quot;greenhouse gas&quot; for a century, though.

My question is, what is this property of a gas called?

It will be more complicated that just a constant value, because it will be dependent on the particular light wavelengths involved, but it must have a name.

Thanks!

Text: I accidentally spilled dessicant over my greens. As it's saturated calcium chloride I thought it'd be good to submerge and thoroughly rinse a couple of times to get rid of it. Now I've ran an ISO extract on it, it isn't fully solidifying like it normally would. Could this be leftover dessicant? Or could it be due to water/ISO that has refused to fully evaporate?

Pangea broke up around 250 mya, so why don't we find the same trilobites along the northeast coast of the US? Is it just random chance? Different geological processes at work? Erosion?

Text: Hello! First post here so bear with me.
So, ever since I recovered from covid in May 2021, I've had this long covid wheezing and coughing it's not extreme just a little bit don't worry, anyway I was thinking, I just woke up from a night's sleep and I was coughing last night and now this morning. Why do we not cough in our sleep? Does coughing require consciousness? Or is it something else, maybe it could be related to our breathing patterns? Like when you try taking deep breaths to stop wheezing but cough bad while you exhale? Idk, I don't have anything near a biology background. 
Thank you in advance!
Ps:This may or may not be a stupid question so again, bear with me.

Anything that makes it through the process into the liquid oxygen and nitrogen is subjected to at minimum -280F, if not colder. Does this extreme temperature kill everything or is it possible for something to survive at least some amount of time?

I was told recently that if your flame burns blue, it doesn't produce carbon monoxide (or not nearly as much as yellow). I don't see how that would work. The color of a flame (in a commercial gas combustion) is dependent on its temperature, I can imagine maybe, if your flame's yellow it partially burns the gas supplied, leading to more gas in the air, but certainly not carbon monoxide, no?

Text: I've heard with the Omicron variant, people were mentioning that it has become less deadly, which evolutionary speaking, helps it spread more.  I've also heard a similar account for Influenza - that the Spanish Flu became much more 'mild' (relatively speaking) simply because it was more 'fit' if it had a lower mortality rate.

I'm wondering how this relates with regards to other diseases.  For example, is this a factor in what made the successive black plague outbreaks less deadly (with the first one in the mid-14th century being infamously horrible)?  And not to downplay how bad smallpox or measles is today, but was there a time when it was even deadlier, and has since become less deadly?  Or do some diseases always stay at some mortality rate?

Edit: I should add I'm interested because my &quot;common understanding&quot; of why the black plague became less bad is acquired immunity.  But given this recent insight from COVID-19, I'm wondering if this &quot;evolving to less deadly&quot; was relevant for the black plague as well.  And as well for other diseases...

I also know (presume?) a woman is born with all the eggs she will ever have, and menopause happens when a woman &quot;runs out of eggs&quot;. If this is true then shouldn't there be a backup of eggs for a woman to use if they never go through the full process and get released?

I am aware menopause only happens in a few mammalian species: the great apes, orcas, elephants, etc. So perhaps there is some sort of biological clock in our brains?

Text: A few months ago my wife and 7 year old son were bed bound with what we presumed to be influenza with typical symptoms of hhigh temperature,  dry cough, aching body, fatigue, difficulty sleeping.  A few of my wife's friends also had it and although it was self diagnosed we all tested negative for covid so it seems a good guess.  Meanwhile my 3 year old never had any symptoms and I had a mild cough and felt a bit achy but wasn't anything close to bed bound and was happy working, cooking, cleaning and even managed a couple of 10 mile bike rides (my usual route is 15 miles but I felt a bit tired).  In fact at 44 years old I have never been bed bound for more than a morning.

Most people tend to say if you can get out of bed it's not flu, but is that true or can you have flu and have no/ mild symptoms?

****Obviously I'm aware it was self diagnosed and it may be none of us had flu but had something else, I'm just interested if flu is always as bad as people say.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been learning about Piaget recently through the Introduction to Psychology Yale course ([https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6A08EB4EEFF3E91F](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6A08EB4EEFF3E91F)) and I was wondering if it would be possible, maybe through a set of tailored puzzles, to accelerate a child's advancement through Piaget's developmental stages.

 

\- Is there a physical limit for this (possibly that children gain these abilities not only through assimilation with their environment but also the physical growth of brain, therefore such puzzles/toys would not be effective as the child does not have the physical brain capacity to advance in their developmental stage yet?)

&amp;#x200B;

Any studies/videos regarding this topic would be greatly appreciated, let me know what you all think.

I'm asking about a planet's core in particular because there's more mass around it than inside it, therefore it should be logical that it is being pulled outwards, not inwards.

https://www.reddit.com/r/jameswebbdiscoveries/comments/vwuxzv/first_image_of_the_james_webb_discovery_telescope/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

The stars have spikes/flares coming out of them but the galaxies are crisp and clear. Why is that? Is it related to where we are focusing on in the image? 

PS: I read somewhere that stars are the ones with flares/spikes. If not please feel free to correct me.

Text: Assume a person weighs 100kg. They then have a limb immobilized due to injury or other causes, which results in muscle loss from that limb. If their TDEE (total daily energy expenditure, or base metobolic rate + calories burned from activity) remains the same as it was before the muscle loss, will they lose weight? or just lose muscle while maintaining the same weight?

Intuitively I would think that there would either be no change to the persons weight, or maybe even a slight increase since muscle burns more calories at rest than fat which would result in a lower BMR/TDEE. Unless there is some change to metabolism, if calories in = calories out before and after the muscle loss, we would expect no or little weight loss.

Is this assumption correct? why or why not? And if it is, where does the mass that was previously caused by muscle end up?

But..there aren’t right? There were that many galaxies that close together 13 billion years ago, not now.

If what we’re doing is looking into the early universe, and the universe has been expanding since the Big Bang, then aren’t we just seeing those first galaxies as they were closer together than they would be today? 

And if what we’re seeing is the very beginning of the universe then wouldn’t pointing the telescope anywhere else for a long enough time reveal a similar picture? In fact, wouldn’t we technically be seeing even the same early galaxies no matter where you point it at?

Text: *Observations:

Every time I trim my body hair, it grows back.

Now there can be two possible explanations for this:

*Explanation 1:

Body hair growth is continuous and hair grows indefinitely long if left ungroomed.

But I know this is not true, because for the first 18 years of my ife I never trimmed any hair, but they still didn't grow further after reaching a certain size.

*Explation 2:

There is some sort of feedback mechanism that let's the hair root cells know that the hair has been trimmed and they grow enough to compensate for the exact length that has been lost.

*Question:

But if hair is made of dead cells, how exactly can the body tell if that particular strand of hair has been cut

(I tried cutting out a patch of hair for this purpose and it grew to the same length as well after a few weeks)

And the exact length to which it has been cut?

....

I specifically put body hair in my question because I've never tested our the full limit of head hair, so I assumed it grows indefinitely.

Text: I’ve always heard the explanation “because the planet curves away from the moon as fast as it falls towards the planet” but this doesn’t make sense to me. The moon is not falling “down” relative to a universal plane, it is falling straight towards the center of the planet.

Why does the moon not fall towards the planet in a spiral pattern? How does the moon’s momentum “counteract” the constant force of gravity?

If we compare it to a tennis ball on a rope, the tennis ball also does not fall towards the center despite the rope pulling on it, even if the rope is being flexed strongly outwards. But this is because the person is swinging the ball on the rope, providing a constant force tangential to its “orbit.”

A moon orbiting a planet has only one force on it: gravity. There is no tangential force, only tangential motion to to its momentum. How does only its momentum keep it afloat?

Text: I've read that Monkey Pox isn't an STD. So why is MSM, allegedly, the most afflicted group according to the WHO?

Edit: Unfortunately, I feel that the answers aren't clear enough and I still have doubts.

I understand that Monkeypox isn't strictly an STD, and it's mainly transmitted by skin-to-skin contact and respiratory secretions during prolonged face-to-face contact. So, I still don't understand why are the media and health organizations focusing specifically on the MSM demographic.

Even if the spread, allegedly, began in some sort of gay event, any person, regardless of sexual orientation,  could eventually get infected with Monkeypox. It's not as if MSM only had contact with other MSM. They might also spread the disease to their heterosexual friends, coworkers, acquaintances, and relatives.

In the worst-case scenario in which we aren't able to contain Monkeypox, LGBT people who don't even participate in random sexual encounters or social gatherings might get infected by heterosexual carriers.

Shouldn't the narrative be changed to &quot;people who partake in hook-up culture and large social events&quot;? What does sexual orientation have to do with the spread of the disease?

Edit2: I'm reading an alarming number of baseless assumptions and stereotypes about MSM or gay men in general, I honestly thought this subreddit was much better.

Now the first time I saw them I learnt more about Jeremy - a sinister/left coiled snail due to a rare genetic issue(he's like a 1% chance mutation, probs less) - and learned ofc that Sinister snails can't usually mate with Dextral snails and so Sinisters need sinister mates.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_(snail)

NOW. Here comes my question. I see a few Redditors posting in various subs also witnessing Slex(slug-sex) for the first time but HERE is my issue;

Every time I see the slugs coiled up in their coitus - they seem to be chirally inclined to coitus that up the same way.

Now, if snails are Herms but can be sinister on occasion and only mate with Sinisters - is there any chirality of existence in slugs too? Just like you can be a sinister snail instead of a standard and usual Dextral - are there sinister slugs out there who can't find a mate befause they keep just finding dextrals who like it left to right rather than the kinky right to left and they are doomed, like Jeremy(without the intervention of science and human matchmaking) to never ever get their rocks off and have kids, unless their 1% existence chances on another slug of 1% existence as two equally sinister beings???

Text: From what I've seen, hydrogen is a more energy dense fuel than anything else (disregarding things like nuclear fuel), and the fact that the oxidation reaction is 'pure' (in that the only byproduct is chemically stable water) leads me to believe there's no more energy to be gained from the reaction. That said, I have little knowledge of chemistry. Perhaps a fuel with an accelerant (or whatever the correct term may be) other than oxygen has a greater density?

Text: I read that Si and GaAs, which are both used as semiconductors in computer chips, develop a very thin oxidation layer in air. I also read that the one that Si develops is insoluble in water, so it is a good passivation layer, while the one that GaAs develps contains water soluble oxides, so it is not a good passivation.

On the other hand in the industry, the GaAs oxidation layer is etched off with acid, when GaAs wafers are used - why is this done, and not just water used, if the oxides are water soluble? And how can I imagine the oxide layer itself, is it something that is firmly &quot;bonded&quot; to the GaAs or Si underneath, or is it something more &quot;volatile&quot; that is easily removed? As in: is it really part of the surface, or just &quot;lying on top of it&quot;?

I'm not a chemist, I just read a lot about semiconductor materials recently and am curious.

I mean fish have their sim bladder. But what do whales do ? do they &quot;just swim down&quot;? What happens when the air in their lungs get compressed and the average density increases ? How do they stay buoyant at different depths ? 

And what do the sperm whales do when they sleep in this strange buoyant way ? how do they stay buoyant while sleeping ?

Or do they just &quot;overpower&quot; the density change with muscle power ?   


This might be a bit of a convoluted question but maybe someone has some expertise in the area. Thanks :)

I'm curious however if plants absorb pesticides directly into their flesh?

For example avocado... can you spray avocados with pesticides all you want and it will be safe to eat because you are removing the thick external cover? Or will the pesticide leach into the water, and then be absorbed by the plant, then eaten by you?

Or does it perhaps get absorbed directly through the skin?

However if it says it’s going to rain in a week that’ll change 5-6 different times with the percentages and when and if it will even happen at all. Why can the weather guys guess one so accurate and the other is like throwing darts blind folded?

Text: A beekeeper once told me that wasps kill so many bees they reduce polination, and it would be beneficial to drastically reduce the wasp population.

However, I've read that wasps are important polinators themselves, which makes me think we shouldn't really try to wipe them out.

So with these two opposite views: do wasps have a positive or negative overall effect on polination in the world?

Text: To better explain and be more specific...
We have an ice cream food truck. We are trying to mitigate damage in case our storage freezer breaks or loses power.

We have some really &quot;high tech&quot; freezer packs that we're going to put into the freezer, so if the power goes out, the freezer packs keep the temperature as close to 0° as possible.

I would like to run a test to see just how long they'll maintain the temperature (we may be able to transport the cooler to events without having to run a generator). 

But, I don't want to run the test with the ice cream in the freezer (don't want to risk ruining it).

So my question: Does it take more energy to maintain temperature if the freezer is full of ice cream, or more if it's empty? (Fit that matter, maybe it's the same?).

 If I can know this answer, then I can think &quot;ok, so it maintained 0° for X hours empty, and since it will use less/more energy when full, then I can expect +/-X hours when it's full. &quot;

Extra bonus if there's some sort of formula that says &quot;with X amount of mass inside, you can expect +/-X% of time before the temperature exceeds 0°&quot;

I can't seem to wrap my head around it... Part of me says that more ice cream will &quot;absorb&quot; more heat and require more energy to keep them cold. The other part of me thinks maybe the extra mass of ice cream inside will help keep it cold.

Text: So I live in an area where people tend to pee outside a lot.

Tonight I saw someone pee outside - turned away of course while they went - and they left a puddle. Maybe an hour after, a rat came by and sat right in the puddle for a few seconds before scurrying off again.

Curious how long virus (COVID or anything else) stays active in urine once it hits the air.

Thanks in advance.

Update: a lot of discussion here about whether it's possible to transmit viruses through urine - the answer is yes, it's possible. I'm asking how long it stays active outside of the body, usually on the ground (may be different for different viruses/conditions).

Also, whether we should all be worried about the rat.

See CDC page on CMV for one example: [https://www.cdc.gov/cmv/overview.html](https://www.cdc.gov/cmv/overview.html)

Once released into the host cell, however, they have no issues finding and then binding to each other. Why is that?

I have a few questions about this virus because these news articles don't make it too clear:

1. The reported 35 infections: Is that the total number of infections since 2018 or is that the current ongoing infections?
2. If not current, why break this news now and make a big deal of it? And how many are currently infected?
3. Articles say human to human transmission hasn't been identified. How did 35 people presumably get the same virus?
4. Is this virus or it's family of viruses known to be highly transmissible and respiratory like Covid?

Text: Let's make a few presumptions:

Black holes are remnants of massive stars.

The Eddington limit states that a star can only reach a few hundred solar masses at max. A &quot;newborn&quot; black hole would only have a few hundred solar masses at max.

So the only way for supermassive black holes to reach their size would be to consume other bodies. However, due to time dilation, masses approaching the event horizon of any black hole would freeze in time to our perspective, thus making it impossible for any black hole to gain mass.

And even if that is not a problem, most objects approaching a black hole would be slingshotted away simply because space is huge and a black hole is relatively tiny.

How does it work IRL? In which part am I wrong?

If anything, I’d expect it to be the opposite, since sunscreen is liquid/gel-like and doesn’t shatter into a million stubborn crumbs in your mouth like most foods.

Text: We’re taught that T cells require 2 signals for activation (engagement with an antigen-MHC complex and engagement of co-stimulatory molecules that are only expressed in the presence of inflammatory cytokines). When you have signal 1 without signal 2, these peripheral T cells supposedly undergo peripheral deletion or anergy. 

However, during an infection, you do have inflammatory cytokines present, so theoretically self-reactive T cells would receive both signal 1 and 2 and therefore activate. Do anergy and deletion just not occur during an infection? I am assuming there some another mechanism that addresses this but I haven’t been able to find an answer.

So, let's say that I try and directly replicate a study from 1992 on Adolescent aggression and video game usage, I would use all the same materials, so in this case, Street Fighter from 1992 on an arcade machine and then measure aggression using the same surveys from the original study.

It's something I grew up with and never really thought about, but when I looked it up today, I'm not really understanding if the dye itself has any active ingredients.

Text: I vaguely recall hearing that California is on a different tectonic plate than the rest of the landmass that is currently North America. I don't recall if California's tectonic plate is moving away from or into the rest of North America, but it's only a matter of time before it's no longer part of America as we know it. The question is, how long is it going to be before we have to start building literal bridges between California and the rest of North America?

I understand evolution so my question is not how organisms are so well suited for the environment, it's how they can even develop mutations that is suited to live. I feel like we are heads landing consecutively thousand times.

I hope my question is clear I am having a hard time formulating it.

Text: Say there's a cloud of plasma floating in space, and there's a uniform magnetic field around/permeating it. If there is also an electric field present, the plasma will move in the direction of E x B, from what I understand.

Now say there is a beam of laser light shooting through the plasma. Light is made of photons, which are electromagnetic oscillations.

So how does a photon end up affecting the plasma?

One option I could see is that the electric field from the laser and the background magnetic field means the plasma moves in the E_laser x B_background direction.

Another option is that it moves in the E_laser x B_laser direction.

Another option is that it doesn't move but oscillates back and forth along one of those directions, because light is oscillating.

Another option is that it moves in the direction the light was going, because light has momentum and its pushing the plasma. Which is just the 2nd option, but with a different reason.

Another option is that it doesn't move at all and I don't understand photons.

Text: Is there a physical visualization that can help reinforce this? I'm not seeing the relationship between the wavelength and physical object size.

The wavelength of light is continuous, and describes the E/M vector at a point. So if we have an atom at some position X, and we shoot an infinitely thin beam of visible light (wavelength larger than atom's size), the light must travel and hit the atom at position X because the light is continuous. It's not like the lightwave just skips over position X. So the atom should interact with the visible light, somehow. If it were to reflect the visible light back to us, then why can't we see the atom?

Text: (This is probably more of an applied math question, but I don't think Miller indices are used in any context besides crystal structure, and crystal structure is part of physics and chemistry (I'm specifically learning about the topic in an EE course on the physics of semiconductors), so it seemed more appropriate to ask it in the science sub than the math one.)

So just, _why_ the reciprocal?  Like, I can see how we can form a valid coordinate system that way, but it seems like just an unnecessary complication, when we could just use the actual axis intersection points. 

I've been Googling, trying to find an explanation (as my textbook gave no actual explanation of the theory, just a single example of how get the indices) and Wikipedia is the only source I've found so far that even attempts to explain the actual theory. It says that Miller indices &quot;denote the family of (parallel) lattice planes... orthogonal to... the basis or primitive translation vectors of the reciprocal lattice for the given Bravais lattice.&quot;  I mostly understand what that's saying, but I have some questions: first, if we want to represent planes orthogonal to the basis vectors, shouldn't we be taking the _negative_ reciprocals?  Second, why do we want the planes to be perpendicular to the basis vectors in the first place?  And third, why are we working with &quot;the basis or primitive translation vectors of the _reciprocal lattice_&quot; at all?  

I get why we want to &quot;reduce&quot; (not sure if that's the correct terminology) more complicated crystal structures to the 14 Bravais structures, and we studied all those structures pretty in depth when I took chem 102 last year, so I'm pretty comfortable with them.  And I'm solid on basic linear algebra, so I get that going to the Bravais form is really just a change of basis.  What I don't get is why we're working with a basis for the &quot;reciprocal space&quot;.  I looked at the Wikipedia article on that subject and it mentioned that the reciprocal lattice is the Fourier transform of the original lattice -- and alright, I've work with Fourier transforms and similar integral transforms before and I know it can sometimes be simpler to do an integral transform, perform the relevant computation, than get the inverse transform from a table (or a CAS, such as Wolfram Alpha).  But how the heck does just taking the reciprocal correspond to the Fourier transform?  And why would we even _want_ to Fourier transform in this context?

Text: Yes, I'm aware that there have been semi-recent breakthroughs to suggest that the T-Rex had lips that covered its teeth. I'd like to take that one step further by postulating that the T-Rex had gums that fully concealed its teeth.

One thing that made me think about this was that I remembered hearing that the T-Rex likely had a pseudo-venom from the bacteria in its mouth, just like the Komodo dragon. Some sources I found state that the Komodo dragon's mouth bacteria can in large part be attributed to meat and guts that build up in its thick gums.

On the other hand, the Komodo dragon eats its prey whole, while the T-Rex (I presume) tore large chunks at a time, like a crocodile does. 

Anyway, I haven't found any sources that may hint toward the Komodo theory, only ones that reinforce the whole lip thing. Does anyone know if there's any merit to this? Why or why would it not be possible?

Text: Recently there was a heavy downpour and I was told that the nearby library had to freeze dry books/papers in their magazine. Apparently, there had been a small water leak and parts of their inventory got wet.

I have then been searching online, how the process of freeze drying actually works and found several sources. However, while reading I began wondering: These processes usually create ice crystal inside the material they want to dry. How does paper survive this process?

I can imagine, that the paper isn't too rigid, it can bend and deform given pressure unlike cell walls. Cell walls seem to be rather fragile as ice crystals can break them. However, if paper had been completely drenched/soaked in water, I would expect at least some damage to the paper. But apparently, freeze drying seems to be a very safe method, why is that?

Text:  

I did google searched and searched this sub for an answer. The closest I got was the link at the bottom.

I understand that many animals have sperm with short life cycles. I also understand that women are able to keep their same oocyte their whole life's. However eggs are living cells that are still attached to the host body and are being fed/wasted carried away from. Is this the same action that happens inside a queens body's when they store sperm for up to 25 years? Or is there a different mechanism of action?

If you have info related to other animals besides queen ants I'd be interested in hearing it as well.

Text: At a glance, it seems like the efficiency of good generators (80+%?) and  electric engines (80+% too?) still seem to be much higher than the efficiency of ICE engines (&lt;30%?).

If this is the case (please let me know if my assumptions are wrong), why does it seem like hybrid power trains of cars and boats have their combustion engines linked to the power train through a drive shaft rather than just producing more electricity to drive the electric motors? I get the sometimes they might be doing this to get more power and avoid having to install more powerful electric motors to accept the power from the generator rather than just the batteries, but it seems just having more range would a huge advantage. Is there something I'm missing?

Text: I don't know too much about shit like this, so maybe I am misunderstanding something, but I don't understand how we can refer to events that happened in the universe with precise timestamps. From my understanding (very limited), time passes different in different places due to gravitational time dilation. As an example, in Interstellar, the water planet's time passed significantly slower.

Essentially, the core of my question is: wouldn't the time since the creation of the universe be different depending on how time passes in the area of the universe you are? Like if a planet experienced similar time dilation to the one in Interstellar, wouldn't the age of the universe be lower? Is the age of the universe (13.7b years), just the age of someone experiencing the level of time dilation we do? I understand that time is a human concept used to explain how things progress, so I might be just confused.

Anyways, can anyone help me out? I have not read very much into this so the answer is prolly easy but idk. Thanks

But everything I see online, and everyone I ask online explicitly states that DNA tells cells how to build bodies.

If Levin is wrong, and DNA does contain anatomical information, are we able to learn the anatomy of an animal, or even a simple plant *just* by reading the genome? Obviously without comparing it to a related organism.

&gt; &quot;As such, all objects free fall at the same rate regardless of their mass.&quot;

So all objects fall at the same speed regardless of their mass. Therefore, an object's **mass doesn't matter**. Okay.

&gt; &quot;Terminal velocity will depend on the mass, cross sectional area, and drag coefficient of the object as well as the density of the fluid through which the object is falling and gravitational accelleration.&quot;

But now I'm told that **mass do matter**, and that an object with more mass will fall faster?

So do they or do they not fall at different speed...?

I'm thinking about it sorta like if you half inflate a balloon, draw an image on it, and then continue to blow it up, the image would appear stretched and larger.  


My guess; between when the universe first became visible and now, the universe hasn't expanded much and that older galaxies are larger than they appear, but not by much.

 I mean, there are some claims that due to how rigid the reinforced frame in heavy vehicles is, one is more susceptible to organ damage due to how kinetic energy is transferred. 

In case of lighter ones, they are intentionally made in a way that makes the body and chassis &quot;absorb&quot; the energy in order to reduce the damage the crash inflicts on the passengers. 

I guess the outcome of a collision could rely on the differences in weight between the participants.

TLDR: would a heavy vehicle be a better option safety wise? Or are there other factors in play?

Text: We all know that using a lithium ion battery causes it's capacity to decrease over the years. But I am interested in better understanding how different usage patterns impact the speed of this degradation. I've read some about the chemical mechanisms that cause this problem, and I've read several articles on &quot;best practices&quot; for battery health, but I still do not feel like I have a good understanding of everything.

For example, suppose we need to use 20% of the energy of a battery. Is it best for the long term health to only charge the battery up to 20%, and then drain it to 0%, and then back to 20%? Or is it better to go from 100%-80%-100%? Or is the optimal thing to split the middle and go from 60%-40%-60%?

I have also seen it mentioned that charging batteries more slowly improves their lifespan. Is this solely because of reduced heat, or is that still true even if temperature is removed from the equation? I have also seen many mentions of &quot;deep cycles&quot; being bad for the battery, meaning that multiple smaller discharges/recharges in a row are better than a longer discharge. Does this mean that, in the previous example, using the battery from 100%-80%-100% every day is worse for long term battery health than doing four sets of 100%-95%-100% every day?

While I would certainly appreciate any well-informed answer to the above questions, what I am ultimately searching for is a better understanding of the subject that would allow me to answer such questions myself.

Text: So searching for radio telescopes I found that there are almost none currently operating in space and historically very few as well. Most of the big radio dishes in space are turned Earthwards for spying purposes.

As a layperson this strikes me as strange because it seems like a radio telescope would be significantly easier to build and launch than an optical telescope. 

A few possible guesses come to mind based on my small amount of astronomy knowledge:

Fewer advantages over land-based observation, relative to an optical scope?

Interferometry using huge numbers of smaller ground based dishes simply more useful?

Some engineering challenge I'm not considering?

Text: The way I understand it, vaccines use a dead, or weakened, virus. Some vaccines use only parts of a virus (or bacteria). And in the case of the Covid vaccines, they use mRNA technology. 

Now, the way I understand it, once this is introduced into the body, the immune system reacts and neutralizes the antigen. So, when the antigen enters the body a second time, the immune system reacts much quicker. I also understand that microbes can mutate, which has an effect on the vaccine's potency. This is why we have to get a flu shot every year, because the virus mutates. 

However, in the cases of Smallpox and Polio, we have managed to eradicate these diseases by way of vaccines. So, my question is it possible that, with vaccines, we were able to eliminate some diseases with vaccines, but not others? Did these other viruses just not have a chance to mutate? How would we get to the point where we don't let the flu or Covid to mutate? 

Please no &quot;Big Pharma&quot; conspiracies. I just want to know people's thoughts from a scientific standpoint. Thanks.

Text: Good morning askscience guys, I have a question that I've been thinking about for years.  To the point, physiologically the human being has mechanisms to regulate acid-base control, and among them is pulmonary ventilation, in case the blood turns to a more acidic pH, the body generates hyperventilation to regulate the pH.  Otherwise, hyperventilation produces alkalosis.  So here is my question, dogs in hot weather or extreme exercise hyperventilate and do so a lot.  How is it that dogs regulate blood pH quickly without suffering alkalosis when they start hyperventilating?  I appreciate your response in advance, thank you very much.

If you jumped high enough, could you float to the center and just stay there?

I Imagine the moving air around you would eventually build up enough momentum that you'd contact the ground, which might be uncomfortable if it was spinning fast enough.

Text: Hi, I started to ask myself some high-level questions about OGM, 

A) For example, fast-growing is probably one of the most sought features, did we achieve it? (in general, not for every species of tree). If so, is it a « stable » feature, ie. can buy gmo seeds which claim to grow fast, and it actually will?

 B) What other common features can we do? I guess we researched bugs resistance, trunk strength, etc. More specifically, I can also think of seedless grapes

C) More specifically, I was thinking about a feature : endless/long growing branches? I suppose that a normal tree regulates its branches to match with the trunk (otherwise a thin trunk would not be able to support an absurd weight of overgrown branches), also our industries have probably little interest in such a feature.. but still I wonder, can we GM a tree to do that (and handle the consequences of too long branches) ?

Text: If you've got minus lenses lying around you can repeat this experiment with any Camera you have with you.

If you put a minus lens in front of camera lens and focus the camera at a very distant object (~infinity), you'll see that the camera will report the actual focus distance as somewhere in the ballpark of 1/(Power of the minus lens in metres).
Even though the object at infinity will be in apparently sharp focus in the viewfinder, the indicator will still show the camera focused at a close distance stated above.

To answer this, you need to understand how Minus lenses work:
Minus lenses form the virtual image of objects at infinity at their focus - this is what the camera is seeing.

Now what happens, if you want to focus your camera from very far to somewhere near while still 'wearing' minus lenses?
Well, you'll see that the indicated actual focusing distance in your Camera gets even closer than the previously observed distance.

You can verify that the apparent distance of the object and the actual focusing distance of lens optics obeys this formula:
Actual focusing distance = 100 / (100/Apparent distance - signed power of lens kept in front of the camera)

For example, focusing your camera at an object at 50cm while putting minus lenses of glasses of -2 will result in actual focusing distance equal to
100 / (100/50 - (-2)) = ~25cm

This is exactly what I observed with my Fujifilm X-S10.

Now the actual question is this?
Eyes also operate in a manner similar yo to a Camera with lens, aperture etc.

Can I draw similar result for the eyes also??
Specifically is it true based on above results that a Myope's eyes who's wearing -4 glasses viewing an object at 25cm are actually focused at 12.5cm?? And is that the cause of Myopia progression??

My question is if a planet IS tidally locked, how much of the surface could support life?  Is there a very small sliver of land that humans could live on, or is it in fact quite thick?  Do we know by how much the temperature would increase as you walked round the planet?  

I'm asking as it's very difficult to conceptualise a tidally locked planet give we live on one that is spinning!  I presume for example the Sun would be un-moving in the Sky from any one point.

Is that true or just completely bogus? If it is true, how would I be able to see them? Would they be unique to each person like a fingerprint?

EDIT: Holy COW I didn't think this would actually be seen, let alone blow up like it did! LOL! I'm only just now starting to look at comments but thanks everyone for the responses! :D

Text: Like how the current batch of vaccines didn't protect against infection from the Omicron variants, could a variant sufficiently mutate to not be able to be detected by either a PCR or an antigen test? And if it reached that point, would it still be COVID 19, or instead of evolved to the point where it probably deserves a different name?

Text: I was reading the results of a family member's recent genetic test and there are an astounding number of genotype-disease links that they check for. I was wondering if there is some sort of standard of evidence that each of these links has to meet before they are taken seriously and tested for or if there is really no standard and that direct-to-consumer genetics companies (like 23andMe) just offer tests for any possible disease even if the evidence is questionable.

Are all of these links established the same way? I imagine one way would be to trace the biochemical pathway from certain DNA sequence all the way to the proteins they produce and see if the the resulting proteome would result in disease (for example, I think [this is possible](https://sickle-cell.com/causes#:~:text=figure%201%3A%20hemoglobin%20s%20(hbs)%20genetic%20and%20phenotypic%20mutations) for sickle cell anemia). But I imagine the other, (and less reliable?) way would be to look at people with diseases, look at their genomes, and the form statistical correlations, ie. &quot;most people with this disease have this genetic variant, so we will assume this genetic variant and this disease are linked&quot;.

Text: If we take dogs for example.  How much of the typical variation between breeds is epigenetic vs genetic?

And regarding the breeding process - is there some kind of rolling tradeoff where genetic changes accumulate?  By that I mean if you arbitrarily quantified divergence, say 10 units / generation.   Maybe at after 40 units divergence it's 20/20 epigenetic/genetic, but then at 100 units it's 30/70 epigenetic/genetic.

My interest in this stems from fish that live in high-sulfur streams.  There are very few examples but cutting edge work found that many of the adaptions were epigenetic.

Text: One often hears about how when learning new tasks or repeatedly doing new activities, neuronal connections are rewired and become stronger. But not only that, but that the brain areas associated with that task are said to grow.

So for example in violinists the part of the brain associated with fine motor control is larger, or in taxi drivers that for spacial memory. (Or so I heard)

Given that there is finite space in the brain, do other now less used areas grow smaller?

And what does this mean in practical terms for the acquisition of skills? Is there a practical limit to how much a brain can &quot;learn&quot; without unlearning things, or is how much time one can invest into developing and maintaining skills the only limiting factor?

Can someone help and explain to me what individual numbers mean? Thanks, Reddit :)

Text: What will happen to all our buried rubbish? Will it be subjected to pressure as soil accretion builds up over it and be compressed into unknown materials?

 Will it even remain buried, or will erosion expose it and scatter its toxic contents to the wind and sea like some sort of ecological time bomb?

 Or will they eventually rot away to constituent compounds?

Text: Not sure if the title is clear. But I was wondering if chipmunks could have evolved to intentionally hide nuts in a good spot to grow trees, or lose some number of nuts, or something that would benefit growing more trees. They wouldn't personally benefit from that, but their 20-30x great grand children might, which might have some &quot;plant more nuts&quot; genes. Seems remote that there would be enough selection pressure for this specific example, but I was wondering if there are any known examples like this of evolution pressure that acts not on the individual, but later generations.

Text: I was at my local rec center pool and had this thought.

Let's say you have a donut-shaped pool with jets that keep the water moving clockwise with negligible turbulence and a spherical object floating in that pool. Without bumping into the sides, would the ball begin spinning relative to the ground or stay facing relatively the same direction? 

Thinking about the forces involved, my intuition tells me that the force of the water acting on the ball should always be tangential to the donut. Also, would the stream of water keep the ball in the center, or would it be flung to the outside perimeter of the pool? How would the situation change if it were a neutrally buoyant sphere in a cylindrical pipe?

I understand that other arteries say radial are less prone to blockage but what if they get blocked, does the procedure remains same ? Or there are different procedures for non-coronary arteries ?

Text: I am probably not using the correct terminology, so please forgive.  
I am thinking of bifurcation diagrams and global warming in terms of localized weather patterns.  For example, we have had a particularly quiet hurricane season, but it has been ridiculously warm over the Atlantic.  
I am wondering to what extent climate models take into account chaos math, and if we are even going to be able to predict the impacts of global warming with any reasonable accuracy.  I mean, we are definitely going to seriously screw up our planet and possibly wipe ourselves out, but do we have any reasonable idea /how/?  Global warming, ocean acidification, forever chemicals, lots of good fun that is funny....

Text: So I know in a camera that there's a bayer filter that makes color out of a black and white photograph, but for the JWST, it works in near infrared. Some news articles seem to say that it is able to un-red shift images from near infrared, but I assume, since it requires interpolation, that the JWST works in black and white and doesn't have a near infrared bayer filter equivalent. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is by what process is a color image generated from near infrared light? If it requires multiple types of wavelengths, how is that collected because I thought that it was a &quot;black and white&quot; camera sensitive to all unfiltered wavelengths equally

Text: I was reading earlier today about the kinds of ailments that bone marrow transplants are used to treat (as I am thinking about signing up on the registry to donate), and I noted that in the case of leukaemia, chemotherapy or radiotherapy is used to completely destroy the recipient's immune system first.

However, whilst relatively good, there are still figures that suggest that survivability over the years following treatment is not always that high, some still slip through the gaps.

But what causes these deaths after transplants over a long time since the procedure? Do the recipients somehow reject and attack the donated marrow? Does the new marrow eventually fail? But the recipient's immune system was destroyed, why can't the received marrow/immune system exist indefinitely, or a repeat/follow-up transplant procedure performed further down the line?

A follow-up question I have is are there grounds for marrow transplants to be used to treat immunodeficiency disorders such as CVID? I also read that some investigation has been performed into treating MS with bone marrow transplantation.

This is a long one, thanks in advance!

This made me wonder if people with aphantasia experience things like depression at all, in lower numbers, or if they simply experience it differently. Surely if you have no voice in your head to telling you you're worthless then you must be free from the negative feelings it causes. I would also think the the same would apply to various other mental disorders.  
Is there any correlation between having aphantasia (or not) and susceptibility to mental illness?

Text: I've always heard that pregnancy over ages 35 (often called  Advanced Maternal Age) is significantly more dangerous for both the woman and the baby, due to the higher risks of miscarriages, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes and decrease in fertility rates (as said [here](https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/geriatric-pregnancy), [here](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317861) and [here](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22438-advanced-maternal-age), for example). But, I watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9ryP0UyO5U), from &quot;Adam Ruins Everything&quot;, which provides evidence that the risks of getting pregnant between the ages of 35 and 40 don't increase as much as warned by the majority of doctors.

So, what's the truth about pregnancy after 35? If women could have babies until they were 40 without taking any more risks, it would be better to their careers.

Text: Not sure if I worded the title correctly, but I was wondering how antibodies and resistance to Covid works. Take, for instance, my experience with the virus…

* I was vaccinated in August 2021.
* I was infected by Covid-19 in October 2021. No hospital visit or monoclonal treatment required.
* Antibodies are said to be good for 90 days. 
* I chose not to get any boosters. 
* I have not been as “safe” as one could be, and have been in largely unmasked crowds on occasion. I have been to stores, out with friends, on vacation, etc. — always following Covid guidelines, but when given the option not to mask up, I have chosen not to. 
* Luckily, to my knowledge, I have not been infected by Covid-19 a second time. 

If your body produces antibodies after infection, is it possible that continued exposure to Covid would ensure your body continues to produce antibodies?

Why would continual exposure to Covid *not* act similarly to a booster?

Text: The first JWST image is said to be the deepest infrared image of the universe ever observed, featuring galaxies billions of light years away. But would it make sense to point the JWST at a relatively nearby object like Pluto, or Proxima Centauri, and generate the most detailed images of these objects ever recorded?

Text: Wildfires in many regions are becoming more frequent and more severe. Most of the headlines focus on the short and long-term impacts these disasters have on plants, animals and the economy. But what's going on underground? Research is just beginning to demonstrate the impacts disturbances to microbial communities can have on soil composition, plant behavior and human health.

Join us today at 2 PM ET (19UT) for an AMA, organized by the American Society for Microbiology, focused on the impact wildfires are having on microbial communities. We will take questions about experimental approaches being taken to study this issue, share insight into how the increased frequency and severity of fires is affecting ecosystems at the micro and macro levels, and discuss strategies for managing fire-affected ecosystems under changing fire regimes.
Ask us anything!

If so, then.... here's what I don't quite get. Why did the scientists/statisticians package the information based on the 5-year timeline? I'm not quite sure what is so significant about the &quot;5-year&quot; part. Hmm why didn't they tell us about the survival rate in the first 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, etc. years instead? Is it perhaps because the '50%' statistic is a catchy/sexy number? I don't think it is catchy at all, because I don't see it as being objectively more significant than 40%, 60%, or any other percent for that matter.

Please someone, help me understand the importance of such statements if they are in fact important. I fail to see anything important about them at all.

Text: I was taught that mountain ranges create dryer environments on the side facing away from the prevailing winds and wetter environments on the side facing towards it. In most cases, this holds true. Cascades, Sierra Nevada, Madagascar, NZ South Island, etc. The Andes is an almost perfect example of this because the locations of the dryer and wetter environments switch as the prevailing winds change wrt latitude.

However, there seems to be some cases in which the rain shadow seems to be inverted. For example, in southern India, there is the Western Ghats mountain range. The prevailing winds at this latitude blow from northeast to southwest, which would should mean that the eastern side is wetter than the western side of the range. However, it's the opposite that's true. The western side of this mountain range is wetter than the eastern side. This is hardly the only example of this, you see this same sort of thing if you look at western Mexico or Turkey's Black Sea coast. 

Why does the rain shadow seem to be on the wrong side in some situations?

Text: Genetic testing for Tay-Sachs begin in the 70s.

Since then [the incidence of Tay-Sachs has fallen by more than 90 percent among Jews, thanks to a combination of scientific advances and volunteer community activism that brought screening for the disease into synagogues, Jewish community centers and, eventually, routine medical care.](https://www.timesofisrael.com/how-jewish-activism-has-wiped-out-tay-sachs/#:~:text=Since%20the%20'70s%2C%20the%20incidence,%2C%20eventually%2C%20routine%20medical%20care.)

[Until 1969, when doctors discovered the enzyme that made testing possible to determine whether parents were carriers of Tay-Sachs, 50 to 60 affected Jewish children were born each year in the United States and Canada. After mass screenings began in 1971, the numbers declined to two to five Jewish births a year, said Karen Zeiger, whose first child died of Tay-Sachs.](https://www.timesofisrael.com/how-jewish-activism-has-wiped-out-tay-sachs/#:~:text=Since%20the%20'70s%2C%20the%20incidence,%2C%20eventually%2C%20routine%20medical%20care.)

[Tay–Sachs disease is a genetic disorder that results in the destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.[1] The most common form is infantile Tay–Sachs disease, which becomes apparent around three to six months of age, with the baby losing the ability to turn over, sit, or crawl.[1] This is then followed by seizures, hearing loss, and inability to move, with death usually occurring by the age of three to five.[3][1] Less commonly, the disease may occur in later childhood or adulthood (juvenile or late-onset).[1] These forms tend to be less severe,[1] but the juvenile form typically results in death by age 15.](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease)

[Tay–Sachs disease is caused by a genetic mutation in the HEXA gene on chromosome 15, which codes for a subunit of the hexosaminidase enzyme known as hexosaminidase A. It is inherited from a person's parents in an autosomal recessive manner.](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease)

[Three main approaches have been used to prevent or reduce the incidence of Tay–Sachs:](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease&amp;section=8)

+ [Prenatal diagnosis. If both parents are identified as carriers, prenatal genetic testing can determine whether the fetus has inherited a defective gene copy from both parents.[30] Chorionic villus sampling (CVS), the most common form of prenatal diagnosis, can be performed between 10 and 14 weeks of gestation. Amniocentesis is usually performed at 15–18 weeks. These procedures have risks of miscarriage of 1% or less.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease&amp;section=8)
+ [Preimplantation genetic diagnosis. By retrieving the mother's eggs for in vitro fertilization, it is possible to test the embryo for the disorder prior to implantation. Healthy embryos are then selected and transferred into the mother's womb, while unhealthy embryos are discarded. In addition to Tay–Sachs disease, preimplantation genetic diagnosis has been used to prevent cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia among other genetic disorders.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease&amp;section=8)
+ [Mate selection. In Orthodox Jewish circles, the organization Dor Yeshorim carries out an anonymous screening program so that carriers for Tay–Sachs and other genetic disorders can avoid marrying each other.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease&amp;section=8)

Each of the mechanisms above would work to eliminate embryos with two Tay-Sachs genes, and preimplantation genetic diagnoses could be used to eliminate embryos with one Tay-Sachs gene, though I have no reason to think it is used that way.

By eliminating embryos with two Tay-Sachs genes, adults (who could reproduce) with Tay-Sachs are also eliminated and so I would think that over time, the genetic frequency of the Tay-Sachs disorder would decline.

Is there any evidence of this for Tay-Sachs?

Has the gene frequency of any recessive genetic disorder been reduced through screening mechanisms?

Text: I was wondering what happens with mineral oil and gas deposits once their “host“ tectonic plates undergo subduction.

Would you get large underground fires and explosions, or would the high pressure in the subduction zone prevent those? If the deposits burn violently, how much would that even be detectable on the surface (given our current seismometers and similar measuring devices)?

I have seen answers that CWD can last for 2 years or longer but that answer seems to come from 10+ years ago, there surely must be new findings?

Text: I just read about 'corn sweat' for the first time and, y'all, my mind was blown and replaced with sooo many questions. The articles and links that pop up when googled all state sweat from corn, and like plants, can increase humidity in an area making humid areas more so (as in the American Midwest). If this is true, then can we assume it also applies to non humid areas? If it does, then, basically, my main question is the one from the title- Would planting corn in arid regions increase the likelihood of rain/precipitation?

But my question is will their body temperature be identical to their surroundings or will it be warmer?

Title: how does fat and protein digestion works? difference between lean and fatty protein and the effect on digestion time?

Text:  Hello altogether,

unfortunately I have many different questions about all things fat and protein digestion, specifically regarding animal products with different fat content.

I want to understand the science and the chemistry behind the whole topic and also educate myself even further because it seems like I know nothing.

I tried to do some „research“ and found several different claims, opinions and explanations.

Before I get into the questions, I want to present the claims from the two different „camps“ because obviously there are more schools of thought?!

**Team fatty meat/protein:**

*The more fat that is in the protein the more delayed is digestion and therefore it sits in the small intestine longer and the required enzymes have more time to do their work and help digest the protein and the fat more efficiently, fully and easier! If the protein is leaner it goes to the digestive tract much faster, probably undigested and not fully absorbed by the small intestine.*

*Muscle meats like chicken breast or lean steak can aggravate constipation and therefore its beneficial to replace them with gelatinous meats instead and cuts with more soft tissue like chicken thighs, fatty meats etc. Humans can only use meat fibers properly when they come with fat, collagen and other substances.*

*Dark meat like chicken thighs or fatty cuts of meat contain more nutrients like zinc, iron and more vitamins like b12 additional folate, pantothenic acid, selenium, phosphorous, and vitamins K and A which aids in digestion.*

**Team lean meat/protein:**

*Meats with higher fat content take longer to digest. Also, foods with the least amount of fat, least amount connective tissues, and shorter muscle fibers are easier to digest. It means that fish is the easiest meat to digest, then poultry, pork and lastly beef*

*it also means that if the piece of chicken or turkey you are eating has more fat or long muscle fibers (thighs or drumsticks) than a LEAN piece of steak or a LEAN cut of pork, then that piece of chicken will be harder to digest!*

*A piece of boneless skinless chicken breast is easier to digest than a chicken thigh. Lean ground beef (93/7) is easier to digest than fattier ground beef (80/20) and a lean filet is easier to digest than a ribeye or beef brisket, chick etc.*

Ok, so far so good and I’m confused.

What I found is a study about myoglobin and it seems like that dark meat or cuts of poultry and beef with more myoglobin and more connective tissue are „harder“ to digest than white meat or poultry/beef with less myoglobin!?

**My questions are:**

What sits longer in the stomach, how long and why?

What sits longer in the small intestine, how long and why?

What kind of poultry/meat moves faster through the digestive tract, especially through the small intestine?

Which cuts require more effort, more enzymes, more stomach acid?

Which cuts are more taxing on the liver?

Is it easier and quicker for the small intestine to absorb nutrients from lean or fatty protein and why?

which factor determines whether a piece of animal protein/fat is light or heavy, fast or slow digesting when looking at the fat/food in isolation. Is it the fat content, connective tissue, a combination?

Is a fatty ribeye or hamburger patty (70/30 or 80/20) easier to digest than a lean filet steak? Or a fatty chicken thigh easier than a chicken breast? Pretend that all meats/beef/poultry are cooked to a moist internal temperature, not overcooked, tough or dry

Are low fat dairy products easier and quicker to digest than full fat dairy products?

At the end of the day I want to know which cuts of poultry/meat/beef/fish are easier to digest for the stomach and small intestine and which cuts are moving faster through the digestive tract. Also from which cuts the small intestine can easier absorb nutrients?

Im looking for a evidence based scientific answers in plain English that I can understand what’s going on and why. I don’t need study’s, although it would be nice, but everything backed up with science based explanations and evidence not opinions or preferences like almost everything on YouTube, food blogs etc. I’m looking for people who study this stuff or work in this field and know what they talking about.

Im very thankful for every explanation, help and for everyone who reads this.

I appreciate every Tipp where and how I can educate myself because I don’t want to be lazy.

Thank you very much and have a great day

Text: **Please read this entire post carefully and format your application appropriately.**

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/s93rpe/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxvi/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).
* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)
* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)
* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?
* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

\-------------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

`Username: /u/foretopsail`

`General field: Anthropology`

`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`

`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`

`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`

`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

Are there any data indicating that, e.g. &quot;population group X experienced economic difficulties in the year Y, which was reflected in a statistically detectable deviation/anomaly in the distribution for height for the group some N years later, compared to how it is normally&quot;

But that doesn't make the intensities at other wavelengths zero... They are there, non zero but small... I suspect they appear due to scattering from no so tightly bounded electrons. 

But my question is why should they be so low? Like why is the concentration of free electron scattering and tight electron scattering so high compared to the rest(the no so tight electron scattering)...?

I am just confused how tartaric acid is diprotic since it contains four hydroxides in its molecular structure; does this mean that only two of its hydroxides are reactive?  Maybe it means that after two protons have been donated, the structure changes to where it is no longer able to donate protons?  Any insight is appreciated, thank you.

However, there are some arguing that this experiment is flawed since the cup of water creates a vacuum which is the cause of the longer soak time.

Thoughts ?

Why don't we just do routine full-body scans of everyone.. every year?

You would think insurance companies would be on board with paying for it.. because think of all the tens/ hundreds of thousands of dollars that could be saved years down the line trying to save your life once disease is &quot;too far gone&quot;

What I'd like to understand is how the rail infrastructure in places that do experience extreme sides of weather is able to withstand the extremes. In my head I'm thinking of cities in North America on the east coast which experience very low and very high temperatures. How does their rail infrastructure cope with extremes? How are they built differently?

Text: In trying to research potential treatments for glioblastoma, I came across cannabinoids.  It seems like they all fight cancer (glioblastoma specifically) and could inevitably some day cure people's cancers.  There have been hundreds of studies, but as near as I can tell there has never once been a single study that tested these in live humans, without being administered in combination with chemo and radiation.  I heard a long time ago that they will never ever do that because if a person dies then someone gets blamed for not using chemo and radiation.  That kind of logic seems designed to forever prevent there from being any kind of cure or alternative to chemo and radiation, ever.

Do they ever do any in vivo studies on any (new or existing) cancer drugs that are not designed to see if the drug can &quot;assist&quot; chemo and radiation?  If not, is there any &quot;path forward&quot; for anyone to ever develop a drug that actually cures cancer?

But I've noticed that other cultures also have a Paleo-Neo differentiation of their epochs. 

Also, terms like &quot;Bronze/Iron Age&quot; doesn't apply to other parts of the world, and moreover, some cultures don't even have Tin and/or Copper (two ingredients for bronze).

Text: Hi reddit,

after my last question I read a bit more about materials in tech, and it's absolutely fascinating. I thought it was all just plastic and silicon, but there is a whole world of strange stuff out there.

I wanted to know what you can find in a phone and found those two cool papers:

    https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11664-014-3310-3
    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5940856/

They both ground down phones and analyzed their content. One thing was strange: Most things are somehow consistent over different phones (with some like lead becoming way less after RoHS in 2006, makes sense), but one is really strange: thallium.

In the second paper, it is found in some phones in the range of 20-300 mg/kg phone, but in most phones it does not appear at all. Same for the first paper: It is found in only 4 of the over 80 phones, with contents between 4-80 mg/kg phone. I could assume that they just did not find it even if it was there in the second case, but it does not sound correct to assume that if in the first paper they only found it very few of thos over 80 phones. I found many speicalized applications, but solar panels and medical equipment don't sound like phones. I also found a combination where it was used for wireless communications, but I can't find info on this in phones, so maybe that is more some kind base station material? Also if it is used as a dopant in semiconductors its concentration would be much much lower than it is in the phones where it was found. Since on this subreddit there seems to be someone knowledgable for every topic:

Where and how is thallium used in phones and in tech general? Is it in some chip on the PCB, in the display or somewhere else, which function does it have and why is it only found in some of them?

PS: The flair is hard, others could also fit...

Text: For example, cream cheese frosting. It’s just a 1:1:1 ratio of cream cheese, butter and sugar, all of which are essentially solids at refrigerator temperature. However, when combined, the resulting frosting at refrigerator temperature is free-flowing and has the viscosity of lukewarm honey. The only explanation I can think of is the milkfat or sugar destabilizing the protein matrix of the cheese.

Text: So often people talk about what animals are closest to us (chimps, monkeys, etc) but I've never really heard of someone talking about the most unrelated animal to us. So, in terms of what would be commonly referred to as an animal in every-day talk (so no single-celled organisms or things like that), what is furthest from us?

Edit: For clarity, by &quot;animal in every-day talk&quot; I just mean no single celled organisms, bacteria, etc. Things that are just so obviously far from us because they're so simple. Things like insects, sponges, etc all count. I eliminate them simply because while most likely correct, it's just not an interesting answer, and most people not in the scientific field wouldn't consider a bacteria to even be an animal in any way. For the sake of what discussion can be drawn from this, I want more interesting answers than the very obvious.

2. The latex barrier is 100% effective, but 20% of the time it breaks/slips, etc.
3. The latex barrier is 80% effective -- 20% of the time, HIV goes straight through the latex.

Text: So today I wanted to pour the hot coffee from the coffee machine I had just made into a standard water glass so that it can cool down for an ice coffee. My partner saw this and shouted &quot;don't pour it in there, the glass is gonna explode!&quot;. 

Apparently, their parents had taught them that if you pour hot liquid into a glass, it will explode, and to always use appropriate kitchen equipment (ceramic cups in this case). I had never heard of this before. We discussed this notion and did some googling and it seems that if you pour liquid with a large temperature difference to the glass into it, it can indeed make it fracture. So now we're wondering: 

1. Why does a rapid temperature change make glass fracture?

2. Can glass actually explode if the temperature difference is large enough? (e.g. taking a glass out of the freezer and pouring boiling hot liquid into it)

Thanks in advance and Cheers

Text: I was reading from here, in the literature:

&quot; Also in 2014, Waldinger et al. offered the first evidence that the genital anesthesia in PSSD may involve a peripheral component \[[33](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6004927/#ref033)\]. A 43-year-old male developed penile anesthesia and scrotum hypesthesia on paroxetine which persisted after stopping the drug. He had attempted to assess the level of insensitivity by applying Tiger Balm to his penis, but felt nothing except a vague sensation over his scrotum. A small degree of tactile sensitivity was regained following treatment with low-power laser irradiation, though there was no improvement in sexual responsiveness. It was hypothesized that SSRIs may disrupt the normal functioning of transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels. &quot;

&amp;#x200B;

By what mechanisms can this happen? Penile anasthesia seems to be a disruption in the ionic channels, but how can this persist even when one is not taking the drug.

Is there a larger clade that forms *all* vascular plants, or am I thinking about this too hard and that's not how it works? From my studies I've also found that some websites just use clades to substitute other taxonomic ranks such as phylum and class.

As a follow-up, if they are relicts of independent organisms, do they have their own specific genetic lineages?

Is this just a quirk of these particular languages or is it something more universal about in human belief to connect the heart organ with emotional functions?

Text: I think we all know what graphene is, and it's cheap production. 

During my time finding graphene online, I also found out that it can be manufactured into fibers. And an idea went up in my head: *&quot;What if I use graphene fiber, instead of carbon fiber?&quot;*. After all, it's more better in a lot ways than carbon fiber, especially in cost. Like, you can make your own graphene at home-type cheap. 

BAC motors made a sports car that has graphene body panels, probably using graphene in its' fiber form, that's what I think is most likely how they used it. I read an article about it, but the article didn't say how the graphene became as applicable as carbon fiber, like how BAC used carbon fiber. 

Does graphene fiber need to be impregnated with resin, like carbon fiber? Or no, it doesn't need to be impregnated with resin?

Text: I'm into organizing, and plastic containers, storage boxes, and trays are the most commonly available items for that. I've recently become aware of the dangers of BPA (Bisphenol A), as well as BPS (Bisphenol S) (which is not flagged equally but considered just as dangerous) as endocrine disruptors and carcinogens. I've learned that it is strongly recommended to replace plastic when it comes to food containers. However, I have a few questions about the use of plastics in every day life that I have found opposing answers for when searching and I'd appreciate your take on:

1. Are plastic containers relatively safe (with or without BPA) as long as they're not used to heat up food? Is not using them for storing food in the fridge or at room temperature still highly recommended or are the risks exaggerated?
2. Do plastic containers/trays/storage bins (with or without BPA) for clothes, personal items, and paper pose similar risks? Should plastic be avoided to store and organize items in desks, closets, shelfs, etc, too?
3. Do the risks of doing 1 and 2 increase for a person with actual hormone problems?

Text: I watched a Physics 2 final review video before my class starts this semester to get a look at what I’ll learn this year and while taking notes I saw that the diffraction grating equation was d*sin(θ) =  m*λ which was very similar to the Bragg’s Law equation I learned in chemistry last year: 2d*sin(θ) = n*λ.

I watched a khan academy video on the double slit equation formula and understood it as a very good approximation allowed when the d is very small and the distance of the screen is relatively far away.  

If in any way these equations can be related, I’d Bragg’s law also an approximation.

I know these deal with different things but I I noticed they were similar and thought maybe by chance there might be some commonality.

Is the CO2 in those productions, added to Chinas total CO2 emissions. In my reasoning, if I, who live in Sweden, buy a car from China, the CO2 emissions from producing that car should be added to Swedens total CO2, and not Chinas. Is this how these things are usually calculated?

I have done some research into tectonic plates in an attempt to create a realistic fantasy world, but I seem to be confusing myself.

People talk about oceanic plates and continental plates, but looking at tectonic plates maps show that most tectonic plates have both conitental and oceanic crust.

Is the idea of them being separate plates a lie? Are they just kind of random and could have been anywhere? Also, do tectonic plates changed direction over time? Are there any good sources of information for this?

I will also have to teach this to 10 year olds at some point, so anything geared towards that age that answers my questions would be great, but not necessary.

We have asked our health and safety and one just ignored the question whilst the other said it was just what happens to it when exposed. By it turning red just sat away from acid does that mean ventilation is shit and we're all just breathing in acid?

Text: Okay, maybe this is a stupid question but yesterday I was chatting with my sister and she brought up one of her patient's parrot and how he greets everyone, sings lyrical and even says goodnight. She actually told me she was scared at first because the first time she entered his house, she greeted the patient (Hello [name]) and she heard this robotic like voice saying &quot;Oh [patient's name] who is this?&quot;

And then the question came up. How do they talk almost like us if they have a totally different mouth? We change sounds based on our tongue and lips, but they have a beak, yet they can still sound *almost* human!

Thanks to anyone who might respond. :)

Text: As I understand, when two particles are entangled, the change in the state in one of the particles is automatically sent to the other entangled particle instantly (at speeds even higher than the speed of light).  I see that scientists try to entangle even objects (do they somehow entangle each particle of that object?), if one of the particles is destroyed, does the second one also get destroyed automatically?

In the book of 2021, 

&gt; Bats have eyes, they can actually see very well with it. 

(Translated by me, very poorly.) 

Which ones correct?

I’ve never really understood clouds and the way they are visible despite being small individual vapor and dust particles in the atmosphere, and it is counter intuitive to me that clouds don’t disappear.

Text:  

If we have a population of normal and cancer cells, and we give a drug to this population. And lets say this drug induces apoptosis. Usually, the drug would have a detrimental effects on the cancerous cells, but would pretty much cause the normal cells to be unaffected. How is that? If the drug can induce cell death in both normal and cancerous cells, why do the cancerous cells tend to die first? Is it because cancerous cells are way better at metabolism than non-cancerous cells, and so they suck everything from their environment; Therefore the normal cells get a small quantity of the drug, while the cancerous cells consume most of it and hence die?

(I know that some drugs might target  molecules that are unique to cancerous cells. However for the ones that are non-specific, how do these drugs manage to destroy our cancerous cells pretty well, while sort of not over-harming our normal cells)

Text: My understanding of math/physics is formally at an undergraduate level, so I apologize in advance if my questions are confusing or not very well formulated.

I've watched some videos about the holographic principle and how it was the attempts to solve the so-called black hole information paradox that lead to the development of string theories and the holographic principle. Ultimately this culminates in the correspondence between Anti-de Sitter spaces (a model of the universe under general relativity) and conformal field theories (i.e., quantum field theories). In the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klpDHn8viX8), the presenter tells us two things: 1.) That this correspondence leads to a &quot;natural&quot; theory of quantum gravity, and 2.) that interactions (between quantum particles?) on the boundary of the mathematical object's surface correspond to the emergence of gravity within the volume. However, he tells us that this isn't applicable to *our* universe, because anti-de Sitter spaces assume a negative curvature on the space-time metric, while as far as I understand, in reality it is zero (i.e., a Minkowski space-time).

So my questions are twofold: what quantum information is the problem here, and in need of conservation; are they things like spins and energies, and why does this lead to the holographic principle? Secondly, what is being said about the actual physics going on between quantum field theories and gravity with regards to this strange mathematical object?

Text: There are multiple arcs of light spreading from many of the galaxies shown in the deep field image from the James Webb Telescope. From googling I'm understanding that these arcs are generally the result of gravitational lensing caused by a mass outside the focus of the image. My specific question stems from the multiple arcs that aren't concentric.

I've worked to the perhaps invalid understanding that each non-concentric arc must represent a different lense (gravitational mass) How is a single perspective (the telescope) able to focus the light from multiple lenses at once?

I'm imagining that it's possible that we and chimpanzees share some junk DNA that's been hanging out since our ancestors diverged a relatively short time ago. Is this true?

Thanks.

Text: When magma oozes up from the mantle at divergent plate boundaries or from hot spots like Hawaii, they form &quot;oceanic plate material&quot; that's low in silicates.

Then that stuff gets subducted under continental plates where it melts and bubbles back up but now when that lava comes out it forms high silicate &quot;continental plate material&quot;.

But why? Where did the first cratons come from and why does continental plate material ever form? Why isn't it all oceanic plate material?

Text: I understand the magnetic and electric fields are related, but from what I understand magnetic-only and electric-only fields can also be generated. I want to understand what kind of force these fields exert on magnetized and/or charged particles.

We have the Lorentz force: F =qE + (qv x B), but my confusion with this equation is that it takes into account only the charge, so, if the net charge is 0, then there is no force applied. Then, what about a particle that is not charged, but still has a magnetic dipole? Is there a general equation like Lorentz force to understnand such systems? I tried to look into magnetic dipoles and torques, but I am confused.

In the questions below, magnetic objects can be considered as objects having a magnetic dipole. So my question is, 

*What is the force exerted by ...*

1. an **electric field** on a charged, non-magnetic object?

The charged particle will follow the electric field lines (F=qE).

2. an **electric field** on a neutral, magnetic object?

As it is neutral, we have, q=0, so there is no force applied.

3. a **magnetic field** on a charged, non-magnetic object?

If it has velocity, it will have the result of a cross-product q(vxB), so the force will change the direction of the movement (right hand rule), but if the velocity is 0, then there is no force applied.

4. a **magnetic field** on a neutral, magnetic object?
So, according to equation, we never take this interaction into account. But, magnets do align themselves to magnetic fields, correct? Then, how so?

Are the conclusions correct? I am especially confused about 4.

Text: White paint is commonly used on aircraft for practical and economic reasons - it's easier to resell a white plane that can be painted with the buyer's livery, its easier to spot leaks, the plane heats up less while sitting on the tarmac and most importantly, white paint will not fade or flake as quickly as other colours since it reflects light rather than absorbing it.

However this got me thinking, is there any strong evidence that the reflective nature of white paint used on airliners helps combat exposure to UV-A, B or ionizing radiation for the occupants?

Text: Consider the potential due to a pure dipole... It's 
V=k(p.r)/|r|^3 ... where r is position vector of the point at which the potential is considered and p is dipole moment of the charge distribution... 

Because the net charge Q=0, p remains the same even if we shift the origin... Now consider shifting the origin such that |r| remains the same but r doesn't so that p.r has a different value now... Therefore V has a different value in this frame...

Why? Isn't the potential at a point just the potential difference between this point and a chosen reference point(which happens to be infinity in this case) which shouldn't change unless you change the reference point itself? 

Any explanation???

So, is there some lower-density fluid that, on the moon, I could swim in and have much the same experience as swimming in water on earth?

And same for a high-g planet, could I swim in something heavier and have much the same experience (though I suppose the weight of my organs etc pushing on one another wouldn't change - I'd still feel the same *inside*)?

Text: I understand that in an isolated system entropy tends to increase, but I’m having trouble picturing what an increase in entropy of a space rock would look like. Is a space rock constantly losing molecules on its surface as time goes on, and eventually there’s no rock left and the molecules also break down? How would the bonds holding the surface molecules to the interior break apart in a vacuum? A rock in a vacuum seems so permanent from my perspective but I know surprising things happen over huge timeframes. 

Thanks a lot for reading.
