Text: I was recently discussing how hard it is to retrofit online multiplayer onto classic arcade games, as they expected the other players input to be right there on a wire plugged into the PCB. However one earlier solution to this was used by the [XBAND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XBAND) service, where each user would run the game locally, but with lock-step inputs of their own controller and the remote player, who was dialled directly into your XBAND adapter.

My real question is, what would have been the latency of such a direct call? Assuming two users in urban environments, say one in San Francisco and one in Los Angeles. Every resource I can find talks about general internet latency in the dial-up era, but that involves routing and multiple machines, or talks about modern cell-phone calls, which have a more complex set-up and teardown. You're directly dialled into someone else, it's a voice call, what's the latency on that?

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for 'X' were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;.

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

For example: yes, having impaired vision would impact someone’s ability to process visual information, like physical perception or reading, but does whatever additional cognitive effort given to overcoming the impaired vision take away from cognitive ability of other tasks, like critical thinking, problem solving, mood stability, social skills, etc? And if so, would those deficiency even out once, in this example, corrective lenses are used?

Text: Taking bananas as an example, a freckled banana tastes significantly sweeter than a green one. I assume there’s an actual higher sugar content in a more ripe banana? Does this change the nutritional profile of the banana in any significant way? Or does it still fall into the general range of “bananas have about this much sugar?”

Are there other less obvious ways that the nutritional content of fruits (or vegetables) change at various stages of ripeness?

Text: As far as I know, cancer appears when random cells in your body mutate and refuse to die, then multiplying into other cancerous cells, and so on until they invade the nearby tissues.

Any damage to cells may increase the risk of cancer because with every cell division, there is a risk of an error that can give birth to a cancerous cells. More division, greater chances of errors.

Giving blood depletes the body of a insane amount of cells, cells that need to be replaced by the body via division. Does this increase the risk of a error occuring during the division that could give birth to a cancerous cell?

Stranger still, is the fact that objects which have been contaminated, somehow &quot;lose&quot; radiation stuck to them over time! Yes, I read somewhere about half-life of elements and whatnot, but what does a half-life of uranium-238 for example, have to do with the radiation that it gave off which in turn stuck to something? Radiation is not the element itself, it is energy, so how can it &quot;decay&quot; like the element that originated it?

One of the sources I'm considering is contaminated agar, as the rhizomorphic mycelium I use now started from a culture that had contamination in one area.

From what I've read, it looks like this bacterium spreads via wet surfaces by swimming, or the spores fly through the air. I also suspect contamination through the air, as the innoculation wasn't in a flow hood.

Is it possible that B. Subtilis can dig into and embed itself in solidifed agar, or is it more likely that the airborne spores got into my grains?

Text: Suppose a patient is given the treatment for rabies after getting bitten and then gets cured after a while. Are there any chances the infection might still stay active somewhere in the body for years? 

Are the booster doses needed? Is there any scenario where the cured person still has a possibility to get infected after many years from the past supposedly cured infection if booster shot isn't taken?

Can the infection stay passive in the patient even after the treatment? 

There's a lot of conflicting information out there. I would appreciate some explanation on this.

&gt; - False-positive [...] influenza test results are more likely to occur when disease prevalence is low

&gt; - False-negative [...] influenza test results are more likely to occur when disease prevalence is high

&amp;nbsp;

Why is this the case if the tests may have been manufactured before the start of the season?

Does the quantity of positive results in a given time period impact assay interference?

Text:  

Greetings! I am relatively new to Chemistry and the natural sciences overall, and have a question regarding molecules vs ions.

To   my understanding, molecules are always neutral as they are not the   compound of two charged atoms (+ or -), but rather the fusion of two   neutral atoms. Ions, however, are the other way around, and the more   ions you add (polyatomic ions), it will flip between being neutral or   charged. But, how then, can water (H2O) be dipolar? Perhaps I have   understood the concept of polarity wrong. If the molecules are neutral   as neither the Hydrogen or Oxygen atoms are charged, how can the   water-molecule have two sides? Or is it for this very reason that it has   two sides, simply because it is the fusion of two neutral atoms?

On  a  similar topic, I must also ask the difference between ionic bonding  and  molecular formation ... The ions, of course, attract other charged   atoms (other ions), because the valence-electrons wish to jump over to   differently charged ions since atoms strive to have a full outer shell.   But, molecules do not do this, do they? How are they different? Are  they  simply the combination of two atoms, in which the electrons do not   leave their respective atoms, but rather join together in an &quot;orbital   fusion&quot; in which they can travel freely (until broken up)? This would   make sense since they are not charged, and therefore have no attraction   to leave their own atoms for opposing ones.

I am very thankful for answers! Good day :)

My goal is to communicate scientific discoveries and breakthroughs to a wide audience through fun and visually engaging videos. During the pandemic, I used my communication channels to help try to stop the spread of misinformation, sending out daily infographics and updates to followers. I have delivered 4 TEDx talks where I discussed how to cure cancer using embryonic therapy, how can we change education now, how to make science fascinating to the general public, and how science-based decision can change the world.

In [June](https://interestingengineering.com/transportation/nuclear-powered-flying-hotel) and [October 2022](https://interestingengineering.com/culture/megastructure-orbital-ring-around-earth-film) my work was featured in Interesting Engineering, and the publication has helped organize this AMA session. I'll be available between 1 and 6 PM (Berlin time, 7-12 ET, 12-17 UT), AMA!

Text: Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for 'X' were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;.

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed.

Text: Hello all, after my MSc in Integrated Product Design at the University of Pennsylvania and a year stint in industry designing pick-and-place robots, I started working as a Ph.D. researcher (Mechanical Engineering) at Hod Lipson's (He co-launched the world's first open-source 3D printer which could be used for food) Creative Machines Lab where I tinker with digital cooking techniques using food printers and lasers. We've experimented with dough, meats, vegetables, sweets, made a seven-ingredient slice of cheesecake, and printed chicken samples which were then cooked by lasers. Currently, we are focusing on building robust software and hardware to incorporate more functionality to print food of different consistencies and multi-ingredient combinations to fully showcase this tech's potential.

In August 2022, my work was featured in Interesting Engineering, and the publication helped organize this AMA session. Ask me anything about the technology behind 3D-printed food, the how-tos on printing food, how lasers can cook food, how 3D-printed food can be inventive, nutritious, and customized for each individual.

I will be replying to messages with the username &quot;IntEngineering&quot; at noon ET (17 UT), AMA!

Text: For example, if a group of participants have always been praised as good-looking, and I say the same to them again, will that reduce the effectiveness of the praise because they've heard it too much? Contrasting, if a group of participants have a history of being viewed as ugly by others, and I now say that they are beautiful, would they be exceptionally confident because they have never heard it before, or will they be more insecure because they could not believe that? I have had the help from the panelists to introduce the article The Praise Paradox by Eddie Brummelman, where it is said that keeping telling people they are intelligent or beautiful might put pressure on them to keep smart. But I would also like to know more about comparing the effect of drastic change of praises with continuing giving the same praise.

Text: **What are you doing to get clean air?**

As the fear of airborne illnesses has heightened, people have understandably become much more concerned about potentially contagious strangers and are choosing to go where high air quality standards are maintained. Conventional approaches have been focused on making filters tighter, but filter media can only be made so small before becoming difficult to move air effectively or efficiently. Reducing nanoparticles by agglomerating them into larger, aggregated clusters is the key. Larger particles are more easily mitigated and fall to the ground more quickly. [Atmofizer](https://atmofizer.com/) is leading 4th generation in air technology, with patented agglomeration tech using acoustic pressure waves to reduce airborne nanoscopic particles-without using filters and saving our landfills! Another benefit we hear is the reduction of odors, including strong smoke odors like cannabis. Cleaner air apparently smells a lot better too!

We are the scientists behind Atmofizer, ask us anything!

Is there an inverse relationship - are organisms at higher altitudes/lower pressure environments/higher oxygen environments/warmer environments smaller?

Text: A while ago I noticed how the color of objects gets progressively darker the dimmer the light source is, up until everything looking completely black if there's none, at least to our eyes. And then i also realized this happens the same the other way around, as if the light source is bright enough, it can make objects look completely white.   


And this effect is a spectrum, you can make an object go from black to white by going from no light source to a really strong one. So then, how can we really determine the *true* color of things? or if there even is one? a &quot;red&quot; jacket can go from a bordeaux color in dim light to a more crimson tone in brighter light, what color is the jacket, objectively?

Text: Let's say an astronomer notices something worth studying out there.... How do they tell other astronomers around the world, or just record exactly where they are looking at? For instance for coordinates on Earth they'd give a lat/long and that would always be the same place.

&amp;#x200B;

But in space, everything is in motion and therefore relative to the observer.  The earth is moving in space, and rotating as is whatever object is being studied.    So on any given day, or even time, the object being studying is not going to be in the same 'relative' space as it was yesterday, etc....

&amp;#x200B;

So how are coordinates marked for collaboration or future study?

Text: I've been thinking about this for awhile but I couldn't find many resources about it online. My reasoning is: every human has certain dimensions/proportions (let's say an IPD of 63-66mm); some of them are in the &quot;ideal&quot; range, whereas others are under (IPD=60mm) or over (IPD=71mm) it. However, if we took the average of all humans for each feature, the people who are over and people who are under would cancel out and the end result for average human (or maybe average male and average female separately) would fit all the ideal metrics. This is kind of similar reasoning to &quot;Wisdom of the Crowd&quot; (see: [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom\_of\_the\_crowd](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd)) phenomenon, but rather than a crowd's intellect, it's a crowd's (species') physical attractiveness.

One resource I did manage to find was this:

[https://www.artfido.com/this-is-what-the-average-person-looks-like-in-each-country/](https://www.artfido.com/this-is-what-the-average-person-looks-like-in-each-country/)

This is very nearly what I am going for, just couldn't find one for the entire earth. I am also not sure how accurate that website is. But, assuming it is accurate, you'll notice all the faces (male &amp; female) are all very good looking and far more attractive than what you'd probably consider &quot;average&quot;. This is a result of the &quot;cancelling of error&quot; that I mentioned above.

Text: Hello /r/AskScience! Dinosaur mummies preserve skin and other soft tissues, but how they fossilize has always been a bit of a quandry. It's generally thought that very rapid burial is required to protect remains from predators, scavengers, and other agents of decomposition. However, they often also appear desiccated, which usually takes long-term exposure on the landscape.

Recent preparation on the Edmontosaurus mummy &quot;Dakota&quot; revealed the first evidence of predator activity on dinosaurian soft tissues and provided an alternate explanation for how these rare fossils form. You can read [our recent publication](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0275240) in PLOS One.

**Ask us your questions about Dakota the Dinomummy, how fossils are formed and what goes into fossil preparation!**

Joining us today are:

**Stephanie Drumheller** (/u/UglyFossils) is a paleontologist at the University of Tennessee whose research focuses on the processes of fossilization, evolution, and biology, of crocodiles and their relatives, including identifying bite marks on fossils. Find her on Twitter @UglyFossils.

**Becky Barnes** (/u/ScientistGinkgo) is paleontologist and Lab Manager of the Johnsrud Paleontology Lab, with the ND Geological Survey. She worked on preparing part of the tail, foot, and body block of Dakota the Dinomummy.

**Clint Boyd** (/u/PalaeoBoyd) is the Senior Paleontologist at the North Dakota Geological Survey and Curator of the North Dakota State Fossil Collection. His research focus in on ornithischian dinosaurs, including specimens of Edmontosaurus like Dakota the Dinomummy.

**Mindy Householder** (/u/Mindles1308) is a fossil preparator with the State Historical Society of North Dakota. She prepared the right arm, portions of the left foot, helped with parts of the tail, and is currently preparing the body block of Dakota the Dinomummy.

Text: So current genetic testing of IVF embryos is to get the egg and sperm together, make a bunch of embryos, wait a few days to see which ones grow and then to pop them open, scrape out a bunch of cells and then send them to the lab. The lab then tests those cells for any abnormalities (aneuploidy, etc) while the embryos get frozen. Once results are back the cleared embryos can be implanted one at a time until one takes.

So there has been some research on childhood cancer risk of frozen embryos and that seems to be a bit elevated relative to standard - 1.6-1.7 times.

https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1004078

This is still a fairly new process and we don’t know if there are any impacts later in life from freezing, it’s an open question as frozen embryo children hit middle age. Fingers crossed.

My question was on the genetic testing side. If you have an embryo and pop it open and remove a bunch of the very first cells, then the remaining cells step up and still deliver a baby. That is established. What impacts might arise from the cell removal process though? Like if you were going to have 100 cells at that point and are now down to 90 or whatever then would that have any impacts later in life? The remaining cells need to divide more I guess. Thoughts?

I am currently having difficulty understanding the difference between a free radical and a radical neutral. I know a free radical is any transient species, but how does that differ from a radical neutral? My research is into plasma characteristics, and a quote from the paper I am reading states, &quot;the most important parameter in low-temperature plasmas is often the density of the radical neutral.&quot; I'm not too sure what this means without understanding radical neutrals.

Any clarity on radical neutrals/the above quote would be much appreciated! :)

Text: In a PSNV (Psycho-social emergency treatment) course I heard about medicine that's used as PEP (post-exposure prophylactic) on people in a shock/catatonic state. It is supposed to help the people process the events and not cause long-term psychological trauma.

The technical disaster relief of Germany, a (about) 98% volunteer force that's put into all kinds of large-scale-catastrophes has that course mandatory for all its members. It was explained that the government has a lot of doctors all over Germany that have this medication in-stock at all times should it be needed.

Not sure if it's exactly psychology or medicine, I think since it's mostly Pharmacology and Psychiatry the Medicine flag fits best.

I couldn't find anything about this with my crude googling though so I wanted to ask here - what is it and how does it work?

Text: With the Columbian Exchange, species like horses, pigs, maize, tomatoes, potatoes and others became available on both continents. Moose are native to both continents, but are also the same species, which seems odd to have not diverged in however many millions of years. 

I would be very surprised if early European explorers successfully put moose onto ships to bring them to another continent, without even beginning to discuss why they would try that. At least horses are useful and domesticated.

Text: I'm a nursing student, and I'm currently studying my second physiology unit. My materials all say that when a blood vessel is damaged, vasoconstriction occurs to reduce the pressure and flow of blood, so that the platelet plug is not dislodged. This mostly makes sense to me, however it's my understanding that vasoconstriction means the same amount of blood flows through a smaller opening, thereby INCREASING blood pressure. Is there a different mechanism in place during haemostasis? Is the constriction occurring proximally to the clot, reducing the volume of blood? Is the heart output of blood changed? I can see the heart rate increasing in major injuries, thus lowering blood pressure, but what about for minor injuries?

Text: I guess &quot;mindreading&quot; would the the broad term for this, but I'm talking more like being able to record what someone is thinking and hearing when they are dreaming, hallucinating, or asked to imagine the image of a frog, for example. I know next to nothing about neurology, so this is probably way off, but I imagine that we'd have to first scan a person's brain so we can see what electrical impulses are occurring and where, and then we'd have to understand the function of each individual neuron or whatever, and then be able to interpret patterns from whatever the current combination of electric signals are in said person brain. Then we'd have to convert that analog information to a digital visual and auditory representation that can be displayed on a screen. But I suppose one of the biggest problems is that everyone's brain is different, so even if you could interpret one person's brain, it wouldn't work on another. You'd have to have some kind of AI that could dynamically analyze the pattern of any given person's brain and understand how it functions.

Again this is just my uninformed, speculative rambling. I'm interested to hear from more knowledgeable people how this could actually work though. The benefits of such a technology are truly mindblowing. Imagine the creative potential for art, music, fictional writing, movies, etc., if we were able to do this? Imagine being able to actually see and hear what a person experienced during a sleep paralysis episode! True horror movie potential right there. Imagine what we could learn about people with mental illness, or learn about the similarities in how we all think. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

Text: I've been looking at things like using [solar panels on water canals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCRX232VkBk) and other man made structures for water, in addition to technology just meant to reduce evaporation.   I see a bunch of figures like &quot;decreases evaporation by x%&quot; and it's being peddled as a solution to water crisis in dry areas (now made dryer due to climate change).  What I don't understand is that water has to get into the atmosphere to cause rain and other things.  So decreasing evaporation here reduces the amount of water going into the atmosphere.  If you aren't *increasing* the amount of water in the system (say in California), then you still have dry-problems, accept now, your soil might be even drier due to the humidity being lower over all, and you may even be affecting climates around the area inadvertently right? 

The only positive sum game I can see with this is if this somehow caused more *ocean* water to contribute to for example, the California climate.  

**So does preventing evaporation on these structures ultimately cause negative environmental impact over the long term?**

Neutrons however are scaled by their energy, for 10 - 100keV it would be 10, for 100keV - 2MeV it is 20. But for neutrons with an energy of 2 - 20MeV the factor goes back down to 10.

Text: In the last 200 million years, we had only one mass extinction : K-Pg extinction and that too is largely attributed to the astroid impact (an outside factor). Whereas before that, there were series of mass extinctions and collapses at much regular interval like we had Triassic extinction around 201 MYA, Permian extinction around 251 MYA, Carboniferous rainforest collapse around 300 MYA and Devonian extinctions between 375 and 360 MYA. These are mainly attributed to earth systems.

Is it just a coincidence that the number of big extinctions have came down or has the earth became better for life? I’m aware that we did had extinctions like the one at end of Last Glacial Maximum but I don’t think any were that drastic compared to what Earth used to have earlier.

Edit : I see lot of comments that I ignored the ongoing 6th mass extinction. Well, yes because I’m more interested in understanding this from the perspective of (natural) factors which caused the other extinctions mentioned like plate tectonics, volcanic activity etc.  So, please ignore the human effect as it takes this question in an entirely different direction. Apologies for not clarifying this earlier.

Text: I know this seems like a broad question, but I didn’t know how to summarize my question adequately for the title. I’ve been trying to understand different evidences of common ancestry, and one topic that had been brought up was the discovery of endogenous retroviruses and their presence in the human genome and other animals, which points to a common ancestor.

To clarify, my question is how do we know the retroviruses found in our DNA and the DNA of other species are from a virus infecting a common ancestor, and not a result of a prevalent virus in the past that infected multiple species around the same time, resulting in an alteration of the genomes of different species but occurring around the same time? If that makes sense.

I don’t necessarily believe that, but growing up in a very conservative, 6-day creationist, Christian household, I think that it’s a thought that could pop up in response to the ERV findings, so I am interested in what the rebuttal would be. I am not knowledgeable at all in these areas, and so I’m grateful to anyone who can help me understand and learn this in a simpler way, if possible. Thanks!

Text: There’s a layer of dust on the projector lens, which has been accumulating as the dust in the air get attracted to it. But what’s moving it? There’s no fan or anything in that part of the projector, so what force is moving them to the light source? Is the heat making some sort of airflow towards the lens? But then where does the air go after and why do the dust particles get stuck on the glass?

Text: There’s a research paper from 2008 that says anticholinergics can greatly weaken collagen *in pathogenic lung tissue* that's found in asthmatics. Specifically: “[In human lung fibroblasts, muscarinic receptors exert stimulatory  effects on collagen synthesis. Prolonged blockade of muscarinic-induced  collagen synthesis may contribute to reported beneficial long-term effects of anticholinergics in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease](https://href.li/?https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/32/3/555.long).” The muscarinic receptors they're talking about are acetycholine receptors. Anticholinergics block those. tldr, it’s *possible* that interference from anticholinergics can make already-existent collagen weaker. 

In 2013 there’s another citing the previous paper, finding that “[human tenocytes are stimulated to proliferate by acetylcholine through an EGFR signalling pathway](https://href.li/?https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3582816/)”, which seems to mean that &quot;progenitor&quot; tendon tissue responsible for making regular tendon tissue gets instructions to do that via acetylcholine. Anticholinergic drugs block acetylcholine, so the tenocytes would get less stimulation to produce new material, so old collagen doesn’t get replaced like it should. That would make it weak, but via a different method than the previous paper. Assuming this extends to all collagen  production and not just specifically tendon tissue, this adds on to the previous evidence that acetylcholine is needed for collagen synthesis, that anticholinergic drugs can interfere with the production of collagen and, if the previous paper is added in, possibly result in weaker collagen.

Citing *that* paper, in 2016 another paper looked at the effect of knocking out an acetylcholine receptor on arthritis, which is a collagen tissue: “[Taken together, the present study shows that while M3R−/−  mice \[the ones with the deleted receptor\] were not protected from CAIA \[induced arthritis\], they had a tendency toward a higher  inflammatory response after arthritis induction than WT mice \[normal mice\]. Further,  arthritis-induced joint destruction was significantly stronger in mice  with M3R deficiency, indicating that stimulation of M3R might have  protective effects on arthritis](https://href.li/?https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4719200/).” More or less this seems to mean that when the action of acetylcholine is blocked, which is what happens when you kill the receptor (and when you block it with anticholinergic drugs), the joint tissue is worse off and more inflamed. Thus acetlycholine appears to be necessary for healthy tissue, and without it the tissue is worse.

In healthy people an anticholinergic drug may not cause any noticeable problems, but in people with collagen disorders who have a preexisting synthesis and weakness issue, it could drastically compound the existing problems, or even incite symptoms that didn’t previously exist. As far as I’m aware, we don’t actually know the mechanism of why collagen is weaker in any collagen disorders; it’s possible that acetylcholine differences could be a reason, and if they are, then drugs that block the action of that would naturally make the problem worse. 

**Does anyone know if this is indeed an established thing, that healthy collagen does require acetylcholine and that anticholinergics cause weaker tissue?**

Text: According to a Wikipedia article on tropical rainforests climates, &quot;When tropical rainforest climates are more dominated by the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) than the trade winds (and with no or rare cyclones), so usually located near the equator, they are also called equatorial climates. Otherwise, when they are more dominated by the trade winds than the ITCZ, they are called tropical trade-wind climates. In pure equatorial climates, the atmospheric pressure is almost constantly low so the horizontal pressure gradient is low. Consequently, the winds are rare and usually weak (except sea and land breezes in coastal areas) while **in tropical trade-wind climates, often located at higher latitudes than the equatorial climates, wind is almost permanent which incidentally explains why rainforest formations are impoverished compared to those of equatorial climates due to their necessary resistance to strong winds accompanying tropical disturbances.&quot;** Does this mean that in places such as Central America, Hawaii, and the Philippines, which have rainforests that are farther from the equator, (above 10 degrees North latitude) the trees are generally not as tall?

I know the weather for my city for today is intermittent rains, about 50% cloud coverage. But why can't I find out if my street address will have sun or rain in half an hour? It's currently raining. Does it make sense to wait for it to stop within next hour or so, or should I call a taxi home?

I can find &quot;possible thunderstorms in the evening&quot; a day ahead, but I can't tell if I have 15 minutes to roll my BBQ and hide before everything's drenched, or the heavy dark clouds I see rolling over the city will pass me to the side and leave my area dry. 

With current technology it feels like it *should* be easy enough to predict weather for a specific spot. Sure there will still be situation when the prediction is uncertain; the cloud passes just by, it may go 200m west or 200m east from me and I'll get rain or not. But in most cases it should be perfectly predictable that a cloud raining here, moving in this direction, at this speed, will rain there, in x minutes, and with this size it will take that many minutes to pass.

Text: After seeing a football player tear their ACL while running (non contact injury), without being hit, I got curious.   Do knee ligaments or your Achilles tendon go from perfectly fine to torn from something like that? Or does the injury actually build up over time with small tears or something.

If so, is or could there be anything done to know in advance someone is at risk for this injury or restore/repair their ligament.  

If not what would make the one time a person hurt their ACL while running, which didn't look particularly violent, different than any other that didn't cause the injury?

Text:  A large portion of our already oversized brains is used for coordinating our limbs. This makes some sense since there is a lot of &quot;math&quot; that needs to be worked out for the inverse kinematics of something as simple as buttoning a button. But how do small animals, like spiders, manage complex tasks with comparatively few brain cells. Brains are costly in terms of metabolism and evolution is not wasteful. So I am assuming there is a reason why we require literally billions of CNS neurons to coordinate our limbs while spiders get by on just tens of thousands.

These are some truly vibrant colours. That surely can’t just be by chance.

What could be the purpose of a bright red or orange visual signal on a dormant and dying leaf?

Edit: I'm most curious about the red colours that appear in Eastern North America in diverse species like Sugar Maples, dogwoods like Cornus sericea, or wild grapes like Vitis riparia. Where I am in Southern Ontario, these species and others can go a *vibrant* nearly flower-petal red, or even purple.

Text: (Quick info to start with, I'm from Germany, so I may make some mistakes with the technical vocabulary and some best practices may differ)


So this is a kinda awkward question for me to ask, considering I'm an electrical engineer planning the electrical systems for all kind of construction projects, and I like to think I'm quite good at it, including the technical side.


But during a conversation with a colleague yesterday, we noticed we both can't quite explain how exactly the drection of the flow of power is measured in AC power systems (compared to DC, where it's really easy). We both know it's possible, we both have watched old electricity meters (like [this one](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Drehstromzaehler_offen.jpg)) run backwards when either wired incorrectly or when the measured system is actually feeding power into the mains, for example with solar panels. And while I understand the basic principles of those old meters (it's essentially a finely tuned linear induction motor), what I can't figure out is how the **direction** of the powerflow is determined. Even worse with modern electronic meters, those don't even have moving parts where I could at least justify that they work the same as the old ones. And yet those to can determine the direction and don't measure currents running in the opposite direction (for example again with solar panels when you don't actually have a contact for receive compensation for the power you provide. The meter simply doesn't count up or down when you produce more than you need and thus are feeding into the mains. Mechanical meters solved this with a ratchet system.)

AC power doesn't have an inherent direction, that's its fundamental principle. So how do those meters do it? The only thing I can come up with is that it's basically more like &quot;measuring&quot; the voltage differential between one side and the other, or at least that that is what determines the direction. But *how*? What physical effects are used to electronically measure if power is flowing from A to B and when it's going from B to A?

Thanks for any explanations you can provide, the more detailed and in depth the better.

It seems that it may be easy to determine the area of dark space farthest from any galaxy.

However, I wanted to know if there was any place locally. 

Since Sol’s Oort Cloud theoretically extends to nearly Alpha Centauri - if Alpha Centauri has a similar cloud, is there an area of space in our galaxy that is not affected by or apart of some star’s heliosphere or Oort Cloud?

And if it is possible for such a place to exist so we know or have a theory on where this extrasolar Point Nemo is?

Text: There have been recents posts on the disinterest American males have on having children in /r/science (among other places). Conversely, I was just reading about the difficulties in policing child labor in Bangladesh.

We know that, generally speaking, as a country becomes more affluent, birth rates decline. So it made me wonder how much economic factors are playing a role in birth rates globally.

An often cited reason for people to not want children in the United States is that they are expensive and that they don't think that raising children would make them happy.

Intuitively, it seems to me that those in extreme poverty could be having children potentially due to the fact that they will provide income to the parents and the closest thing the parents can get to a retirement plan. But is that true? Are economics (or personal finance, I suppose you could say) really a major motivating factor in the choice to have children worldwide?

What are the mechanisms involved in further combustion of the material that result in the ash changing from a compound which essentially absorbs all photons in the visible spectrum making it appear black, to a compound that largely scatters light in the visible spectrum appearing white?

Text: Of course perceived color is subjective, and in practice the same object can appear very different under different light conditions, angles, etc.  I'm wondering if there's *any* standard system to assess &quot;the&quot; color for an object, perhaps by observing its reflection in an ISO-standard light box.  If so, is there a standard way to convert that into human-visible color in RGB terms, given an ISO-standard monitor?  Is there an industry standard calculation between the output of a visual-wavelength telescope and an image on nasa.gov?

If it helps: I was reading about [gilding metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilding_metal) and wondered if there was a visual difference between, say 6:1 Cu/Zn brass and 12:1 Cu/Zn brass, assuming two samples were measured in the same facility after processing them to equal polish, etc.

Text: There have long been concerns about the health risks from artificial sweeteners. For example, recent studies indicate that artificial sweeteners could elevate blood sugar levels and raise one's risk of heart disease or stroke. There have also been reports that they alter our gut biome in harmful ways.  For example this quote ( [Artificial Sweeteners Alter Gut Bacteria in Humans | The Scientist Magazine® (the-scientist.com)](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/artificial-sweeteners-alter-gut-bacteria-in-humans-70395) ):

&quot; Now, working in the lab of Weizmann Institute of Science immunologist Eran Elinav, Suez and colleagues have taken an array of common artificial sweeteners—saccharin, sucralose, aspartame, and stevia—and filled that gap in the literature by testing them in humans. Their findings, described today (August 19) in [*Cell*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.07.016), suggest these sweeteners do indeed alter the gut microbiome, as was seen in prior mouse work. This, the researchers say, adversely impacts glucose tolerance, a measure of how readily the body moves sugar from the blood into muscle and fat, possibly leading to weight gain and diabetes. &quot;

My question is, are &quot;natural&quot; sweeteners such as those based on Monk Fruit (which gets its sweetness from a compound called, &quot;mogroside V&quot; and is often mixed with erythritol) chemically similar to artificial sweeteners and do they carry the same health risks?

I have been using monk fruit for almost two years - and recently found my blood sugar levels are too high (despite being slender and extremely fit).  Could Monk fruit be the cause?

Text: I am currently reading &quot;What happened to you&quot;, and in it Dr. Perry repeatedly states the fact that negative experiences within the first two months of childhood have a more significant impact on a child than ones in the next twelve years.

He goes on to state that children who have had a bad experience in the first two months and then only positive experiences for the next 12 years have worse outcomes than children in the opposite situation.

This struck me as something that would be really hard to test. How many children are really out there that bad experiences only for the first two months of their lives? How were we able to know they had bad experiences then when the children were unable to recall what happened to them?

For most two month olds isn't virtually every experience a negative one? Everything is new and scary when experienced for the first time, how would you be able to tell which/how many experiences were and were not traumatic for the child?

Text: This might be a bit of a weird question, but hopefully you can bear with me. From what I understand, AI image generators are based off of training a neural network on a whole bunch of images and then being able to recall bits of them and combine them into new images. This is supposed to be analogous to how our neurons work and how our imagination would draw from our memories to create new images.

So one thing I noticed was that it is easy to imagine an image, say an image of the letter A. It is also very easy to imagine it rotated 90 degrees so that it is sideways. However, it seems to me that AI image generators probably can't produce rotated versions of their memories. From what I understand the images are remembered all in specific orientations relative to each other, and so unless it was fed pictures of sideways A's there wouldn't be any way for it to derive rotated A's from images of upright A's.

I tried putting things like &quot;sideways letter A&quot;, &quot;rotated letter A&quot;, and &quot;letter A on its side&quot; in Dall-E, but it always only ever turned out A's the right way up. The closest I could get was &quot;tree on its side&quot;, but that just made pictures of trees that had fallen over, not making a rotated picture out of an upright memory. I don't think there we need to have seen pictures of a sideways A or tree to imagine it.

Obviously our brain can recognize the edges between objects and some more advanced stuff, which I'd guess are also possible for neural networks if they were designed for it, but the only possibility for rotating images that I'm aware of is using abstract math. From what I understand, rotating an object is something that involves things like complex numbers, vectors, or linear algebra, so not the simplest kinds of math. I guess I have a hard time understanding how our brain could be doing math like that without us consciously being aware of it, or how something like that could evolve in the first place. It seems like you would need a pretty specific arrangement of neurons to act like logic gates to do more advanced math, which I don't think neural networks are capable of. If there is math like this going on, where is it happening?

There's probably a very obvious answer to this question, but I appreciate people humoring me.

Text: I've been having this discussion with a friend, and realized that I needed to do more investigation. I referenced a 60 Minutes episode (from a few years ago) where a scientist was able to determine if somebody was white or black just by looking at accelerometer data from when they would jump on and off of a sensor. This was independent of age, sex, or body size, implying some underlying difference in musculature and nerve reaction.

My friend countered with [this article](https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/health-general-science/are-you-there-race-its-me-dna), which calls into question whether or not race is a relevant term, and which points out that genetic diversity between we humans is really quite small. There was also [this interesting discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/10m8st/from_a_genetic_perspective_are_human_races/) along similar lines here on Reddit several years ago.

For the sake of this, let's ignore DNA testing, which I understand to be quite accurate for determining heritage. I'm also not fully convinced that arguments regarding the similarity or dis-similarity of the genetic code in a population is actually relevant. Even a tiny mutation can lead to [dramatic differences](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/gk-and-current-affairs/story/genetic-disorders-263627-2015-09-18) in structure.

So, rephrasing the question... can examination of the skeleton and/or internal organs provide sufficient information to determine whether someone is primarily from one population or another?

I'm wondering if epigenetic changes show up and make a difference in DNA. I'm not very good at science, but I know personal gene expressions can change over the years and I was curious if that would be representative in raw DNA sample files. Should people re-submit a DNA sample if they good through significant changes over the years, or would the raw data remain the same? 

&amp;#x200B;

Say, for example, someone submits a DNA sample to 23andme or a similar website, and at the time they are very active and muscular, and at an average weight. If that same person were to submit a new DNA sample a decade later and were overweight and sedentary at the time of the new test, would the raw DNA change?

A piece of raw meat is moderately firm, if supple.
Cooked well, it becomes phenomenally soft tender and soft, such that it barely requires chewing;
HOWEVER, with the heat applloed differently, it can char into an even firmer, harder, state.

What's going on chemically?
Obviously the intensity and time of the heat applied plays a role; what other factors are involved? Are there consistent principles? What are they?

Text: Hello all, I've been deeply interested in Planetary Sciences and the early evolution of the solar system. I'm also the lead on the initial Mineralogy/Petrology of the meteorites found by the Australian Desert Fireball Network (DFN), an interdisciplinary research group that is working to uncover the mysteries surrounding solar system formation. Digital observatories, part of the DFN, monitor a third of Australian skies, all night. The DFN images and studies the paths of fireballs in the sky, their trajectories, and orbits using intelligent imaging systems. As a geologist, I want to know where rocks come from, along with their composition and distribution. Trying to mesh those two is kind of the holy grail in figuring out what the solar system is really like. In 2006, an asteroid was named after me - Asteroid 6579 - for my contributions to planetary science.

In August 2022, my work was featured in [Interesting Engineering](https://interestingengineering.com/science/astrogeologist-space-rocks-important), and the publication helped organize this AMA session. Ask me anything about asteroids, meteorites, planetary science, and my work with the Desert Fireball Network.

I'll be on 5 PM (November 29th US ET / 22 UT / November 30th 6 AM in Perth (GMT+8)) to answer your questions, AMA!

Text: Hello,

I would like to start off by saying I know this is a dumb question, but I cannot find the answer anywhere else on the internet, and I would really appreciate some help. I basically don't understand the statement, &quot;*when sufficient energy is crammed into a sufficiently small space, particles that were not previously present can sometimes be created out of that energy.&quot;* This quote is from this article:

[**https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/particle-physics-why-do-it-and-why-do-it-that-way/**](https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/particle-physics-why-do-it-and-why-do-it-that-way/)

The article is from a website, Of Particular Significance, by Matt Strassler. Really cool website for those particle physics geeks out there, and can accomodate all knowledge levels. I posted a comment last June, but since I have still received no response (*ahem* Matt), I have taken matters into my own hands. Below is the original comment, commented under Vector Hugo.

So, this sentence really confused me at first, “It is a remarkable property of nature that when sufficient energy is crammed into a sufficiently small space, particles that were not previously present can sometimes be created out of that energy.” I was sitting here with minimal scientific background, and I’m just like, ‘Did the Law of Conservation of Mass AND the Law of Conservation of Energy just go out the window?!!’ Anyways, after reading the comments, I grew a better understanding and addition to more questions. Am I interpreting this the right way? Why are these laws still taught in schools? More importantly: HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE???thank you

I'd like to thank anyone that took the time to respond or to just read some responses. Any comments/further questions are appreciated!!

Text: Hello all! Bit of background: I'm a physical chemist by training, and did my doctoral work on self-assembly in conjugated polyelectrolytes. In that field there are open questions about how things like temperature, pH, salt content drive and control self-assembly and processes like liquid-liquid phase separation. I recently came across this [article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33955104/) discussing liquid-liquid phase separation of Tau. I have very marginal knowledge of the state of Alzheimer's research and whether the various hypotheses regarding plaque aggregation are causal or symptomatic. So I'd like to know more about whether the CNS of folks with Alzheimer's varies significantly in its pH and electrolytic balance vs a normative sample of CNS.

For the record: I'm no longer in academia (although I still have journal access) and my industry is semiconductors, not biomedical. So I'm not fishing for competitive advantage in this field.

Cheers, and thank you.

Text: I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the Harvard/Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. I use a mix of telescope observations, stellar evolution models, and Milky Way surveys to study binary stars -- that is, pairs of stars that are orbiting each other and (in most cases) formed from the same gas cloud. My collaborators and I recently published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06833) reporting the discovery of a binary containing a dormant black hole and a Sun-like star, orbiting each other at roughly the same distance as the Earth and the Sun. The black hole is about 10 times the mass of the Sun, so its event horizon is about 30 km. At a distance of about 1600 light years from Earth, it's about 3 times closer than the next-closest known black hole.

The black hole is fairly different from other stellar-mass black holes we know about, which are almost all bright X-ray and radio sources. They're bright because they're feeding on a companion star, and gas from the star forms a disk around the black hole where it gets heated to millions of degrees. That's how we discover those black holes in the first place. But in this one -- which we named Gaia BH1 -- the companion star is far enough away that the black hole isn't getting anything to eat, and so it's not bright in X-rays or radio. The only reason we know it's there at all is that we can see the effects of its gravity on the Sun-like star, which is orbiting an invisible object at a 100 km/s clip.

[Here's](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/05/science/astronomy-black-hole.html) a NYT article with more info about the discovery, and [here's](https://www.mpia.de/news/science/2022-16-gaia-bh1) a press release that goes into somewhat more detail.

AMA about this discovery, black holes, stars, astronomy, or anything else! I'll start answering questions at 1:30 PM Eastern (1830 UT), AMA!

In 2020, my team and I studied two patients with epilepsy who also had PTSD characterized by heightened fear responses to things that reminded them of their trauma. Post surgery that targeted the right amygdala, both the patients no longer suffered from PTSD.

• If we insert a new gene, how exactly do we deliver it? Does it come with the CAS9 and guide RNA complex? Or do we use another enzyme to deliver it separately?

We've just gone through a pandemic where period life expectancy declined in the US two years in a row. Presuming SARS-Cov-2 doesn't go away, and we have a new added cause of death at 2021/2022 rates, would we expect a similar downwards lag? 

I'm wondering if we would expect period life expectancy to stay the same as it was in 2021, other things equal? Or would it continue to decline further?

Text: If we compare a 50 y/o human and a 50 y/o mammal with a 200-year life span, have both organisms experienced a similar number of apoptosis cycles? Do cells grow and die at a slower rate in long-lived organisms, or do they cycle at the same pace, but the organisms have more ways to stop awry cells before they develop into tumours? Or something third I’m not thinking of? I’m trying to understand if, say, their mitochondria or some other structural element is inherently different or if they have more ways to “take out the trash”? TIA!

Text: As far as I remember, the oxygen we breathe in becomes the final electron acceptor on the electron transport chain during cell respiration, and is released as water due to the electrons it accepts or something like that. I thought the CO2 came from the pyruvate decarboxylation step immediately after glycolysis. Doesn’t this mean that the CO2 we breathe out is converted from what we eat, not what we breathe?

Text: Lots of diseases like cancer arise spontaneously, and I'm not sure you can specifically breed certain animals to be susceptible to very specific genetic mutations. So when they need to test treatments for specific rare diseases like that how do they do it?

Are there facilities that raise thousands of primates and pray that some of them develop triple-negative breast cancer (or whatever specific disease you're testing treatments for)?

I imagine this is especially important when you're designing drugs like monoclonal antibodies that target specific factors and are increasingly designed for more and more specific diseases

Text: I've read about a  [biggest cosmic explosion in history](https://nautil.us/brightest-ever-space-explosion-reveals-possible-hints-of-dark-matter-244346/) and it caused photons with at least 18 TeV of energy. Since frequency and energy are connected, it looks like that amount of energy would correspond to approx. 10\^24 Hz, which is unimaginably a lot. The wavelength for this frequency should be on the order of 10\^-16 m. Planck length is 10\^-34 m so there's still a lot of room to go there, but by that logic, there's absolutely a (huge) upper limit for a photon to have. Going backwards, Planck length to frequency, that's 10\^43 Hz and energy of about 7 GJ, or about 10\^16 TeV. Is this reasoning sound? If so, is that the absolute maximum energy a photon can have?

Playing around with numbers, that means each photon has a relativistic mass of 80 ug, which is huge. Is the only thing stopping us from generating photons of such (&quot;maximum&quot;) energy, that there are no particles with that kinds of mass which we could annihiliate?

It's apparently because of the amount debris, &quot;hurled out into space, creating a comet-like trail of dust and rubble stretching several thousand miles.&quot;  Does this discrepancy really mean that knowing its mass and trajectory aren't enough to predict what sort of strike will generate the necessary change in trajectory of an asteroid?  Will we also have to be able to predict the extent and nature of fragmentation?  Does this become a structural problem, too?

There are fewer than 120 ocelots remaining in the US. With many factors acting against them, there is still hope for their survival, if opposing parties can come to an agreement on their management methods. I've spent years in Texas capturing the first-ever high-quality footage of American ocelots in the wild, meeting with stakeholders along the way to raise awareness about conservation solutions.

You can learn more about these efforts in the recent PBS Nature documentary &quot;[American Ocelot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiQ8zOlWHUQ&amp;t),&quot; now available to stream in the US.

However, it is known that gibbons and humans both have variants for both A and B blood types, and those variants come from a common ancestor that lived 20 million years ago. Then doesn't it mean blood type AB existed at least before 16th century, while AB is just a mixture of A and B?

Which one is correct? What is the scholars' mainstream opinion about it now?

I understand that certain things are &quot;radioactive&quot; to a lesser or greater degree. What I don't understand yet is that if a material is subcritical, is it possible to be in a room with that material without being adversely affected due to the low amount of radiation? If more and more material is added bringing a closer to criticality does the amount of radiation increase slowly making my proximity to the material more dangerous, or does the material remain at the same level of radioactivity until criticality where it will suddenly emit large amounts of radiation making my proximity unsafe.

I hope my amateur explanation is clear.

Text: My title is a bit of a click bait but my question is more technical. Let's assume that the dark matter theory is the correct one. It affects how stars are orbiting around their respective galactic center. Since dark matter is really additional mass and not some anti-gravity matter, it should be everywhere in a galaxy and its vicinity (and I assume the amount is more or less equally spread). So dark matter should also give our solar system additional mass that have an impact on the object orbiting around our sun for instance no ?

im guessing it would depend on the ant specie and the house size so for this lets say its an apartment 120m2. dont know much about the ant's specie, its smaller than the average black ones you see outdoors and lighter in color, almost yellow.

Specifically, how exactly do nanocavities enhance photon emissions? Everywhere that I have read simply states that they enhance the density of final states, but how exactly do they do this?

Also, what exactly does the Purcell factor itself mean? Is it simply a scalar multiple indicating how much the initial emission rate is multiplied by?

Text: I went on a visit to my local submarine museum this weekend, and had the opportunity to hear a talk by an ex submariner. One of the things he talked about was the red light in the control room. Part of the reason he gave for red lights was to do with night vision, which is well discussed elsewhere. 

But he gave a second reason, which was that when the periscope was up white light would travel up the periscope, alerting others to your presence.  Red light apparently &quot;lacks the power to travel up the periscope&quot;, and so you don't turn your submarine into a lighthouse. 

Is this true? And if so what's the physics behind it?

Eta: to be clear, I understand the night vision part. I only mention it to try and clarify that it wasn't the question, but apparently I failed. The question is specifically about the light travelling up the periscope, and given that red light travels better than other colours in air if this is true there's something more subtle than just an energy dependence going on.

Even in subsonic conditions, a flame can get blown out at high gas speed (I am not sure why). My brain hurts...

Are there any reasonable estimates how much oil is not from plankton? I would expect values well below 1 %, but feels like at least *some* of fossil fuel molecules could be from dinosaurs.

However, with steep enough banking of the road, or tilting the road inwards, it should’ve been possible to maintain that speed while getting the required amount of centripetal force. This made me think that either there is some physical reason why banking at, say, 45° isn’t possible, or there is a competitive one. However, I’ve noticed there seems to be a limitation on the banking angle on public roads as well. Why is this the case?

Text: Obesity rates have gone up considerably in recent years. Surely there are many factors to this like individual diets and genetics. What I would like to know is if poor dietary choices can lead to obesity causing genetic defects in children that they would otherwise not suffer from if the parents ate more responsibly. If so, is something that can be reversed with the next generation given the right dietary choices are made?

Do we know if any species that spent part of their evolutionary history exclusively in post-separation Antarctica still exist today?

Text: In many of my signal analysis and other engineering classes, we have to perform Fourier Transforms to analyze specific time domain problems in its frequency domain and decompose respective signals. These problems got me wondering whether our or a mammal’s brain decomposes various sounds that heard everyday. For instance, if we’re talking with a friend in a public space, how does our brain know which sounds to filter out (other people talking in the vicinity) and which sounds not to filter out (sound of a friend’s voice). Is this mechanism simply the brain performing Fourier Transforms instantaneously or is it simply a biological mechanism?

Text: El Niño/La Niña changes

I am in the PNW and we are expecting our third La Niña winter in a row, meaning a wet and cold winter for us. My basic understanding of how El Niño or La Niña is predicted is based on the water temperature in the Pacific either being half a degree warmer or colder than average.
My question is, is it possible to be in a La Niña cycle and have the water temperature change to make it an El Niño cycle instead?

Text: I just discovered on Wikipedia that, contrary to my intuition, deer, moose, giraffes, camels, and sheep are all only very distantly related to horses. The former are all Artiodactyla while horses are Perissodactyla. This is rather strange to me because they look very similar and certainly more similar than a moose and an orca do (apparently orcas are also Artiodactyla). How is it possible that orcas and moose are more related than horses and moose?

Edit: For clarification, I understand how phylogeny works based on shared ancestry, not morphology. What I am more interested in is any more in-depth background on how the decision was made to classify ungulates based on toe parity, and perhaps anything on how exactly orcas fit into this.

Text: So I was watching a report on the effects of Ivermectin treatment for Covid-19 vs a control group. This caused me to wonder about a more drastic medical situation such as the need to test a potential life saving medication for the treatment of something like cancer. I'm a software developer by training and trade, so I have an understanding of the scientific process, but I tend to work in a field where if I make a mistake...no one will die.

So assume I have a new drug that has the potential to be extremely effective at treating cancer. I believe due diligence would require to perform double blind randomized testing with this medication as well as a placebo. At this point, I feel like there's an ethical issue because are we not knowingly taking individuals with a life threatening illness and deliberately giving them a non treatment? I know there are all sorts of nuances to what I'm asking and I'm sure it's not as simple as saying the control group is receiving no treatment. But how do we test life saving medication knowing that part of our group is not going to receive any medication whatsoever? 

Or am I just drastically off base in how medicine is developed and studied?

Edit: wow, thank you everyone! I really appreciate the great responses! It all makes a lot more sense to me now.

I understand why smuggling gold OUT of the country could be harmful, but what economic harm could come from smuggling gold IN? Presumably people are smuggling gold so that they can sell it for fiat currency. I would think that exchanging their less valuable, inflated currency for a more tangible asset like gold, which holds its value and could be exchanged for more valuable foreign currency, would be an overall positive for their economy.

Text: I was reading about the strong force and color confinement recently, but everything I read seemed to only talk about an isolated nucleon.  

A brief reading of the Nuclear Force (the binding force between nucleons) which can be viewed as a &quot;residual strong force&quot; indicates it is mediated by virtual mesons.  To my completely uneducated mind, that reads as though the nuclear force is almost like nucleons swapping quarks between one another (as a meson is a quark-antiquark pair). 

I'm assuming I'm reading too much into it and letting my uninformed imagination run a bit too wild.  Because my loose understanding of virtual particles is that they're just a byproduct of random fluctuations in the quantum fields.  But then that makes me think that maybe it doesn't make sense to say that a nucleon has &quot;ownership&quot; over its quarks at all, if its quarks can't really be distinguished.  Which only furthers my question of if each nucleon is clearly a separate entity while in a nucleus or not.

Text: The mirror test, as I understand it, is as simple as putting a dot or a mark on an animal's forehead or other part visible in the mirror, then showing the animal their reflection to see if they interact with the mark in any way. My question is, why would we expect an animal to interact with a mark that either 1) they might just think the mark was always there, or 2) the mark wasn't bothering them before so why bother with it now? Sure, some animals might care, but I'd say cats or dogs probably wouldn't give a darn about the dot, even if they did recognize themselves in the mirror. How is the mirror test actually telling us anything about if animals recognize their reflections or not? I would think it's very assumptious to say that animals who haven't passed this test cannot identify themselves in a mirror, but am I somehow wrong?

Text: If you've ever watched the shoreline on a big body of water, especially where people are surfing for example, you've seen what I'm talking about. The ocean surface will be relatively calm with smaller waves coming in, and then all of a sudden, a handful of larger waves come, then the ocean calms down again for a period of time. These groups of waves are often called &quot;sets&quot; or I've also read &quot;wave trains&quot;.

I understand how and why ocean waves form, how different frequencies emerge from storms and how the shorter period ones die out as the larger/longer ones eventually can move across entire oceans with relatively little loss in energy. I have a decent understanding of certain types of waves and their dynamics as I studied engineering in school, and have also been an avid surfer for twenty years.

However, I've searched online numerous times for an explanation as to **WHY** or **HOW** ocean waves group into sets, rather than simply remaining as a uniform train of similar waves, and nobody seems to ever explain the mechanisms behind it. They simply mention that it happens, and move on.

An astrophysicist friend once explained acoustic resonance to me as his guess to a possible reason, which seemed to have something to it, but I truly have no idea. My latest search's top result yielded &quot;large period waves combine with local short period waves to form these groups&quot; which is complete BS.

Thank you very much!

Text: I was thinking about this and I am quite curious if something like Olympus Mons could form here. (Not really an exact replica, but somewhat similar with some changes.)

The characteristics I am thinking about is pretty much a stationary plate, a powerful hotspot (similar to the Hawaiian hotspot) and a stable crust (a thick craton) for such a volcano (more like a really high plateau) to stand on with minimal sinkage.

The conditions met would not really exist on Earth at some time or another, but the closest thing to that, in my opinion, is the Tibesti mountains in Africa, where a hotspot underneath the Saharan Meta-craton produced a few volcanoes.

Could it exist in some form and, if so, what process would lead to that and how would it form?

If said tree were kept at optimal conditions and it doesn't go into hibernation regardless, and it were fruit-producing, would it produce fruit year-round as well, or just annually?

Even by the most conservative &quot;dog age to human age&quot; calculations, this seems to be around 140 years in human age. This is significantly higher than the oldest human lifespan ever recorded, which led me to wonder if the translation breaks down as dogs get older. 

It's already known to be non-linear because temporal age and developmental age aren't linearly transferable across species, but it makes me wonder if dogs actually have higher lifespan variance than humans or if it's just an incomplete model.

Text: While doing an experiment using germanium semi-conductor detector,  we used a radioactive material, which decays via positron emission. Now, this positron is emitted with some kinetic energy and   when it annihilates an electron, the total energy is higher than rest mass energy of electron+ positron. In order to conserve both energy and momentum, two photons will be emitted. Now my question is, will the wavelength of photon be lesser than 2.4 pm ( which corresponds to both electron and positron being at rest during collision) . 

Although it seems very obvious, that the wavelength should be less than 2.4pm, but while discussing this with my professor, he said a positron won't annihilate an electron unless it is in rest state before it collides with an electron??. Didn't make any sense to me why this should happen? Can somebody explain.

Hello all, 

Are there any cases where an individual might test negative (outside of the window period) using HIV RNA PCR &amp; antibody/antigen testing despite actually being positive?

Is it possible that someone might have some weird/rare mutation that causes the HIV RNA PCR test to not detect any HIV despite it being present?

If so, would that mutation also impact the HIV antibodies to where they are also not detectable?

Would there be a way to do this without having to change out the filament? 

Also, I'm guessing the tubes don't emit just a perfect x ray frequency, but probably a range of frequencies. Is this true? Is it emitting a broad spectrum like any/all frequencies from the range of A to B, or does it output in &quot;peaks&quot; like the ionization of gasses?

Text: Low-stakes question about fasting blood work here. Does the length of the fasting time affect the data significantly? I was wondering because I ended up fasting for close to 14 hrs before having blood work done (I was stranded on a broken-down metro car for 2 hours trying to  get to the clinic, heh). A lot of my values were in the normal range but borderline. I was wondering if the extra-long fasting time could have affected things, and if it’s likely the values would have been outside of the normal range if I had fasted for the usual amount of time. Like, if the values drop at a rate of X units/hr, perhaps letting it go for a couple of extra hours could have falsely pushed them down into the normal range….? Is there any data looking at that kind of thing? Or is it generally assumed not to matter too much?

Text: We are told that influenza type A is likely no longer contagious 48 hours after fever goes away, but other symptoms (such as cough, sneeze, mucus) may linger around long after that.

It seems natural to me that cough, sneeze and mucus are all vehicles for the virus to spread, and it seems strange to me that the lack of fever should have much correlation with how infections these vehicles remain.

What are the influenza contagion mechanisms that determine when you are contagious?

Text: A Chinese doctor discover COVID 19 was circulating. However, we all get sick and go to the doctor to discover we don’t have COVID or Strep and there is no attempt to figure out what is making people sick. (The two things doctors test generally). 

Meanwhile lots of people are getting sick and if it progresses to something worse it is defined by what it caused, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. 

I find it odd at any university in the US a dozen students in each class are out sick then the next week or two another dozen. Each absence is costly, yet even at Universities when the students go to the doctors on campus they make no attempt to study “what is this illness” and whether warning classes about what is spreading or attempt to isolate it or stop it. When it knocks these young adults out for a week it could be a terrible “bug” yet the doctor’s reaction is “it is just some sort of bug.”

Text: From what I learned in high school, every B cell in every lymph node is entirely unique since the structure of the surface receptors is randomly generated, causing each B cell to recognise a different antigen. However, whenever there is an infection in the body, it always seems like the closest lymph nodes are the ones active, eg. under the jaw during a cold, or under the armpit after a vaccine. Wouldn’t there be just as much chance that the B cell able to identify your sore throat antigens lives in a lymph node further from the site of infection like the groin, ect.? Does the B cell travel to a closer lymph node  once activated? Or are there many different B cells that can recognise an antigen to varying degrees, and the closest ones mount the fastest immune response, even if a B cell further away could do a better job?

Text: The angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence when light is reflected from a smooth surface. 

What is the mechanism of this function? When light hits the surface, the energy of the photons are absorbed by the atoms that comprise the surface material. Then the atoms emit that energy as 'reflected' photons. Why do the atoms emit that energy in a particular direction, along a path defined by the angle of incidence? 

To my understanding, photonic energy has been absorbed in the form of electrons being excited to a higher energy level; then, the electrons return to their original energy level by emitting an equivalently energetic photon. At the atomic level, how does the direction of the incoming energy have an impact on direction in which the subsequent emission occurs?

Text: Can anyone explain to me why did we had variant after new variant of COVID for about 1,5 year but then suddenly stopped at Omicron. Why did it start creating sub-variants instead of new variants? 

Question popped into my head when I saw an article about a new BQ.1 subvariant

Text: I was talking with my wife about the ulnaris and radialis nerves and which fingers they control. As I understood, each nerve is responsible for the movement of more than one finger. Since these fingers can move (mostly) independently, we asked ourselves how the signal to move a specific finger is encoded or transported to the specific finger.

Is each nerve like a bundle of smaller nerves and each &quot;fiber&quot; only transmits the signal towards its specific receiver? Or is the signal somehow encoded and all signals travel through the same nerve and are somehow decoded at the correct recipient? Or are we totally wrong about how nerves function in general (I have heard about synapses, neurons and neurotransmitters but do not understand the &quot;macroscopic&quot; function of nerves.

In short: How can one nerve control several independently moveable fingers.

Thank you!

Text: Let me lead off by saying I *am* aware of the equation for this. I'm confused by some of the details. I've been trying to learn a thing or two about rocket engines and I'm struggling to pick apart this particular question.

So in the combustion chamber you've got an initial temperature and pressure (etc.) which are basically a function of the reactants you are using. These determine the area of the throat, which is sized so that you get sonic flow at that choke point. You need the A\* that gives M=1 at the throat.

But I'm confused about what determines the shape and size of the nozzle after that... Here's a few things I do understand:

* The propellant shifts to supersonic after the throat. Velocity increases as the area expands.
* Temperature and pressure drop as velocity increases.
* Ideally, you want the pressure at exit to be equal to ambient pressure. (This is mainly about efficiency?)
* The exact shape (and length?) isn't super important. It's mostly just about weight and cost.

I guess it's that third point is perhaps what has me confused. When I look at the equation for thrust, there's two terms:

1. mass flow rate \* exit velocity
2. exit area \* pressure difference from ambient

Let me assume a fixed mass flow rate. The equation for exit velocity is... basically a function of exit pressure. The other terms are basically all coming directly from your choice of fuel/oxidizer and other initial conditions. The exact term where it appears is `1-Pe/P0` so I think what that's saying is the &quot;ideal&quot; is zero exit pressure? The higher your exist pressure is to the initial pressure at combustion, the less energy you've gotten out of it. And lower exit pressure ultimately requires a larger nozzle exist area.

But then if the exit pressure is too low you start to suffer from the second term. Because if exit pressure is lower than ambient this term goes negative.

Am I right in understanding that this is the tricky balance you need to strike? And shooting for Pe=Pa is where it happens to be optimized for thrust?

Text: Information in metamorphic rocks

Hi guys. Italian science teacher here. I'm about to have classes on geology and with my biology background sometimes i find it difficult to craft a whole lesson out of the basic things i know. But let my cut to the chase.

I am trying to talk about rocks in terms of what information geologists can sqeeze out of them, then try to use that information as an opener for explaining cool stuff like tectonics and such. For example i showed igneous rocks and their connection with paleomagnetism (so that i can take that thing for granted when we will discuss the midatlantic ridge), and i talked about sedimentary rocks in terms of stratigraphy (that will come in handy often later on).

Now... what about metamorphic rocks? I just know that they lose information on fossils at the microscopic level, or i could point out that scists (not sure if i spelled it correctly in english) have an orientation dependent on the direction of the force that generated them, but this seems just details to me.

Do you have a bigger idea to throw at me? Thanks in advance (and sorry if my grammar and/or geology aren't sound)

Ciao!

Text: Just came back from a trip to Hawaii, and we drove over the Saddle Road, and I was really surprised by how many cinder cones are scattered all over the south side of Moana Kea. By contrast, there are comparatively few on the north side of Moana Loa. 

I've spent a lot of time around volcanoes in the PNW, from Mt. Baker to Shasta, and never seen that quantity of cinder cones on any of them (although Adams does have a very distinctive cinder cone on the north side.)  I assume at least some of them would be erased by glacial activity, but apparently Moana Kea used to have glaciers.

Text: I was thinking about the giant free &quot;ponds&quot; in Larry Niven's Integral Trees. On a planet, pressure as a function of depth is fairly straightforward. But if the water is held together only by cohesive forces, how does it change with &quot;depth&quot;? In the book they were free floating and various sized

Water is less dense as a solid so pressure causes it to melt, so I'm not thinking there could be a solid core by pressure.  I'm wondering, if there was a drop of water 14 miles across (so the center is as far from the surface s the Challenger Deep), what would the pressure be at the center? Could we scuba all the way through?

Maybe it would help to imagine a spherical &quot;drop&quot; of water of radius (depth) x, in free fall, with enough of a &quot;balloon&quot; around it to prevent heat loss and evaporation but not add and &quot;squeeze pressure.&quot; How would pressure change through the pond? How big would it have to be to noticeably influence itself by gravitational effects?

This relies on Hawking knowing that a black hole is not affected by timing of consuming matter, non-electric charge aspects of the matter (such as chemical composition), and all those other dimensions in the input space. How could he have narrowed out all those input variables?

Text: Now that NASA is planning on colonizing the moon, and possibly mars soon, I had a thought that's been lingering in my mind.

Say for example, theoretically. We built a space elavator or just a very long wire that carries data from mars to earth, or just moon to earth, and say it's a perfect cable that has 0 ping.

Relativity states that the more massive an object is, it dilates time around it. So if we go further from the earth say a vaccuum of space such as the moon, there would be time dilation right?

If we set up a skype call using that &quot;data elevator&quot; with the people on the moon or mars, would we see them as they were a few nanoseconds ago? Meaning will there be a noticeable time dilation or does time dilation go out of the question since we're now observing them in real time?

Text: This is a question I've been thinking about for a few months but never really knew who to ask so I'm wondering if this is the right place! 

Obviously aeroplanes are really noisy, and after I've (and im sure everyone else) has been on a flight then for short period of time afterwards my ears feel blocked, my hearing is decreased and i overall feel a bit groggy. It's the same after ive been to any loud event like concerts or whatever. 

On my last few flights ive worn my earbuds which have a noise cancelling feature. i (think) i understand the basic science behind this feature, that the earbuds record whats going on around me and inverts the wavelength then plays it back to me, cancelling out the noise entirely. after this, my ears dont feel blocked at all after a flight 

how is this? i understand i cant actually hear the loud aeroplane noises, but surely the loud wavelengths are still entering my eardrums even if my brains being tricked into thinking theyr not. so does this mean the deafening isnt a result of the actual wavelengths or physics, but is instead neurological cause my brains been too used to loud noises for a period of time and cant understand quiet ones for a bit? i dont understand this at all but its been puzzling me so id love if anyone has an explanation

So, I got to reading about how the moon spins on its axis, but the tidal bulge slowed it's rotation to eventually make it look like it's the same part facing us.  Would that experience be the same on the surface of the moon?  Forgive my ignorance.  My one regret about my education (I'm 48) is that I never took physics or astronomy.  Thank you in advance.

Text: It's a bit of a silly question, but I can't get it off my mind.

I'm putting up some Static cling window films for winter because it reduces heat loss through the glass. The dimensions are roughly about 50x38 inches.

Since I'm not covering the entire window I started wondering which part of it would be where the largest portion of the heat escapes through the window's surface. My intuition tells me it is the upper half, but I'm also not sure if there would be any appreciable difference at that scale. The way modern double-glazed windows are structured to help prevent heat loss also makes me more uncertain if it would work quite that way.

Text: I have a couple of questions about vaccines inspired by the ongoing pandemic:

1. With endemic viruses, whether it be covid-19 or influenza, that we are more or less perpetually “chasing” because they mutate too quickly for vaccines to keep up, would it make sense to use predictive modeling to determine what mutations would most likely be present, say, a year from now, and engineer vaccines based on those predictions? So by using a vaccine that is essentially a cocktail of current and predicted strains, perhaps we could catch up to the virus?

2. Somewhat in line with the first question, how -valent can a vaccine be? I have seen up to 13-valent vaccines just from a cursory Google search, but what is the limit on the number of strains one vaccine could have, and what about the human immune system limits that number?

Text: obligatory excuse my ignorance. 

if an object at rest on earth is lifted to a higher altitude then the kinetic energy required to do so is converted to potential energy? 

so is there a limit to this?

&amp;#x200B;

If an object is lifted higher and higher until it is only negligibly affected by the earth's gravitational field, does the amount of potential energy it gain keep increasing too? 

&amp;#x200B;

Would the voyager probe or some equivalent far off former piece of earth have enormous potential energy?

Text: I've always observed this when looking out of the window on trains and now I started noticing it also shows on other dual-pane windows too but never on normal windows. 

The thing I'm describing is most of the times really subtle, and it can be described as seeing two really close (almost matching) reflections of one random object. One of these two is &quot;shifted&quot; towards a color (e.g. purple) and the other one has its color modified towards the complementary one (in the example, yellow). 

Where the two reflections overlap the color is the same of the object, but as I said they don't fit perfectly and this results in the object having an &quot;aura like&quot; edge (in the example the reflection would show a slightly more purple edge and a yellowish one on the opposite side). 

I know this has something to do with optics and wavelengths but I can't get my head around it. Can someone help me figure it out?

Text: From what I can find, even though it's only used in dire situations, an ECMO machine functions as an external temporary replacement for a heart and lungs. Pumping blood, oxygenating blood, removing carbon dioxide, etc. 

Although it seems rare, patients can be awake and sometimes need to move while connect to the ECMO. 

Since your urge to breathe comes from the build up of carbon dioxide in your blood (carbon dioxide that the ECMO is removing), does this mean a patient on an ECMO doesn't feel the need to breathe or is this an oversimplification?

Text: I thought of this while telling my dog she wouldn’t even know what to do with a piece of molten hot potato that she was begging for.

I remember reading before that the advent of cooking was an inflection point in our evolution, and that we had evolved some traits (e.g. smaller teeth and jaws) likely in response to the change in diet once our food started to come cooked. It got me thinking: if cooked food placed enough evolutionary pressure for “cost-saving” traits like our less beefy chewing muscles, could it have been enough to push something like better responses to thermal burns in order to minimize losing access to food. Surely the risk of being unable to eat is enough of a driver for some change, and the burning risk that comes from a piece of meat fresh out of the fire would be a new environmental aspect that we hadn’t had to deal with before. If enough time has passed that we’ve since been able to evolve other known traits, it seems possible that an improved healing mechanism could also be present compared to other species.

Were Neanderthals ever competing against early humans without the gene change?

1. it's all about the ganos fault (GF) ; a segment in the north anatolian fault (NAF) located in turkey and which is the cause of many earthquakes. The GF was examined using geophysical tools in order to decipher its tectonic evolution, its morphological and structural properties, its fault-fluid relationships. But to obtain comprehensive results they used the magnetotellurics method (it's bc of the fluids in the pores but can u explain me the whole process with a logical structure)

2.There's a topographic map and i don't understand how it works with the geological periods (for example miocene then eocene and alluvium why ?)

3. And finally what is 'dimensionality' and what are 'galvanic distortions' ?

Now let's say this person incurred hearing loss. Let's say that we use some software to raise the volume of the music they're listening on a frequency-specific and hear-specific manner, so that their perceived loudness of the music is the same as before hearing loss occured. This person turns up their music to safe volume, and then the software raises volume.

Would this person hearing be as safe from noise-induced hearing loss as if he had no volume-raising software and no hearing damage? Or would they risk just as much damage as someone with no hearing loss whatsoever?

The book says he discovered this because when he put a mouse on a little stand (so he wouldn't drown) inside a bowl of water, and then covered the mouse and stand with a jar, the water inside the jar rose up above the water outside the jar (I assume they are implying it rose to compensate for the oxygen being used up).

But I would think the CO2 would replace the O2 and there wouldn't be a vacuum situation. 

It is in my Exploring Pearson Textbook for year 8. 

I can't find anything online about this experiment.

Text: 
The question is how can some viruses that aren’t chronic take so long time (Years) for the body to fight off? 

So Virus generally to my understanding are just blindly trying to multiply. Our immune defense is trying to stop this. 
In normal sickness the virus multiplies but after a short while be it a few days or weeks the body’s defense turns the tide and the virus is defeated. The other extreme is the virus goes rampant and then kills the victim as the defenses failed to hold back the virus. 
I understand in chronic cases the virus is able to go dormant and hide to avoid the immune defence to at times wake up and cause a new outbreak. But the outbreaks gets defeated just so the dormant virus isn’t found and exterminated. 
But there are viruses that lasts for a long time where the virus still gets defeated permanently. How come it takes so long time yet never the virus takes totally over or the immune defense does? Is it a long time of “stalemate” where the replication of virus is about as large as the immune defence can keep up killing it, causing a “stable” state. Take HPV warts for example. They have strains that aren’t “permanent” but can take years before fought off. 

Is some of my understanding wrong or how come it take so long? What happens after years that suddenly tips the tide? And how come if it isn’t defeated before then it doesn’t spread more? Like I’m case of HPV to all skin cells?

What I am not sure of is I always hear talk of modern humans interbreeding with Neanderthals and Denisovans once they migrated to these places. My question is did the Netherlands lineage already live in Europe and Asia and evolve there? If so where did they come from? When did they get there? If they were able  to breed together  we must be related somewhere in our history. And if Neanderthals evolved from modern humans does that mean they were the first wave to leave Africa before becoming what we deem as their own species?

Text: I’m talking about elements like Copper and Ruthenium. Following the Aufbau principle, you expect the 4s orbital to be filled before the 3d orbital. However, Cu has the configuration [Ar] 4s1 3d10 instead of [Ar] 4s2 3d9. I can somewhat understand that a full d-orbital can somehow be preferred, since the total spin stays the same (first rule of Hund), even though the second rule of Hund is not followed. But where I am completely lost is with elements like ruthenium ([Kr] 5s1 4d7), where Hunds rules are completely ignored and the removed second 5s electron doesn’t contribute to a fully filled d-orbital. 

I want to understand why this is the case. I get that they’re somehow lower in energy, but I want to understand why. My search in old studybooks and internet did not help, even my old university prof doesn’t know.

So my question is: how is it that some elements have unexpected electron configurations, and why?

EDIT: copper instead of chromium

Text: I've noticed lately that when I walk through the city, I can often see four species of corvids at the same time- magpies, hooded crows, rooks and jackdaws, often just within few dozen meters from each other.

There is a lot of bird species around, but they usually have their own things - some keep to water, some to parks or some wild areas, they have different beaks, diets etc. I would guess pigeons are wildly successful because they eat anything and reproduce a lot. They did push out sparrows out of the city in the last 20-30 years (though I understand there were other factors as well, like pollution).

But those city corvids have very similar diets, they're all very intelligent- how do they occupy the same space without one species dominating their niche and pushing others away? Why isn't the biggest one, or the smartest one, or the most cooperative winning? Or maybe they are more different than I think?

Text: Is there any material capable of forming a surface that is not just opaque or translucent to gamma radiation, but capable of specular reflection, even of perpendicular radiation? How high can the reflectivity get?

EDIT: Can't find reflection per se, but I found something about refraction. It looks like [in 2012 someone at the Max Planck Institute succeeded in building gold lenses?](https://scitechdaily.com/high-energy-radiation-is-refracted-setting-the-stage-for-gamma-optics/)

&gt; Scientists at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich and the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching have opened up a new chapter in optics: in experiments with gamma rays at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble they have proven that these extremely high-energy electromagnetic waves can be focused by lenses like conventional light — the researchers have thus refuted a fundamental assumption of theoretical physics that had been valid for decades. Their discovery will make a great many new applications possible in medicine and materials research, for example.  
&gt; Optical instruments like telescopes and microscopes are based on the refraction of light: in a medium such as glass the electromagnetic waves propagate more slowly than in air or in a vacuum, and are therefore diffracted — for example, onto the focal plane of a photo camera. The refractive index, which depends on the lens material and the frequency of the waves, describes how large this effect is: the more it deviates from 1, the stronger the diffraction of the light beams.  
&gt; Until now, physicists had assumed that electromagnetic radiation with far greater energy than that in the visible spectrum could not be diffracted with lenses. They had calculated that the refractive index in this region of the spectrum is almost precisely 1 for all materials. **However, back in the mid-1990s it turned out that X-rays are also diffracted by beryllium or carbon lenses, and thus that X-ray optics were possible.**  
&gt; When Dietrich Habs, professor at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich and Fellow of the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching, and his team were making their measurements at the ILL they discovered that this also applies to the even higher energy gamma-rays — after X-ray optics, the era of gamma optics is now beginning.

TIL [X-Ray Optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_optics) appear to have been a thing for a while, including [mirrors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_optics#Mirrors_for_X-ray_optics).

Text: The way I understand it, the SRY gene is found on the Y chromosome, and it encodes for TDF. This, in turn, leads to prenatal testosterone and AMH. The prenatal testosterone lead to the development of the male reproductive system from the Wolffian duct while AMH leads to the disintegration of the Mullerian duct. Conversely, if there is no Y chromosome and no upsurge of testosterone or presence of AMH, the Wolffian duct disintegrates while the Mullerian duct develops into the female reproductive tract.

In that case, it seems like people with XO genotypes have no Y chromosome = no TDF = no AMH/high levels of T, so they should develop ovaries. What am I missing?

Text: Cat’s most active times are during dawn and dusk but I notice when cats sleep during the day, they’ll often cover their eyes. It made me curious what kind of neurochemistry triggers cats sleeping habits. If they cover their eyes to release melatonin that wouldn’t normally occur during the day.

Text: Playing some kids’ geometric puzzle pieces (and then doing some pencil &amp; paper checks), I realized something.

It started like this: I can line up a sequence of pentagons and equilateral triangles, end-to-end, and get a cycle (a segmented circle). There are 30 shapes in this cycle (15 pentagon-triangle pairs), and so the perimeter of the cycle is divided then into 30 equal straight segments.

[Here is a figure to show what i'm talking about] (https://imgur.com/NfXtoDK)

You can do something similar with squares and triangles and you get a smaller cycle: 6 square-pentagon pairs, dividing the perimeter into 12 segments.

And then you can just build it with triangles - basically you just get a hexagon with six sides.

For regular polygons beyond the pentagon, it changes. Hexagons and triangles gets you a straight line (actually, you *can* get a cycle out of these, but it isn't of segments like all the others). Then, you get cycles bending in the opposite direction with 8-, 9-, 12-, 15-, and 24-gons. For those, respectively, the perimeter (now the ‘inner’ boundary of the pattern - see the figure above for an example) is divided into 24, 18, 12, 10, and 8 segments.

You can also make cycles with some polygons on their own: triangles, squares, hexagons (three hexagons in sequence make a cycle), and you can do it a couple of ways with octagons (with four or eight). You can also make cycles with some other combinations (e.g. 10(*edited from 5*) pentagon-square pairs).

Here’s what I realized:
The least common multiple of those numbers (the number of segments to the perimeter of the triangle-polygon circle) is *360*! (at least, I’m pretty sure of it.. maybe here I have made a mistake).

This means that if you lay all those cycles on a common circle, and if you want to subdivide the circle in such a way as to catch the edges of every segment, you need 360 subdivisions.

Am I just doing some kind of circular-reasoning numerology here or is this maybe a part of the long-lost rationale for the division of the circle into 360 degrees? The wikipedia article claims it’s not known for certain but seems weighted for a “it’s close to the # of days in the year” explanation, and also nods to the fact that 360 is such a *convenient* number (can be divided lots and lots of ways - which seems related to what I noticed). Surely I am not the first discoverer of this pattern.. in fact this seems like something that would have been easy for an ancient Mesopotamian to discover..

*
*
*edit for tldr*
*
*

For those who don't understand the explanation above (i sympathize): to be clear, this method gets you exactly 360 subdivisions of a circle *but it has nothing to do with choice of units*. *It's a coincidence*, not a tautology, as some people are suggesting.. I thought it was an interesting coincidence because the method relies on constructing circles (or cycles) out of elementary geometrical objects (regular polyhedra).


The most common response below is basically what wikipedia says (i.e. common knowledge); 360 is a highly composite number, divisible by the Babylonian 60, and is close to the number of days in the year, so that probably is why the number was originally chosen. But I already recognized these points in my original post.. what I want to know is whether or not this **coincidence** has been noted before or proposed as a possible method for how the B's came up with &quot;360&quot;, *even if it's probably not true*.

Thanks!

If the Milky Way is a pizza, how far from the edge is Sol? How far from the plate is Sol?

Further, can we draw a hard line and say that this is where the Milky Way ends?

Text: I saw an article by researchers from the Max-Planck-Institute about brain structure and connectivity changes associated with pornography consumption recently and found it had rather drastic seeming implications for the caudate in that consuming porn could be responsible for just shrinking its gray matter ([https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1874574](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1874574)). 

Now, having been in that age, and made use of the stimulation from that type of media rather often (in the past, of course), this seems kind of relevant and concerning for me. So I've come here to ask: 

Does gray matter in general or at least in specific regions of the brain including the caudate regenerate after it's shrunk through the kind of effects porn consumption appears to have on it or is it most likely just going to be lost for good because of it?

Text: Say Juliet wins two state lotteries back to back in 1999.

A person who thinks it was rigged might say &quot;Well, the probability of her winning two state lotteries back to back is infinitesimally low. Therefore she probably rigged it.&quot;

A person who looks at the broader scope of lotteries might say &quot;Well, the probability of someone winning two state lotteries at some time is much higher. This is explainable by chance and the lottery being rigged isn't necessary.&quot;

The second is a logically weaker description of the first. It &quot;seems&quot; more correct, but is it? What is the justification for it? Many would say that the second description seems more relevant, but why? Why is it exactly more relevant?

Curiously, one can construct logically stronger and logically weaker versions of the same exact sequence of events, and yet...each would have wildly different probabilities. For example, these descriptions go from logically strong to logically weak:

1. What is the probability that Juliet decided to play two New Jersey state lotteries, won two state lotteries, and won it at 9 PM? (assuming it was announced then)
2. What is the probability that Juliet won two New Jersey state lotteries?
3. What is the probability that Juliet won two state lotteries?
4. What is the probability that someone won two state lotteries?
5. What is the probability that someone won two lotteries?
6. What is the probability that some rare meaningful event in the world occurs?
7. What is the probability that an event occurs?

The last statement almost seems like a tautology, and yet, can one come up with a satisfactory answer as to why it's not relevant here? Which description is most relevant?

Text: I understand that the pressure in the boundary layer (BL) changes with respect to x and so we have dP/dz=0. Where x is streamwise, y is spanwise, and z is wall-normal. According to my professor, the centripetal acceleration from curvature balances out the pressure gradient, dP/dx=v^(2)/r. In the BL, the velocity decreases at the surface, so the radius of curvature must reduce to compensate for this. This leads to tighter curvature. Is it this smaller curvature that allows pressure to bend the streamline flow to spawn crossflow?

I've heard off-hand mention of fungi in our guts being native to that ecosystem, but I can't find anything describing them as beneficial besides &quot;promoting immune system development&quot;. Yeah, that would technically be beneficial, but it's nowhere near as important as mycorrhyzae or other cross-kingdom relationships like coral and algae, spotted salamanders and their algae, and the tons of bacterial-animal relationships.

TLDR: Are fungi and animals just not compatible or did I miss an example? If they aren't compatible, why are fungi cool with plants?

PS: I'm specifically asking about fungi living in/on animals in a literally inseperable relationship. Farmed fungi, like those associated with leaf cutter ants, or fungi that use animals animals as spore dispersers, such as stinkhorns, don't count.

Text: Was there anything special about how NASA designed DART to get the most efficient energy transfer when crashing into Dimorphos? For example, if they put more mass in the front (impacting side) of the spacecraft then I would assume it would transfer more energy into the asteroid. This is because there would be less absorption of energy as it crunches during the impact. But if they put more mass in the rear side then they would lose some energy as it accordions before the rear comes into contact.

Or does this even makes sense to take into consideration because of how fast DART was flying/it being just a proof of concept?

Text: So I can recall several times in which my GP has highlighted the fact that for a virus such as the flu or the common cold, you just need to let your defences take the wheel and fight it off. For cases in which the body has to fight a bacterial infection (pharyngitis - strep throat) and in which you typically are prescribed antibiotics...I wonder if you don't go through such treatment whether the immune system is capable to fight off the infection with the same effectiveness as when fighting a virus.

Apologies if it's a silly question, I come from a culture and age in which antibiotics were prescribed too easily IMO. 

Thanks!

The case is that, if it landed at the North Pole or the South Pole, the global after-impact effects such as gases and dust spreading through the atmosphere, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanism and massive forest fires would be minimized, could become more regional.

I have recently learned, however, that the Oklo natural fission reactor is known to have at one time produced elements as heavy as Fermium. When the phrase &quot;heaviest natural element&quot; is used, how exact is that statement? Is there an atomic weight where it is theoretically impossible for a single atom to have once existed? For example, is there no possible scenario in which a single atom of Rutherfordium once existed without human intervention? If this is the case, what is the limiting factor? If not, is it simply the fact that increasing weights after uranium are EXTREMELY unlikely to form, but it is possible that trace amounts have come into existence in the last 14 billion years?

Text: Earth's water - a finite resource - moves in and out of lakes, rivers, and the ocean. How does the location and amount of water in Earth's water bodies change over time, particularly in a warming climate? The upcoming [SWOT](https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/overview/) (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) mission plans to find out.

The SUV-size satellite will measure the height of Earth's salt and fresh water around the world, [track regional shifts in sea level](https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/news/66/international-satellite-to-track-impacts-of-small-ocean-currents/) at scales never seen before, and make NASA's first truly [global survey of the planet's fresh water](https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/news/68/us-european-satellite-will-make-worlds-first-global-freshwater-survey/).

By tracking water around the world, SWOT will help us manage water resources and make decisions in communities affected by sea level rise and climate change.

SWOT is scheduled for launch in December. It is a collaboration between NASA and the French space agency Centre National d'Études Spatiales (CNES), with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency and the UK Space Agency.

We are:

+ **Eva Peral (EP)**, Systems Engineer, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
+ **Margaret Srinivasan (MS)**, SWOT Applications Lead, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
+ **Cedric David (CD)**, Hydrologist, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
+ **Ben Hamlington (BH)**, Oceanographer, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory

Ask us anything, including:

+ How SWOT can help communities manage water resources
+ What SWOT can tell us about the ocean's role in climate change
+ The engineering behind SWOT's main instrument, the Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn)
+ How SWOT will monitor fresh water sources like lakes, rivers, and reservoirs

Text: Suppose you have a hydrogen atom, and you fire photons at it. Assuming you can control the frequency (and hence the energy) of the photon, you can theoretically send a photon of any arbitrary energy towards the atom. Let's say that the energy required to excite the electron from the 1s state to 2s is 1. (Some arbitrary units) And the energy to from 2s to 2p is 0.5 in the same units. Now if I fire a photon of 1.4 energy units, where does the extra 0.4 energy go? There's no further sub quanta of energy it can excite the electron to. Does that mean that such a photon will never be absorbed by the atom? Is there some non quantized sink of energy it can go to, like the kinetic energy of the atom or something like that?

Text: Yesterday I listened to a historian who talked about the Goths. At the beginning he talked about that they don't know much about the beginning of the Goths but that they expect that they lived in what now is Poland. Why they expect that was due to signs of a similar culture found there.
He showed 1 example of such signs, it was a ring of stones (like Stonehenge but way smaller and not stacked) in a forest. The stones were around 0,5m tall and probably artificially rounded on the top.
Afterwards I asked how they know how old those stones are, but he couldn't answer my question.

So that's my question to you. How do they know when those stones were placed there? Because you can't just use the age of the stones, they are way older. Can they find that date from the chipping done in the stones? Or maybe the change in the soil? Or is there something else that is more easy to date found nearby?

Text: Ive been doing a lot of research in regards to this but can't seem to get or even understand the mechanism.

According to Davies et al.:&lt;&lt; *The npr-1 signaling pathway may act by presynaptic inhibition and could therefore alter transmitter release at the same sites as the SLO-1 channel. Mutations in the slo-1 gene, which confer considerably more (up to 2.5 times) ethanol resistance than null alleles of npr-1, have serious phenotypic consequences that would be likely to compromise fitness of animals carrying them. In contrast, allelic variation in genes like npr-1 may have more subtle alterations in transmitter release, and therefore may be more easily maintained in wild populations. Such allelic variation may have major phenotypic consequences when animals are exposed to ethanol*. &gt;&gt; 

But I don't exactly know what this means

Text: Surplus killing is  defined as animals /predators killing more prey than is necessary. The reasoning for their behaviour is that animals can also kill for fun rather than just for survival. Is this really true or are we just anthropomorphising its behaviour?

If this is true, is it problematic since humans are mammals and the thrill for killing is programmed into us?

Text: To my understanding the energy that goes into an appliance plugged into your wall is lost in the form of heat and light (which eventually bounces around your room enough times to also become heat).

Does this mean that any appliance that produces heat as a byproduct is equally efficient as an electric space heater?

Does this mean running a PC in a thermostat heated room is essentially free, on account of the heat from the PC meaning the space heater has to run less?

If this isn't the case, then where does the excess energy from the appliance go, if not into the room the appliance is in?

This dumb question brought to you by, me fussing about energy bills this winter! Also a bit of natural curiosity since no answer feels obvious in an intuitive sense to me.

Text: All other things being equal, adding weight/moving weight lower on the club head is said to increase the launch angle of the ball. But why? Shouldn't it just be the face angle? I read an article that said that the head would pivot during the impact, with the lower center of gravity moving beneath the center of gravity of the ball, thus resulting in a higher launch angle because the face angle changed?

I'm not sure I understand correctly. I watched a slo mo videos of several shots and I couldn't see what they were saying, though it was clear in nearly every case that the ball always left the face on a greater angle than the face itself was pointing.

Is it something to do with spin/roll during the collision? Or something about the offset center of gravities and equal and opposite reactions?

Text: The question is simple, but the answer is difficult.

If you have a neutron in, say, a helium atom... that neutron is stable for billions of years.

Contrast this with a free neutron, which has a half life estimated to be somewhere between 10 and 15 minutes. Free neutrons decay into a proton, an electron and a gamma ray (and an antineutrino or something like that?)

So what is it that makes such a huge difference in the stability of neutrons (in a nucleus vs free)?

Text: I have an informational calendar that for the month of October reads: &quot;Insects are an ancient group of organisms: they first evolved around 450 million years ago.&quot;

I feel like I see this phrasing a lot, where some organism is described as having evolved circa a specific time in the past. But evolution isn't an event, it's a process that's constantly ongoing, and I've always felt this kind of wording implies, in this example, &quot;and then suddenly there were insects&quot;. 

Would it be more appropriate to say that this is the time period for which we have the oldest evidence of the existence of what most people would recognize as an insect? Is it a period of unusually rapid change where the ancestors of insects began to acquire features that we consider insects to have, like exoskeletons, multiple limbs, antennae, whatever? Or something else entirely?

And, related, if any science educators or evolutionary biologists find themselves weighing in here, are there better ways to convey this information? Evolution is a very complex topic that's by no mean easy to reduce to packets of digestible knowledge, but in the interest of scientific literacy it feels like this kind of phrasing does a disservice to what the concept of evolution attempts to describe.

After eliminating other possibilities, I'm left with the hypothesis that my soundbar is producing some annoying or frightening noise in some ultrasonic frequency — a frequency that I can't hear, but my cat can. (I'd like to find out for sure, but ultrasound microphones are apparently expensive, and I'm not sure how to capture the audio coming from one.)

Do many electronic or mechanical devices produce incidental operational vibrations at ultrasonic frequencies? If we could hear these higher frequencies, would our constructed environments — cities especially — seem especially &quot;noisy&quot; in these frequencies? Are there any product standards or government regulations intended to limit ultrasonic &quot;noise pollution&quot;?

Do they serve a purpose in the sick/healing process? Or are they just a painful reaction to the sickness?

Text: I've read a few things recently about dolphin communications following the same patterns as human language with respect to Zipf's law.  I have no idea what that means and it's hard for me to parse Wikipedia's explanation--by my reading, it seems like that's about ordering data in sets rather than the relationships between days points, but I'm pretty sure I'm not understanding.

I just want someone to tell me how excited I should be about implications of universal laws of language being verified (or not).  Thanks!

Or put another way, do subatomic particles experience collision/volume like mass at a macroscopic scale (or does another force provide a similar property)? My understanding is that collision as we experience it is a result of electromagnetic forces.

Is there some good reason this can't be done, or has it just not happened because nobody's bothered doing it yet? Surely the population can't be so unstable that at least one or two cocoons can't be safely taken to another site and raised there?

Text: I’ve been putting something together that should graphically represent what an expanded human vision would look like, and while I have one axis (visible spectrum of 380nm to 700nm in wavelength) I’m not sure where the other axis falls, let alone how to directly convert lux to (W/m^2).  The closest I can find is [these](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01351-4) two [articles,](https://www.nature.com/articles/154013c0) with the second giving a minimum vision that seems equivalent to X-rays using the math I have.  Even the conventional range of lux (100 microlux to 100 Kilolux) doesn’t feel like it’s expansive enough because it’s constrained to sunlight.

Edit: It specifically doesn’t feel sufficient because we can see stars in the night sky, as per the [lux definition.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux#Illuminance) the maximum is also too low because surfaces under the sun aren’t blinding.

I can't find anywhere if these 3-quarter of a lion are fertile. Since there has been only a small number of these animals maybe none of them happened to bear or sir offsprings (plus these hybridations are seen as unethical in the first place), but could we know theoretically?

Text: I understand how and why ocean waves form, how different frequencies emerge from storms and how the shorter period ones die out as the larger/longer ones eventually can move across entire oceans with relatively little loss in energy. I have a decent understanding of certain types of waves and their dynamics as I studied engineering in school, and have also been an avid surfer for twenty years.

However, I've searched online numerous times for an explanation as to **WHY** or **HOW** ocean waves group into sets, rather than simply remaining as a uniform train of similar waves, and nobody seems to ever explain the mechanisms behind it. They simply mention that it happens, and move on.

An astrophysicist friend once explained acoustic resonance to me as his guess to a possible reason, which seemed to have something to it, but I truly have no idea. My latest search's top result yielded &quot;large period waves combine with local short period waves to form these groups&quot; which is complete BS. I've also seen someone write that wind gusts are responsible, which doesn't seem accurate either.

Does anybody have a way of explaining this phenomenon?

For example, I have found out that DSCOVR measures magnetic field readings as well as solar wind density and speed, but what does this data tell us about severity and impacts on Earth? 

Are high solar wind speeds more disruptive than low ones? Or does it have to do with more density? What fluctuations in magnetic field readings indicate unusual sun activity?

How do these things come together in a forecast? Is it easy to use that data to understand space weather, or do you need to process it heavily to forecast?

Text: I'm not sure if I worded the question appropriately, but what I'm actually asking about is how the process that &quot;determines&quot; how an individual atom reacts chemically is works (to the extent that we know). I understand that the proton count is just set definitionally, but I'm asking to what extent we're aware of the actual changes that cause chemical property shifts in individual atoms. A lot of the answers (including one in this sub) were unsatisfactory, as they all deal with why it is defined that way and not the underlying process that leads it to be. More simply (maybe?), what is the *explanation* for the correlation between protons and chemical properties?

Text: Take for example

 2 H² + O² -&gt; 2 H²O

This is a combustion, so there's energy being released, and whenever there's energy coming from matter, I'd assume E = mc² comes into play.

But from what I've learned in school, and also the result I get when I try googling this problem, is that the mass *does not* change at all, and it makes sense, if you put 4 mol of hydrogen and 2 mol of oxygen in, you'd expect the same amount out with their respective masses.

But if that's the case, where does the energy released come from? Is that some sort of potential energy I'm not aware about?

But I was taught that waves (of the same type) interfere with each other when they meet. Seeing as light is also just an electromagnetic wave, it should also interefere with any wireless signal, thus altering the signal, making it impossible to decode correctly. This should, as I understand it, happen with literally every single wireless signal in a given area, creating a giant jumbled mess that would end up giving noone any of the things they were using their wireless signal for. Am I fundamentally misunderstanding something here? I am genuinely confused.

I assume it's possible for a person to subject particles to these forces so as to collapse the particle down to one state without gaining any knowledge about the particle. For example, by not looking at the monitor or not recording the measurement made by the device. Is that the case? 

Is there any theoretical way of measuring these objects through different means which do not subject the particles to such forces?

Or is their state inextricably linked to an observer's knowledge about them?

That's how craters form as far as I know, so if NASA can alter the trajectory of a much larger body with a much smaller impact, why didn't this crater cause this Moon to leave Jupiter's orbit? What's keeping the Earth from sliding out of orbit around the sun the more often we launch spacecraft from it? Isn't every tiny force against the earth moving it out of its orbit? Because of the relationship of objects in a gravity well aren't we moving the Sun and potentially destabilizing that too, however an insignificant amount? Could many years of spaceships launching from the same place on Earth at the same time of year/day/force angle cause it to lose its stable orbit? Eventually?

Text: I'm curious if there’s anything (food safe of course) that you can add to a bottled drink that will lower the freezing point. Ideally, it would have a minimal effect on the taste.

I know salt will. What else?

EDIT:  I saw a reply in my email that doesn't seem to appear here.  Someone mentioned that it could be dangerous to drink a liquid that was below the freezing point of water because it could cause body parts to freeze.  I am looking for a modest decrease in freezing point, around 10-20F below the normal freezing point which shouldn't be much more dangerous than drinking an alcoholic drink that's below 32F or chewing ice.

The purpose of this inquiry is to make a sports drink that could be kept liquid below 32F

Text: Hi Reddit! We are Simone Li (/u/simone_s_li), Sebastian Schmidt (/u/TSBSchm), Nicolai Karcher (/u/YummyYam123) and Daniel Podlesny (/u/DanielPodlesny). We are lead authors on three independent, recently published studies on microbiome dynamics following fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT, aka stool transplants). Ask Us Anything!

An FMT is the transfer of stool from a donor to a recipient, usually to improve the recipient's health. FMTs are an increasingly popular intervention in different diseases, ranging from recurrent infection with C. difficile (where clinical success rates are &gt;90%) all the way to autism. Yet while FMTs seem to &quot;work&quot; well in some people and diseases, clinical effects are meagre in others and the reasons for this remain very incompletely understood. For a broader introduction to FMT, check out wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_microbiota_transplant.

As FMT targets the gut microbiome, it is generally thought that clinical success depends on the successful engraftment of &quot;good&quot; microbes from the donor and decolonization of &quot;bad&quot; microbes from the recipient. However, what really happens to the microbiome following an FMT, and whether outcomes can be predicted in advance (for example, to pick suitable donors for every recipient) has remained unclear. We represent three independent research teams who tackled this problem by analysing data from several independent trials where FMTs were conducted for different diseases: we used metagenomic data (i.e. DNA sequences directly from stool samples) to track microbes between donors and recipients. We developed models to predict whether donor microbes would colonize or recipient microbes persist after the intervention, and we used this information to pinpoint the factors that determine these outcomes. Broadly speaking, all three teams made similar observations: microbiome dynamics after FMT were somewhat predictable, and there is a limited list of factors that drive outcomes - most of them are on the recipient's side, meaning that choice of a &quot;matching&quot; donor seems less relevant than previously thought.

If for example the subject knowing the truth would impact or impede the &quot;honesty&quot; of the results, would that be allowed? I obviously don't mean keeping subjects in the dark or avoiding revealing certain things. As an example, if a study was aiming to see reactions to sounds/images of people in pain, would they be allowed to say to a subject that what they were seeing is real and only reveal later that the images/sounds/videos were faked? Or is this an ethical violation?

Text: Just by doing some basic comparisons and looking at high level trends a somewhat obvious (albeit not immediately validated) hypothesis seems to form itself…

yDNA Haplogroup G seems to have originated around the Caucasus region (where the highest diversity and rates of G are found today).

It is also home to the kartvelian language family, seemingly a final bastion from the spread of indo European and Turkic languages. A language family not known to be directly connected to any others, but influenced by indo European.


Since the spread of yDNA G, especially G2a is associated with the spread of farming in Europe and west Asia, it stands to reason that the kartvelian languages could be an offshoot descendant of a larger, older early farmer language family. Possibly similar enough to what the early European farmers would have spoken.

I can’t find anything on this in literature, Wikipedia etc but this seems a somewhat obvious subject to investigate?

I’m interested to hear if anyone knows if this has been proposed in the past or looked into.

Thanks!

My research has been concerned with how to safely stop psychiatric medications based on understanding their effects on the brain - and the technique I have developed, called [hyperbolic tapering](https://www.thelancet.com/article/S2215-0366(19)30032-X/fulltext), has been adopted as [guidance](https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mental-health/treatments-and-wellbeing/stopping-antidepressants) for the public by the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the UK. This research came out of my own awful experience coming off antidepressants. I run a clinic in the public health service in London to help people safely stop psychiatric drugs for anxiety and depression and find that many people who could not stop their medication in the 'old-fashioned' ways are able to do so safely in my clinic, now supported by studies using similar techniques.

I am also a co-author of the recent umbrella review assessing the validity of the serotonin hypothesis ('chemical imbalance') in depression, published in [Molecular Psychiatry](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01661-0). While many psychiatrists say this is old news, research suggests that over 80% of the public still believe in the chemical imbalance theory, and many companies and healthcare bodies still promote it on their websites.

In North America, I have co-founded a company called [Outro Health](https://www.outro.health/), which brings this gradual, supported and hyperbolic approach to people in Canada and the US, so that people will have the support they need (and which I did not have!). I will be on at 12pm US EST (16 UT) for 3 hours. AMA!

This lead to the question of whether or not the amount of water in your system can effect how much caffeine you absorb from coffee. I looked it up and besides the mass of articles saying coffee dehydrated you, I only found one source that was kinda close which said that if you're more hydrated when you drink coffee you'll get better effects from the caffeine, and another article saying that drinking a lot of water will help flush your system of caffeine. The only remotely close article was written 6 years ago and lacks any medical sources.
I'm just a barista with a very basic understanding of how caffeine effects the body, mostly through my own experience. The somewhat contradictory information isn't very helpful and I was wondering if there was anyone who knows this stuff who could help me out.

Even though the yearly flu shot [reduces infections, decreases hospitalizations and prevents thousands of deaths](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/vaccineeffect.htm), there is clearly more work to be done. Further complicating things is that many of the typical symptoms of flu overlap with symptoms of COVID-19, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection and the common cold.

Join us today at 2 PM ET (19 UT) for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), about seasonal and pandemic influenza. We'll answer your questions about why we need a different flu shot every year, talk about the process of identifying, making and delivering the flu vaccine, and discuss strategies for minimizing (and hopefully preventing) the spread of influenza.

Text: i understand that the uud structure of the proton is the lowest allowed energy state of three quarks, and thus it can't decay (supersymmetric theories aside). the neutron, meanwhile, is udd and can (when by itself, or in the right kind of nucleus) undergo beta decay to a proton via spontaneous emission of a massive, charged W boson.

furthermore, i understand that for instance non-spontaneous fission occurs when a neutron of sufficient energy interacts with the nucleus, bringing it to an unstable energy level. u235 is close to this level, and thus fissions when interacting with a neutron of even thermal energy, whereas u238 needs a higher-energy neutron to fission. high-energy photons can furthermore knock nucleons out in photodisintegration.

2.78MeV differentiate the up and down quark. This energy ought be readily available; the excited Ni60 metastate decays with a 1.33MeV γ, about half this value. Why don't we see protons transmuting to neutrons when such gamma rays hit them, especially in e.g. a plasma where there are no electrons to get in the way (at nuclear distance scales)?

sorry, i am merely a dumb computer scientist.

But if an invertebrate suffers a break in their exoskeleton, does it seal the way our skin can? Or does everything leak out? For segmented species, are the segments sealed off from each other to prevent that? 

Since they have no skin with sensing nerves, do they register pain the same way we do? Do they bruise? Can they suffer the equivalent of sprained or torn muscles or ligaments, and can they heal from that? If so, how?

Text: I am not a physicist, but am having to brush up on my understanding of magnetism for my biology undergraduate thesis. Thanks in advance for hearing me out:

I am trying to establish **whether a paramagnetic salt** (manganese II chloride) **maintains its paramagnetism when dissolved in a polar, aqueous solution** (at which point, it is assumed that it would dissociate into its constituent ions). In a moment of redneck engineering, we placed a small bar magnet on the side of the manganese II chloride saturated solution, to see whether the ions would re-orient themselves in response to this applied field. **No change was observed in response to this applied field.**

I have a few questions that I'm stumped on:

**1. Does the fraction of lone pair electrons in a paramagnetic substance change dependent on the strength of an applied magnetic field?**

**2. Does the speed at which the electrons relocalize change in response to the magnitude of the applied magnetic field?** (ie. maybe we just didn't wait long enough to observe the change)

**3. If a polar aqueous solution caused the salt to lose its paramagnetism, then would a non-polar aqueous solution allow for paramagnetic retention? Is there a way to test for either of these?**

Text: Since I'm not any versed in neuroscience. I have read that there are some methods where which the brain tries to functionally recover. This involves neurogenesis and neuroplasticity.

From my understanding, with not as much research, neurogenesis isn't going to replace damaged cells, but it will help functionally promote more cells of the damage brain in places like the hippocampus and the amygdala. Neuroplasticity is when the brain rewires where the damaged brain function is to another part of the brain to get it to work properly. Maybe a section of one side of the hippocampus isn't functioning properly, that hippocampus function might be rewired to the other one or another part of the brain entirely.

Are smokers’ children more likely to have a worse sense of smell or no sense of smell?

Are smokers’ children more likely to be infected with typical viruses that go under the “common cold” term?

Text: I think my question stems from a misunderstanding of the balancing act nuclear reactors play. My understanding is that prompt neutrons comprise of almost all neutrons produced in a reactor (&gt;99%), while delayed neutrons provide the rest (&lt;1%). Due to how quickly prompt neutrons are created (on the order of a few nano seconds), reaching prompt criticality results in a dangerous power excursion too fast to control for. Therefore, we keep the reactor just under prompt criticality and have the delayed neutrons provide the rest to reach criticality and therefore a sustained chain reaction (prompt sub-critical and delayed critical).

So, let's say a reactor is currently in this balancing act and has reached a sustained/controlled reaction and is producing 1000MW. The electricity demand has gone up and now the power plant wants to increase power to 1500MW. How is this possible without tipping over the already very fine balancing act into prompt criticality? Put another way, how can a reactor have a dynamic power output when increasing or decreasing power by a significant amount means either a power excursion or fizzling out?

1. Why are kinase inhibitors often so unspecific?
2. When  targeting a cytosolic protein to the ER, what needs to be considered in  terms of getting to the ER, staying there, modifications, calcium, redox?

Text: I've been trying to delve deeper into chemistry &amp; physics lately and one thing I've learned about is electromagnetism and strong force. To my current understanding protons, and generally things with opposing charges, repel one another. This alone would cause protons to fly away from one another until nuclear strong force comes in. If I'm not mistaken nuclear strong force is the force between particles in a nucleus that allows them to be bound together, all particles have this property but neutrons to protons is the most important example as it allows a neutron to bind to two protons effectively holding the two together. My subsequent question is then obvious, if particles bind to each other and the neutral force of a neutron means there's no electromagnetic force separating them why don't massive amounts of neutrons accumulate among each other over time creating a mega neutron ball?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm assuming that this question also relates to another question of mine that being &quot;why can't I just bombard unstable isotopes of massive atoms such as oganesson with neutrons until the strong force granted by them eventually overpowers the immense electromagnetic force of all the protons.&quot; As they're both the same question of why doesn't infinitely adding neutrons to a nucleus make it infinitely more stable.

Text: Reading the Blind Watchmaker, I came across this paragraph which put me thinking.

&quot;Could the human eye have arisen directly from something slightly different from itself, something that we may call X?

If the answer to this question for any particular degree of difference is no, all we have to do is repeat the question for a smaller degree of difference. Carry on doing this until we find a degree of difference sufficiently small to give us a ‘yes’ answer.&quot;

My doubt is simply: if this degree of difference becomes so insignificantly small, could natural selection still &quot;distinguish&quot; between such minimal fitness in order to select for it?

Or is it that, on average, even such a small degree of difference is enough to propagate over time through natural selection, provided there is at least a minimal increase in fitness?

Text: We're the Auto Terra Project, one of the top 25 teams in the US competing in the NASA Deep Space Food Challenge, a competition to create the Mars habitat food production system.  This system will be used to feed the astronauts at every step of the mission.  You'll see us listed on their website as the Arrakis Terrarium Project, as we recently rebranded: https://www.deepspacefoodchallenge.org/teams

Our solution centers around enclosed ecosystems!  Think of a 4 foot by 4 foot by 26 inch (1.2 meters by 1.2 meters by 0.66 meters) climate-controlled community garden plot in a box, complete with a water cycle, lights, temperature control, humidity control, sensor data, and more.  The internals are separate from the externals, meaning that the plants have an ideal environment despite what's going on outside.  We have proof of concept, and if you would like to see our prototype, some of our harvest, and our work, feel free to check out our website: https://autoterraproject.co/

We would also like to someday use our devices to strengthen food security on Earth by partnering with nonprofits to put these into the homes of people in need.  The devices require 0 daily maintenance and allow the users to access fresh foods whenever needed, without having to worry about supply lines, costs in grocery stores, or transportation.

If you'd like to support us, the biggest thing you can do is to get on our website and sign up to our email list!  It'll help us show others that our project is important and aid us in getting additional funding to continue our work.

The people answering questions from our team include:

+ **Ariel Shramko** (/u/ATPSpaceFood) the environmental engineer on the team.  They create the criteria for the ecosystem, create the ecosystem itself, monitor the health of the units, and complete some of the chemical engineering within the project as well.
+ **Eliot Pirone** (/u/Necessary_Ad_126) the mechanical engineer behind the physical design of the project.  If Ariel determines what the units need to do to maintain healthy environments for the plants and changes the living matter within the ecosystems, Eliot figures out how to make that happen.

The team will begin answering questions at 12pm EST (17 UT). Thanks for listening, AUA!

If a chemical is light but has a high flash point, and visa versa, what would that mean for diffusion?

How do they differentiate one from another? How does a neuron differentiates itself from a blood cell? Or a muscular cell? Or any cell? And if possible, how's the exact process?

So what I'm wondering is whether differences in the folds among individuals of a same species indicate differences in IQ.

Text: I saw a picture of a refrigerator that had floated and flipped over during the recent hurricane. My dad said he was surprised it would float away, particularly cause the  heavy mechanicals are at the bottom of the refrigerator, but i told him i dont think thats relevant.

So heres the hypothetical scenario. We have two refrigerator sized prisms standing side by side and the water level is steadily rising. Object A has a big lead weight sitting inside, at the bottom, while object B has the same lead weight, but it is located towards the top of the object. The weight and volume of the two objects is otherwise identical. The two objects are mostly hollow and can float in water. As the water level rises, at some point these objects begin to lift off the ground. Will one lift off the ground before the other, or will they both lift off the ground at the same time?

Thanks for any replies.

Text:   I have read that creativity is the ability to perceive something in a novel manner and thus create something new out of it while intelligence is the ability to acquire knowledge and utilise it accordingly. This means you can be intelligent without being creative but how can this be since high fluid intelligence is related to solving novel problems independent of previously acquired knowledge isn't this just creativity?
