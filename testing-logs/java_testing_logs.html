However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well

Text: I assume that the average temperature of Earth changes based on multiple variables: Distance from the sea/ocean, altitude, hours of daylight, time of day etc. What are the criteria for measuring the average temperature of Earth?

I also assume that each nation gives their own averages, but how do we determine the weights for each country? For example Russia is a lot bigger than Luxembourg, so Russia should have more variation in temperatures and their landmass should represent a larger proportion of the average temperatures.

Text: [Here](https://youtu.be/708q7LjMGso?t=154) is the interview.

He says 

&gt;There’s a great seam, a famous seam-a world famous one-- which I believe is called the Great Atlantic Fault. And it starts in northern Spain in the Basque Country, and it goes under the Bay of Biscay and comes up in south Wales. Then it goes under the Atlantic and comes up in Pennsylvania. So that if you took a Basque miner, or a Welsh miner or Pennsylvanian miner, and you could blindfold them and transport them, and they will recognise the coalface the moment they see it.  I believe it's four feet, six inches.

It's a beautiful interview and it seems believable enough.  But I can't find any references to the &quot;Great Atlantic Fault,&quot; outside of quotes of the interview or from the 2014 movie &quot;Pride&quot; where Bill Nighy's character closely paraphrase's Burton's speech.  Granted Burton says, &quot;I believe it's called the Great Atlantic Fault&quot; so maybe he just got the name wrong.  But is this a real geological feature?

Text: Beekeepers remove the honey from hives and bees must keep working and keep on pollinating flowers.

But I've read in another thread that wild bee hives don't slack, and once the hive is full of honey, they swarm and start a new hive with a new queen somewhere else.

Which of the two methods is better for the ecosystem? I would dare to guess that beekeept hives are better for orchards and fruit trees, as they keep a hive always nearby at full work, while wild hives are better for the wilderness as the colonies are more spread and and reach a larger area?

Also, aren't bees basically almost clones? Don't wild hives promote genetic diversity and are better posed for survival? (if not for a given hive, at least for a number of hives in the area)

I  haven't been able to get precise  answers on this one -- moving from sea  level to 10,000 ft for 3mos. of  work, I was advised to &quot;drink as much water as you possibly can&quot;, &quot;avoid  heavy drinking and caffeine&quot;, and to  &quot;eat at any time you're hungry at  all&quot; (for the whole time I'm at this  elevation).

What  is the exact  reason for this ? Does it have to do with less oxygen at  altitude ? What  makes the body fall to pieces if you don't practice  this constantly at high elevations ?

Text: We observe our world through the light visible to our eyes, however there are know organisms who see different wavelengths, bees for example can see ultraviolet light. Could there be planets where potential lifeforms might have to evolv to see x-rays or microwaves in order to observe their world?

If some planets received a different composition of light waves than ours I suspect it might be possible but I don't know if that is physically accurate. 

I know there are different types of stars and I know that the consensus is that a planet needs to be in the 'goldilocks zone' of a star to support life.

Thought I might ask here and hope it's not a completely stupid question haha thanks.

Text: A friend and I were arguing about the color of a car. I said it was pink. He said it was purple. I'm not a native speaker of English, so I wondered if that had perhaps something to do with it - perhaps my mother tongue delimited pink and purple differently than English. But asking some Americans, I found out that actually the jury was split. This got me thinking...  


\- Are some color boundaries fuzzier / more ambiguous than others? For instance, yellow might not be as contentious a color as others, but that is just my impression. 

  
\- If some color boundaries are fuzzier than others, is that consistent across languages? For instance, is the boundary between green and blue always fuzzy?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Are there any biological bases for color definitions, anchored perhaps in color perception and processing?  


I realize that this question straddles many disciplines, so I flaired it with Psychology but it could as well have been linguistic, anthropological etc.

Original Antigenic sin is a concern for me.

Text: Lemons (which I buy from the market) have a high degree of axial symmetry.  Rotate them around their major axis, and they're usually pretty similar from all angles.  Cut one in half along the minor axis, and the segments are each about the same angular size.  The albedo is pretty circular and uniform, too.   


And then, the seeds.   There are usually fewer than one per segment.   And when that's the case, you just have 1 in one segment, another in another, and they jut off in seemingly random angles.   


Why the absence of azimuthal symmetry for seeds?

Text: I was recently thinking about multi grade motor oil and had a hard time understanding viscosity as a function of temperature.  So far as I understand, the idea is that the oil is less viscous when cold so it’ll run through a cold engine faster, ergo 10w30 would be a viscosity of 10 when cold and then 30 when warm.  But logically that makes zero sense to me; wouldn’t hot oil be less viscous?  One example a website gave was a marble being dropped into honey at two different temperatures and as expected the marble through warm honey traveled faster than the marble in cold honey.  So what am I missing here?

While when i am studying mineralogy and crystallography i see that many mineral's higher temperature polymorphs are more ordered than the low temperature. For example Akali feldspars high temperature polymorphs (Sanidine and Orthoclase) are Monoclinic in symmetry and the lower temperature polymorph (microcline) is in Triclinic symmetry.

As far as i understand monoclinic is supposed to be more ordered than triclinic. So what am i misunderstanding here? Why are these two things counter intuitive?

Beyond the characteristic erythema migrans (&quot;bullseye&quot;) rash, symptoms range from arthritis to damaging nervous and cardiac systems. With so many cases every year, it is imperative that everyone learn what steps can be taken to minimize and prevent Lyme disease infections while also getting up to date on the current scientific and medical interventions being used to treat and cure Lyme disease in infected individuals.

Join us today at 2 PM ET (18 UT) for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology, about all aspects of Lyme disease (and other tickborne diseases). We'll take your questions and discuss what people can do to prevent Lyme disease, how Lyme disease is best diagnosed and treated, and what to do if you suspect that you have Lyme disease. Ask us anything!

Is the fundamental limit to how fast a temperature can change based of a plank length, or something else? I suppose it must be linked to fundamental forces and atomic motion, but I can’t really get an intuitive sense of what might limit the speed of temperature change.

Text: I am a medical student and I am currently going through pulmonary physiology. I understand the concepts of diffusion and perfusion-limited gases, but there is one point in my physiology textbook which I cannot seem to understand.

When discussing DLCO, the textbook states that CO is a diffusion-limited gas. It then goes on to discuss the effects of changes in flow (Q) on DLCO and how doubling or halving flow does not impact DLCO, supporting that it is a diffusion not perfusion-limited gas. But I do not get why changing Q would not affect DLCO. Here is my take on it: Arterial CO pressure does not equilibrate with alveolar CO pressure by the end of the pulmonary capillary (i.e., diffusion-limited), but it still does rise slightly to some value lower than that of the alveoli. So wouldn’t increasing flow decrease contact time and thus cause an even lower arterial CO pressure throughout the pulmonary capillary and thus the gradient for CO diffusion would be greater than at lower flow rates? And therefore, a higher DLCO?

In support of my understanding, increased DLCO can be observed in obesity and is attributed to increased pulmonary blood flow in these patients.

Noteworthy to mention, the textbook does assume that pulmonary capillary dimensions are constant with changing flow. But still, I do not believe this would make the above reasoning false.

Thank you in advance!

I know tungsten has the highest known melting point of any *pure* element at 3695 K, but I read somewhere that there are also other alloys that can take hotter temperature. I know carbon sublimes at around 4098 K so i'm wondering if there is anything that can go beyond those temperatures without a phase transition. Compounds are allowed too.

Text: This is probably a silly question, but... seeing photos of the spectacular ice cliffs (in sea ice or where where glaciers end, for example) always makes me wonder how much more impressive they were in the last glacial maximum. Would or could they have been much taller than they are now?

As near as I can figure out with back-of-the-napkin math, the tallest column of ice that could support its own weight would be something like 5-5.5km tall, and my understanding is that the ice sheets have been up to 4km thick. I'm sure it wasn't just a flat 4km sheet that ended in a vertical cliff in like Montana or something, though. Would it have looked a lot like the edges of the ice sheets today, or could there have been even bigger cliffs?

Vh chain - 65 variable * 27 diversity * 6 joining

Vl(kappa) chain - 40 variable * 5 joining

Multiplying these numbers gives me just over 2 million unique sequences but I expected it to be far greater than that.

I’m using Immunology: The immune system in health and disease for the numbers of gene segments.

So if you were to explain to the aliens with no concept of left and right, you could tell them to set up an experiment where they connect a battery to a wire with the negative pole in a specified direction and the positive pole in the other. 

Then all you need to do is state that when viewing the wire from a perspective relative to the flow of the electrons, you observe the direction of rotation of the magnetic field, and at the &quot;up&quot; position (opposite the direction of gravity) is either right or left depending on the perspective relative to electron flow?

Text: My brother is training to be a fighter pilot and his training requires him to go through simulations that expose him to upwards of +7.5 Gs. My questions regards the risk of RV/LV hypertrophy due to the alterations in cardiac preload and afterlife from being under these Gs. 

I currently work as a scribe in pediatric cardiomyopathy and see a lot of HCM, and knowing the pathology of ventricular hypertrophy got me wondering if there was a risk on RV or LV hypertrophy in fighter pilots due to chronic exposure due intense +Gs

I read one study from Israeli fighter pilots that found no difference in cardiac dimensions by echocardiography when comparing pilots exposed to +Gs vs. -Gs (compared over a 5 year period). However are there studies that compare cardiac dimensions and functions of pilots to the baseline population not exposed to these type of G forces?

Text: Two reasons actually, first, how do we know they are still entangled from just one end? And does the knowing disrupt the entanglement?

So if we have two entangled particles and we send one out to orbit Jupiter (or anywhere far away) on a spaceship, can the people on the ship know if the particle is still entangled without disrupting the entanglement and without communicating at all with the people holding the other particle on Earth?

What if we had the tech to send sets of 26 entangles particle pairs on the ship, for simple example we send 3 sets of 26 entangled particles, and designate each pair in each 26 set a letter of the alphabet, then the people on earth interrupted the pair, in the first set of 26, with the designation of the letter Y causing it to disentangle so the people on the ship would know that we disentangled the letter Y pair. Then the second set the people on Earth caused the pair designated letter E to disentangle, and then the third set they disentangle the pair designated letter S, have we not just communicated FTL?

I'm a stupid monkey so just tell me why.

How does the lack of development of a heart, hinder the development of the upper body? Why isn't the lower body (as) affected? (generally the legs do grow, just not properly)

Does it have something to do with the lack of proper oxygenated blood?

Text: I have a scientific background mainly in math and computer science and some parts of evolution make sense to me like birds evolving better suited beaks or viruses evolving to spread faster. These things evolve in small changes each of which has a benefit.

But a circulation system needs a number of different parts to work, you need a heart at least 1 lung, blood vessels and blood to carry the oxygen around. Each of these very complex and has multicellular structure (except blood).

I see how having a circulation system gives an organism an advantage but not how we got here.

The only explanation I have found on the Internet is that we can see genetic similarities between us and organisms without a circulation system but that feels very weak evidence.

To my computer science brain evolution feels like making a series of small tweaks to a computer program, changing a variable or adding a line of code. Adding a circulation system feels a lot more than a tweak and would be the equivalent of adding a new features that required multiple changes across many files and probably the introduction whole new components and those changes need to be done to work together to achieve the overall goal.

Many thx

EDIT Thanks for all the responses so far, I have only had time to skim through them so far. In particular thanks to those that have given possible evolutionary paths to evolve form a simple organism to a human with a complex circulation system.

Text: I had heard that lemon juice makes your body alkaline, which made no sense to me, so I did some googling. I found that it was not true, as I anticipated (since your body regulates your blood's pH level), but what I couldn't find a solid conclusion for in either direction was whether or not lemon juice creates alkaline byproducts in digestion. 

I found many semi-reputable sources (https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/lemon-juice-acidic-or-alkaline for example) that seemed to agree with that, and say that while it doesn't affect your body or blood's pH level, it can make your urine more alkaline. Most of the people I'd seen refuting it where simply saying that lemon juice can't turn your body alkaline and that it's pseudoscience hogwash, rather than specifically talking to the point that it does or doesn't make alkaline byproducts during digestion.

So my question is: Does lemon juice produce alkaline byproducts during digestion and make your urine more alkaline, and if it does, what's the process that occurs to make this happen and what is happening to all the acid? Where are the extra Hydrogen ions going?

EDIT: Thanks for all the replies! Got some really good ones that answered my question with academic sources! Just wanted to note that as I mentioned, I know that your body regulates pH and that trying to turn your body or urine &quot;more alkaline&quot; doesn't have any health benefits, was just curious on this specific point of urine/alkaline byproducts because I couldn't find an explanation but saw relatively reputable sources suggest it's true.

Still, always good to include that as part of the explanation for others who may not know that it gives no health benefits.

Text: I thought that was exclusive to mammals and maybe birds, that the [Ancient Reptilian Brains](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Triune_brain) literally had not developed the “layers” responsible for what we'd call “emotions” (allegedly, the [Limbic System](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/lymbic%20system)?). Yet, I'm finding out many anecdotal examples of reptiles being loyal or physically affectionate. I'm very confused by this.

EDIT: a poster has brought up that we may be confusing “affection,” which only mammals can do, with “imprinting,” which “simpler” brains can manage. What are the differences between the two, in practice? Can one design tests to distinguish one process from the other, on a behavioral, empirical, tangible, objective level?

Text: I’ve been reading Lewis-Williams’ works on entropic phenomena and altered states of consciousness that are achieved in shamanism, and while he does a good job of showing their universality and their effects on human perception of reality, he doesn’t give a detail record of how exactly the specific sensations frequently associated with these states come about. 

Some of the common sensations he mentions are floating, weightlessness, suffocation, and a range of hallucinations. 

My question is, what exactly is happening to the brain that is causing this sensations — not how they are interpreted by the subject, but what is objectively happening that the subject interprets

Text: Looking at [the Wikipedia page for absorption bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_band), it seems to me that there's a sizable window - i.e. a [local minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima) \- in the graph for [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation) absorption, as per [this image](https://i.stack.imgur.com/jOhUm.png).

[Water vapor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor), [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen), [ozone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone), and [methane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane) appear to be entirely transparent to radiation of 4 μm wavelength, [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) only appears to start absorbing it *after* that point, and even [nitrous oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide) has a window there. Moreover, [Rayleigh scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering) is also minimal there.

On top of *that*, [this Earth Science Stack Exchange answer](https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/13620/does-anyone-have-absorption-coefficients-at-different-wavelengths-for-sulfur-dio/13621#13621) and [its source](https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/13620/does-anyone-have-absorption-coefficients-at-different-wavelengths-for-sulfur-dio/13621#13621) show minimal (sub-0.5%) absorbance of [sulfur dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide) at that wavelength. Why is this? It seems like a rather odd coincidence for so many things to be transparent to 4 μm (a specific wavelength of mid-wavelength infrared) EM radiation.

As a coincidence, this is one of many parts why global warming is a thing, IIRC: mid-range infrared comes in through the 4 μm gap, gets soaked up by the Earth, and later gets re-radiated at different wavelengths that *do* get soaked up by the atmosphere.

I just don't know *why* there's a 4 μm gap there.

Text: As a Yemeni-American, I've noticed trends in how other first-gens from (loosely) similar regions and genetic backgrounds show greater susceptibility to certain diseases. 

I understand that we know, for example, that certain populations don't react well to alcohol on a genetic level, and have a greater propensity for addiction. Then, after enough generations of that, that population's gene pool has a greater physical tolerance or resistance to some of the negative effects of alcoholism. Yemen is an interesting case because many parts of it are inhabited by people who've resided there for such a long time and with so little mixing, relative to many other places.

Then of course there are the stark differences in lifestyles, and certain morphological or physiological advantages or disadvantages can become the opposite.

Do we understand more than this? I've read that genetics will require a quantum leap before we can more accurately analyze and predict disease susceptibility based on genetic markers, so I guess I'm just trying to get a read on how well we *actually* understand these topics, or even how we come to the conclusions we *can* draw.

A cable between the alternator and battery is cut : the battery does not charge. What happens to this generated energy? It can't be noise/heat/light. 

Energy can't be created or destroyed so where does this kinetic energy go?

Radio towers only have a certain distance on Earth they can broadcast, and if the space shuttle is currently in orbit on the exact opposite side of the Earth as the antenna, the communications would have cut out. So back when the space program was just starting, what was the technology they used to talk to people in space. Was it a series of broadcasting antennas around the globe? Something that has a strong enough broadcast range to pass through planetary bodies? Some kind of aimed technology like a satellite dish that could track the ship in orbit? What was the communication infrastructure they had to build and how has it changed to today?

Text: In early May, reports began circulating about confirmed cases of monkeypox, an orthopoxvirus similar to smallpox. As of mid-June, there were over 2100 reported cases of monkeypox in dozens of countries. While a great deal is already known about the science of the monkeypox virus, this outbreak has raised several new questions about its transmissibility and impact on human health in both the short and long terms. With the world's attention heightened to such disease outbreaks due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this seems like a good opportunity to provide answers and help alleviate concerns.

We are experts in infectious diseases who are here to provide the facts about monkeypox and counter the mis-information that has been spreading about this disease. Join us today at 2 PM ET (18 UT) for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology, about the monkeypox outbreak. We'll answer your questions about the symptoms of monkeypox and how it spreads, current strategies for treatment and prevention, and what can be done to contain this (and future) outbreaks. Ask us anything!

Text: I’ll preface this with saying not antiperspirant, deodorant. Antiperspirant contains aluminum to stop sweat, I’m specifically asking about the antibacterial ingredient in deodorant which prevents bacteria from making odor as a by-product. Everywhere online says triclosan, but I haven’t seen that in deodorant for years now, as well as many cosmetic products. I know deodorants contain perfumes that add scent, but that’s not what I’m asking either. What’s actually preventing the skunky BO smell that results from bacteria eating the contents of your eccrine sweat gland sweat?

Text: I've read from several different sources that when a fresh injection of basaltic magma intrudes into a more silica-rich magma chamber under a volcano, some sort of reaction happens that ultimately leads to a large explosive eruption. I've specifically heard this implicated for the 19th century Krakatoa eruption, where people point to volcanic rock of varying color bands indicating partially mixed magmas that cooled preserving the different rock types. 

However, these sources don't mention a mechanism for this. Is there some sort of chemical reaction between the different magmas? Is it a physical reaction relating to different temperature/density/viscosity/gas content/something else?

What leads two bodies of relatively stable magma to generate immense pressure and explode when mixed together?

Text: [The Highly Controversial Plan To Stop Climate Change](https://youtu.be/i4Hnv_ZJSQY)

I am not an environmental scientist, a climate scientist, nor a resource scientist, but I do have a fairly robust understanding of our current predicament in regards to climate change. The video I’ve linked presents Russ George, who claims that based upon his research, a planet wide bloom of phytoplankton could absorb a significant percentage of the world’s carbon. I have several questions about this.

Based on what I’ve seen, his message is backed by research. However, I’m unaware whether or not it is peer reviewed, or even seriously considered by others within his field. If it were to be true, then I would imagine climate scientists would be talking about this nonstop, but I’ve only just heard about it. I can’t tell, and any clarity on whether or not his work and claims are credible would be helpful.

If it is credible, then I have several further questions. What would be the ecological ramifications of having a phytoplankton bloom on a global scale? Beyond that, how much time would it buy humanity to switch over to carbon neutral methods of energy production?

Thank you in advance for any insight into this issue.

Text: So I use Indoxacarb fire ant bait on the colony and I see the workers carry the bait inside the mound.  Then on avg 3 days later the mound is dead.  The pesticide supposedly is fed to the queen and the colony dies.  But how?  Do they all just starve?  Or shutdown like the Borg? Or do they relocate and find a new queen?

Text: I guess firstly I wanna know a few logistical things:  

How do we discover what the new strand of the flu is?

How long does it take to develop a vaccine for it?

Why is this faster than other vaccines?

How do we verify that it works and is safe for patients in less than a year?

How effective is the vaccine, and if it's really effective, how is it made to be so effective year after year?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like there's a &quot;How to Make a Flu Shot This Year&quot; handbook out there.

Are there any other viruses out there that we update our vaccines for so regularly? Thanks in advance!

Text: Hello everyone hope you have a great day. So I just began studying the immune system and I have some questions. 
So if I understand it correctly so far, when pathogens enter the body they have to get recognized somehow, so the body can destroy them. So pathogens have these pamp (pathogen associated molecular patterns) that get recognized by the phagocytes with the help of &quot;toll like receptors&quot;. Also my textbook says something about opsonins, chemical compounds that &quot; mark&quot; the pathogens so phagocytes can recognize and destroy them. 

My questions are:
1) How did the cell evolve those toll receptors? Was it randomly but they stayed bc they are useful? Let's say you have a cell that no pathogen has ever interacted with it. So logically, the cell hasn't any receptor for it (or it has but it was a random generation-im not sure how it works). 
2) From my understanding, opsonins bind to the pathogen somehow and help the phagocyte recognize it. So opsonins have a lock-key relationship with phagocytes? It would make sense for the cell to recognize molecules that are part of the cell. But how do opsonins bind to the pathogens? My textbook isn't going on detail. 

Thank you for reading so far and sorry if my questions are stupid. Also sorry for any grammar or spelling mistakes, English isn't my first language.

Text: Genetic modification in the 20th century was a bit of a crapshoot -- literally. You'd put a bunch of DNA on some pellets and shoot them into a plant with an air gun, it's honestly so hilariously basic, it's surprising that it works. That, and Sanford is just a crazy person now. But that's another story.

But the genes get inserted pretty randomly, which is weird to me. Do we just practically test the organisms afterwards to see which ones got the insertion right?

Or can we predict when or how often a gene will be expressed from its contents and location in the genome?

Or do we not know this yet?

In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for 'X' were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;.

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

Text: In a James Webb photo thread, someone posted that the Carina Nebula has a density of a few atoms per cubic meter. This seems off to me, as this is close to the average density of the intergalactic medium of one atom per cubic meter, which is much less than the interstellar medium average density of one atom per cubic centimeter, which is much less than the average density of a planetary nebular (100-10,000 atoms per cubic centimeter). But I can't find any information on the web to help me understand this better.

Text: This question is specifically aimed at showing how asking high quantities of a population to take the vaccine stops the spread at a population level.

I would assume the following things to be relevant

1. chance of people who get infected that are vaccinated
2. chance of then infecting others, modulated by length of illness, viral load and symptoms (coughing)
3. how good the immunity is from infection + vaccine, i.e. how often vaccinated people get reinfected vs unvaccinated

Im asking this because its pretty frustrating that people always pull a specific country with high vaccination rates and high cases and then say young people getting the vaccine doesnt help others at all. I have the suspicion that their view is limited, but I would like to see evidence or more professional perspectives on the matter :)

Text: In this case, I am concerned only about charge rate, not data transfer rates; but I understand just enough to grasp that this also depends on USB standard level.

[ELI70:] So, consider the case where there are -four- pieces in the chain: Host, &quot;adapter&quot;, cable, device.  Example: in my (old) car, I have a little adapter that plugs into the cig lighter socket; the cable plugs into that; and my phone then charges.  (Until recently, I naïvely thought it was nothing more than a voltage converter.)

* Does EVERY piece need to be at the same level of USB standard in order to get the higher charge rate?  IOW, if the little 12V adapter is 10+ years old, it's probably USB 1.0 and can't possibly deliver 100W even if the cable and device would like it, right?
 * (If that's the case, how does one address this issue?)
* What about these household [combination wall outlets](https://www.acehardware.com/departments/lighting-and-electrical/switches-outlets-and-plugs/outlets/3496551) : What USB version / charge rate will I likely get -- even WITH a USB-C cable?

Many thanks.  Apologies if this has been asked before; I -did- search but didn't recognise anything I could understand 😉 .

It got me wondering about bio-signatures in alien atmospheres. I was thinking oxygen might be a good candidate. Then I thought about the Fermi paradox and the great filter. What if life evolved intelligence and blew itself back to the stone age? What would that look like in the data? I'm guessing we would see a normalized distribution of planet types, masses, and sizes. A certain subset of these (Earth like in the Goldilocks zone) would have a small number of outliers. Planets with oxygen atmospheres or potentially radioactive atmospheres. How would that story evolve? Do you think people would even care if they found out that some planet orbiting a star in their night sky was the galaxies largest graveyard?

But what if say, you know beforehand, the elements of a sequence are between 1 - 6 like in a dice. You’re trying to figure out if a certain sampling method is random. Say you get 3 2 1 2 2 1 3 1 2 2 1 3 2 1 1 2 3 1. The sequence itself doesn’t seem to exhibit a pattern yet they all share the same property of being within the set {1,2,3} and excluding the set {4,5,6}

Randomness is often defined as the lack of a pattern. This sequence by the face of it doesn’t seem to have a pattern yet we know it’s not coming from a uniform random distribution from 1-6 given 4 5 and 6 aren’t selected. How do you explain this?

Text: And does being immunocompromised make a difference?

**ETA:** I’m not immunocompromised, sorry, didn’t realise people would draw that conclusion. I was just curious about what would happen if an immunocompromised person *did* lick a cut. Clearly, it’s nothing good.

The reddit app isn’t letting me reply to posts, but thanks to all who’ve answered so far!

Text: Question on bond length, strength, atomic radii, and orbital overlap

We’re told the following in undergrad:

Poor orbital overlap (say, in H2S with a small hydrogen and large sulfur) means a weak bond 

Greater bond length means less bond strength (weaker bond) 

Yet larger atomic radii means greater bond length (for instance, the bond between S and Cl is longer than S and H, but yet S and Cl have better orbital overlap, meaning their bond is stronger despite being longer).

So does this mean that “greater bond length = weaker bond” is not always true? I’m studying for the MCAT and am trying to reconcile this. Thanks.

Text: Last ice age in Norhern Europe ended some ~10 000 years ago. Agriculture was developed around the same time, and the area of Fertice Crescent in Middle East is often pointed out here. In present day this area is rather dry, except the areas in Turkey and the river banks in Iran, Iraq and Egypt.

What are the estimates what kind of climate there was in those areas 10 000 years ago? They were probably much more fertile due to lower temperature. I would also guess that a large ice cap in Norhern Europe would have lowered the temperature even more, and also affected on the precipitation in the area.

Text: I am currently reading [The Selfish Gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene), and during one chapter he lightly touched on crossover during meiosis. I started thinking about crossover and I have a lot of questions that I can't really find the answer to. It seems like most places just touch on crossover as a step during meiosis, but don't really elaborate much. Anyway, here are my questions I hope someone can help me wrap my head around this:

* First of all: does crossover only happen (at most) once per chromosome? All diagrams look somewhat like [this](https://ib.bioninja.com.au/_Media/crossing-over_med.jpeg), which indicate that they swap only the ends. Is that the case, or are those diagrams an oversimplification and more than one &quot;pieces&quot; that are crossed over?

* If the answer to the above is yes, then I want to move onto this [meiosis diagram](https://cdn.lecturio.com/assets/Overview-of-meiosis-I-and-II-1200x1034.png). Is it true to assume then that we all likely possess entire chromosomes that came directly from our grandparents? In the diagram, each of the 4 cells has 2 chromosomes, one that's intact, and one that's crossed over. So for example, if my dad passed an &quot;intact&quot; chromosome 1 to me, there's a 1/4 chance that I'll pass that intact chromosome 1 to my son. Is that correct?

* How does crossing over work with the sex chromosomes? In the case of eggs, there's always two Xs, do those crossover? In the case of sperm, there's one X and one Y, do those crossover in anyway, or are they left alone?

* If the answer to question 1 is yes, then is there a pre-determined (approximate or accurate) length that's exchanged? If so, how is it determined? If it's random, what determines it? 

* Is the number of base pairs in an exchange the same on each side? Also, this question and the above assume it's done by number of base pairs. Is it &quot;calculated&quot; differently perhaps? Number of genes? Something else?

* Now, the question in the title: how does the process ensure that no really bad errors are introduced? If I understand correctly, it's not necessary that the two homologous chromosomes are the same length. One may have mutations the other doesn't, and vice versa. It's also likely those mutations are fine independently. But when mixed together, they could break things... so why doesn't it?

* And lastly: if question 1 is yes, has the existence of the crossover process lead to &quot;less important&quot; (or &quot;more ok to mutate) genes to be at the tips, and &quot;more important&quot; genes to be towards the middle? For example, per the question above, I imagine that eye color genes or genes that contribute to my face shape or skin color or traits like that are more &quot;ok&quot; to be mutated, where as for example, the gene for hemoglobin... you don't want to mess with that one.


Thanks for looking at my wall of text. I'm happy to restate questions if they don't make sense. Hope someone or many of you can help me with this.

Thanks again!

Text: Is there some kind of concept of evolutionary permanence that I can read about?

Like, of course there's DNA: no creature will ever evolve on Earth that is not based in DNA. Right? And probably something similar, if weaker, applies to all the various crazy proteins and other stuff that makes a cell work. Like, look at how conserved photopigments are across the animal kingdom (even beyond, you can find photopigments in non-animals that might be evolutionarily related to the opsins in human and fly retinas, etc etc).

Then you can get up to bigger scales, to things like cell types. Like, will there ever be a descendant of animals that has no neurons? It seems like, since neurons first evolved, they are *stuck*. I read a paper a while back on similarities between invertebrate and vertebrate neurons, and was amazed. They even use more-or-less the same neurotransmitters (if in different roles).

Then bigger: since insects invented wings, virtually none of them have lost them (ants, sort of - and a few other very weird examples). And insects always have that exoskeleton and always will - no insect will ever evolve with an endoskeleton, right?

And how tetrapods all have this 1-arm-bone then 2-arm-bone then lots-of-bones plan for their arms and legs (since they all started as fins-on-pegs). It seems like that just will never go away (though you might lose your arms and legs, like a snake, if you have them they always follow that plan).

What do we call this phenomenon?

Text: Urine drug tests that rely on dipsticks seem really counterintuitive. There, the presence of two bands (test + control), no matter how faint, means that the sample is **negative** for the drug tested. On the other hand, the absence of a band in the test area means the sample is **positive**. 

This is of course the 'opposite' of how COVID-antigen tests work. Moreover, if the test is detecting the drug (or a secondary metabolite) through immunocolorimetry, the way these tests work make little sense.

Could anybody explain? It'd be greatly appreciated.

If she needs a blood transfusion and we then did a 23 and me type test but with blood (not the saliva test).  What results are we going to get back?  The donors heritage or hers?  Or a bit of both.  

Whose dna is in that blood?  If she drops some blood at a crime scene and the police swab it for evidence.  Will it match to her dna, will it have both sets of dna?  If it shows as the donors dna in the blood, does it change back to her blood over time?  What about organ donation?  That organ will always have the dna of the donor yes?

Text: Something I've been thinking about. Generally, if we picture extreme heat wiping out life - we imagine the heat causing evaporation and creating a dry, lifeless desert. 

But hypothetically, if a climate was hot enough - but was still wet/humid/receiving large quantities of rainfall, could you get a &quot;desert&quot; (as in, dead/lifeless) that is still quite wet - but can't support life because of the extreme heat?

In other words, **how hot does it have to get** before plant/animal life can no longer survive **even** in the presence of large quantities of water?

Text: When we see a distant star or galaxy, we are seeing light that is coming toward us from a luminous source.

When we see a planet, we are seeing light reflected back at us after scattering on the planet's surface.

But I've never understood how we 'see' the CMB. If it represents the early universe before any luminous structures existed (i.e. &quot;background&quot;), and that early universe is expanding away from us, what surface sent those photons toward us? Are they just flying in every random direction? 

I suspect I am just thinking about universal expansion incorrectly, but would love some clarification. Thanks!

Today, June 30, is International Asteroid Day-but at NASA, every day is asteroid day!

Asteroids are rocky, airless remnants left over from the early formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago and NASA and our partners are always looking to the skies to study these ancient time capsules. From our missions [to explore the Trojan asteroids in Jupiter's orbit](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/lucy/in-depth/) and [bring a piece of an asteroid back to Earth](https://www.nasa.gov/osiris-rex), to our [efforts to find, track and monitor asteroids](https://www.nasa.gov/specials/pdco/index.html) and other near-Earth objects to protect our planet from potential impact hazards, we're uncovering the history of our solar system while working to keep our future safe.

Ask our experts anything about what we're learning from asteroids, how we're protecting the Earth, and much more!

Hoy, 30 de junio, es el Día internacional del asteroide, pero en la NASA, ¡todos los días son días de asteroides!

Los asteroides son restos rocosos sin atmósfera que quedaron de la formación temprana de nuestro sistema solar hace unos 4.600 millones de años. La NASA y sus socios miran constantemente al cielo para estudiar estas antiguas cápsulas del tiempo. Desde nuestras misiones para explorar los asteroides troyanos en la órbita de Júpiter y traer un trozo de asteroide de vuelta a la Tierra, hasta nuestros esfuerzos para encontrar, rastrear y monitorear asteroides y otros objetos cercanos a la Tierra para proteger nuestro planeta de posibles peligros de impacto, estamos descubriendo la historia de nuestro sistema solar mientras trabajamos para mantener nuestro futuro seguro.

Sorry if that doesn't make sense. Basically, from everything I've seen, cross-section (likelihood) is higher with thermal neutrons than fast neutrons. However, the US NCR says that &quot;a fissionable nuclide requires fast neutrons to induce fission.&quot; So I was wondering, is this a mistake? Does it only matter when in the process of inducing fission or is it something else? I'm assumingg I've made a mistake but I'm not sure where

Cheers.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been learning about Piaget recently through the Introduction to Psychology Yale course ([https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6A08EB4EEFF3E91F](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6A08EB4EEFF3E91F)) and I was wondering if it would be possible, maybe through a set of tailored puzzles, to accelerate a child's advancement through Piaget's developmental stages.

 

\- Is there a physical limit for this (possibly that children gain these abilities not only through assimilation with their environment but also the physical growth of brain, therefore such puzzles/toys would not be effective as the child does not have the physical brain capacity to advance in their developmental stage yet?)

&amp;#x200B;

Any studies/videos regarding this topic would be greatly appreciated, let me know what you all think.

Is it somehow possible to delay or prevent radioactive materials from falling apart?

If not, why is that so?

Text: I understand how the redox reaction works, but I can’t understand why electrons seemingly spontaneously decide to move across the wire to the cathode from the anode.

In the example of zinc and copper in an aqueous solution, it’s obvious why copper oxidizes zinc: they’re in physical contact. However in a galvanic cell they are separated by considerable distance. 

How is it that the cathode just *knows* the anode is there and current starts flowing when there’s no direct interaction between the oxidant and reductant?

One such organism is a worm that would bore holes into the wood of the hull and cause the ship's structural integrity to weaken.

Since humans have transitioned to using metal and fiberglass to construct ships and boats, have these worms declined in population? Or would these same worms also act as parasites to other marine organisms?

If what we’re doing is looking into the early universe, and the universe has been expanding since the Big Bang, then aren’t we just seeing those first galaxies as they were closer together than they would be today? 

And if what we’re seeing is the very beginning of the universe then wouldn’t pointing the telescope anywhere else for a long enough time reveal a similar picture? In fact, wouldn’t we technically be seeing even the same early galaxies no matter where you point it at?

Text: *Observations:

Every time I trim my body hair, it grows back.

Now there can be two possible explanations for this:

*Explanation 1:

Body hair growth is continuous and hair grows indefinitely long if left ungroomed.

But I know this is not true, because for the first 18 years of my ife I never trimmed any hair, but they still didn't grow further after reaching a certain size.

*Explation 2:

There is some sort of feedback mechanism that let's the hair root cells know that the hair has been trimmed and they grow enough to compensate for the exact length that has been lost.

*Question:

But if hair is made of dead cells, how exactly can the body tell if that particular strand of hair has been cut

(I tried cutting out a patch of hair for this purpose and it grew to the same length as well after a few weeks)

And the exact length to which it has been cut?

....

I specifically put body hair in my question because I've never tested our the full limit of head hair, so I assumed it grows indefinitely.

Text: I just watched the new Jurassic World movie and while I understand it wasn't scientifically accurate, it made me wonder if dinosaurs actually lived in current times and reproduced, how fast would it take them?

Generally, most things on Earth have lifespans seemingly corresponding to their size.  Some flies live for days while larger animals live for years.  Of course there are exceptions, but its kind of a general rule.  Do scientists know, or can estimate, how long would, for example, a T-Rex take from egg to hatching, and from hatchling to natural end of life?  Are we talking a few decades, a hundred years, more than a hundred?  Something like the Brachiosaurus must take many decades to reach full maturity right?  If someone told me it took them 200 years to grow to that size I would not question it.

1. Does temperature measure translational, rotational, and vibrational motion?

2. If temperature measures average kinetic energy, couldn’t it just be expressed in terms of joules?

3. Is there a strict linear relationship between energy input and change in temperature? If not, why?

4. Does particle mass affect specific heat? If not why do particles have different specific heats?

5. What is the relationship between specific heat and specific entropy? Why do they have the same units?

6. If joules and kelvin both measure energy, then is entropy dimensionless?

Does that means Schrodinger's Thief isn't really in all 5 houses at once, right? Is the cat just a thought experiment to show absurd consequences of Copenhagen? 

Is observing/applying energy the same problem with a hypothetical graviton? Like if we abstract out a graviton, we can't measure it without adding to energy to it, which adds to the mass, which adds to the gravity, etc etc etc?

Text: My very basic understanding is that electric eels stack their electricytes in series similar to many many tiny batteries together to generate hundreds of volts. But wouldn't the electric current just flow within their eletricity generating organ from one direction to the other? How does it circuit with the outside environment? What structure is insulating the anode from the cathode?

For the purpose of this question, if a person who is getting a bone marrow transplant for a non-cancer related issue (such as aplastic anemia), could this transmit leukemia from the donor to the recipient?

I mean fish have their sim bladder. But what do whales do ? do they &quot;just swim down&quot;? What happens when the air in their lungs get compressed and the average density increases ? How do they stay buoyant at different depths ? 

And what do the sperm whales do when they sleep in this strange buoyant way ? how do they stay buoyant while sleeping ?

Or do they just &quot;overpower&quot; the density change with muscle power ?   


This might be a bit of a convoluted question but maybe someone has some expertise in the area. Thanks :)

what does it mean to be of constant intensity? I know that intensity is power/area. so as the power goes up, the area goes up as well. but what does this mean in real life example?

what does it mean to have changing light intensity? i understand it would probably mean higher power over smaller area. but what does this mean in real life example?

Or does it perhaps get absorbed directly through the skin?

Text: I was taught that when the solar system was forming, the sun pulled in the planets that were heavier, so rocky planets are closest to the sun. Thats why lighter planets (gas giants) are further away. 

But what about the ice planets? are they lighter than the gas giants? were they once in a gaseous state? 

whats the deal with Pluto in all this?

Why don't vaccines just put the spike protein into the lipid nanoparticles instead? Wouldn't that trigger the same immune response? Why go to the extra trouble to get our own cells to synthesize the protein?

Edit:  Thanks guys, my questions are fairly answered and given me more food for thought and direction to focus study.  My general takeaway from the thread is that these videos are close enough to &quot;reality&quot; to be presented to a student as such, with some small disclaimers that do not necessarily detract from the animations' accuracy.

Text: I’ve read lots of references to the Laurentide ice sheet being a mile thick layer of ice covering Canada and part of the US but I’m struggling to visualize what this would look like. 

Did it eventually slope down to ground/sea level at its edges? Or could you walk on dry ground next to it with open air on one side and a mile high wall of ice on the other? 

What happened when it encountered mountains? Did the ice move like glaciers or did the sheet just add and lose ice at the edges? 

How did weather work over the ice sheet if for thousands of miles in any direction, the “ground” was a over 5,000 feet higher than the rest of the continent and surrounding oceans? Did clouds run into it and get stuck? Did they exist over it?

Text: So I know there's not much to go on, and that is partly my fault for not thinking about this sub in advance, but I have a question about the corneal stroma.

Today, I was at school and the teacher showed us a cornea through the microscope. It didn't say what stain it was and the teacher didn't know, but it was not HE and I'm fairly certain it was not orcein stain or silver impregnation, but I might be wrong on the latter as it was a darker stain.

The main point I want to arrive at is that the stroma,
which in HE looks fairly homogenous in color, was very
clearly divided into 3 fairly equal layers, with the middle
one lighter, as if no pigment got attached to it, and the
outer ones darker, with one of them darker than the
other (I wanna say the darker one was the one near the
corneal endothelium).

Now, I initially thought this has to be because of some biochemical component that binds the stain, which for some reason wasn't in the middle of the stroma, but I made a quick google search and see that the stroma has fibers going into different directions. Could this be the answer to why there were 3 layers? Is there another answer?

Ps: I will try to ask the teacher for it again, next time, and if I get it I'll take a photo. I didn't because I thought of this sub on my way home. Either way, any ideas?

Text: The technology/strategy behind mRNA vaccines is truly remarkable, but many explanations I've read seem to skip over a crucial logical step that is the basis of my question.

Once the mRNA enters a cell and the cell begins producing the protein that the mRNA encodes for, what are the processes between this stage and the stage of the immune system interacting with it? The state of affairs at this stage is a foreign protein inside the cell and it needs to end up in the &quot;hands off the immune system&quot;. If the protein in question is say the so-called &quot;spike protein&quot; of COVID-19, how does it get outside of the cell or to the surface of the cell? 

Cells are complicated^citation ^needed and usually have many interconnected parts like proteins helping other proteins get where they need to go or to fold in a particular way. Does the inherent shape/structure of the spike protein in this case make it thermodynamically favorable to embed itself in the cell's membrane and express itself outward? Proteins don't generally just leak out of cells so my current best guess is that it's presented by the cell in some way. Assuming this is the case, does that immune system now recognize that cell as foreign and destroy it (and thus 'read' the spike protein)?

Thanks for anyone's time.

Text: According to an air pressure calculator I found on Google, the air at 2 km above MSL would be about 0.8 atm and at 2.5 km above MSL it would be about 0.75 atm.

As per my understanding, getting 20-25% less oxygen per breath would mean that a high-altitude athlete's body would have more RBCs, bigger lungs, and a bigger heart, and that should give a noticeable advantage to the high altitude athlete.

But from personal experience (as someone who is rather unfit, and has always lived in coastal cities), when I visited a hill station at 2.25 km above MSL I didn't really notice anything that made me breathe faster or deeper, so I guess the 20-25% less oxygen actually translates to just about 5% more breathing and 5% less physical strength.

So, suppose we take two athletes:

1. A person who has spent most of his life in towns at 2-2.5 km above sea level
2. A person who has always lived in coastal cities

And suppose both athletes are capable of doing the same sports with identical performance in their hometowns.

I agree that the high-altitude athlete would have the advantage when competing, regardless of whether the athletes were competing at sea level or at high altitude, but suppose we were to have a way to accurately measure peak strength and endurance as two separate parameters.

How big would the advantage (in each of the two parameters) realistically be in favour of the high-altitude athlete, if both of them were competing at mean sea level? My guess is that peak strength is equal and the high-altitude athlete has maybe 10% more endurance. (if endurance is measured as &quot;how long the athlete can do some exercise at a given intensity level for&quot;)

Note: I've chosen the 2-2.5 km range because the highest major cities in my country and in the USA are in that altitude range

Note 2: I made a similar post 2 hours ago but since that post was removed by Reddit's spam filters for linking to the air pressure calculator, I am reposting this and deleting that post.

Text: I've been reading quite a bit about Paxlovid &quot;rebound,&quot; when people test negative at the end of their course of Paxlovid and then test positive again a couple days later. I've read several variations on [this sentiment](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/13-things-to-know-paxlovid-covid-19):

&gt;“This is being closely investigated and we should have more guidance soon,” says Dr. Roberts. “The hypothesis is that the immune system didn’t have a chance to see the full extent of the virus, since Paxlovid suppressed replication early in disease,” he says.

and from Monica Gandhi [here](https://twitter.com/MonicaGandhi9/status/1530782029696348161?s=20&amp;t=unEQlgoW9z-BUDW64SYtfA):

&gt;Rebound seems to be more common if given too early after symptoms because maybe need to see virus a bit to stimulate your adaptive immune response towards it &amp; if given to low-risk patients; agree with my fellow ID doctors here on giving for those at risk

So, what could that mean for the immune response? What exactly does it mean for the immune system to &quot;see the full extent of the virus&quot;? How might it affect antibody production, B cell activation, etc? Will people who take Paxlovid still acquire some amount of immunity after infection?

I am learning about Prokaryotic vs Eukaryotic organisms and their functions and noted that a key difference is that most Prokaryoteshave a cell wall to protect them from bursting due to water absorption. I also remember from prior knowledge knowing that our intestines contain a bunch of prokaryotes to aid in breaking down waste, etc. I was curious and didn't want to bother my professor with these random questions that pop up as I'm reading the textbook, so I figured I'd turn to you kind folks on here to enlighten me on this random burning question of mine:

Are there any diseases that can damage/destroy the cell walls of prokaryotes, causing them to absorb water throughout the body, i.e. the intestines and burst?

The author seems to suggest that between 1970 and today, sugar consumption in the USA has increased 39 times, and attributes this as a major cause the obesity epidemic. He pointed out that in 1970 people consumed slightly more calories but yet were thin.

I completely cut out all sweet tasting products from my life. I still eat around the same number of calories and yet in 6 months I've lost 40lbs of weight. Even when I was dieting and in calorie deficit but still consuming sugar, I struggled to lose weight. So I think there could be something true about this, as I don't even think about dieting nowadays and yet the weight just comes off anyway.

Does anyone here know why or how added sugar specifically would lead to rapid weight gain?

And would the mesh add to the protection? Or is the amount of protection limited by the most effective layer and all additional layers effectively do nothing. 

Bonus question: under what circumstances would I have to ground the faraday cage to properly EMP protect the equipment?

Say we also have very little idea how to relate the outcome to the predictors. Then we did some form of interpretability on the DL model and this led to novel theory/insight (eg. certain amino acid subsequences are highly likely to appear on the surface of the protein once it is folded). 

Are there good case studies of this sort of thing happening? Links to papers would be super appreciated.

 1. You start your periods later in life. You get your first period at 16 rather than 11. Do you have 5 more years of &quot;unlost eggs&quot;?

 2. You're on birth control and only get your period every 2 months (as recommended by your doctor!). Do you lose less eggs this way than someone who has their period every month?

If not, then how do the eggs get lost (I thought they were only lost when you lose blood through your period)?

Electricity- the flow of electrons
Heat - the general movement of particles/molecules.

While these are not perfect definitions, I think they are fairly accurate. 
If you have electrical signals flowing through a copper cable, why can heat not change the bits being transmitted by disrupting the flow?

I realize that heat is a problem in computing, but usually that is at the processing points and affects materials in the computer rather than the signals, right?

Text: So I read that your body generates on average 50mL of blood every day. So what happens to the old blood? Where does it go? 

So blood cells die and deteriorate just like any other type of cell, but what happens to the blood then? Do your other cells absorb the collapsed blood cells? 

I guess I'm also meaning to ask, if your circulatory system is, for the most part, a closed loop system, what happens to blood cells when they die? Where do they go? 

And, this may be the weirdest question of all, what are the long term effects of blood doping? 

So your body has roughly 10 pints of blood in it. You take out a pint and refrigerate it, then wait for your body to regenerate 1 pint worth of blood, bringing your total back up to 10. 

Then you put that first pint *back* into your body. Does your body just permanently have more blood now? Does it sense that there's more than usual and stop producing new blood until the amount returns to normal? What happens there?

Text: I was trimming bushes when I noticed a small thorn stuck itself into my knuckle. My finger looked normal and didn't hurt, so I removed the small thorn and continued trimming. 30 seconds or so later I raise the same hand up again and noticed I had blood all over the finger, and some had dripped onto my pants. By the time I noticed this it had already stopped bleeding.

Did the thorn hit a vein or something, and removing it caused the area to bleed so much until it clotted? The area now has a bruise around a half inch in diameter.

This thorn was incredibly small, and the puncture isn't even noticeable. It's really hard for me to believe such a small &quot;injury&quot; could cause so much blood. How could that much blood escape an invisible little puncture in only 30 seconds?

I'm disappointed I didn't get to witness it.

Text: So, I know it didn't disappear per say, it likely in some aquifer.. but..

I would assume:

1) since we know water was formed by stars and came to earth through meteors or dust, I would assume the distribution of water across planets is roughly proportional to the planet's size. Since mars is smaller than earth, I would assume it would have less than earth, but in portion all the same. 

2) water doesn't leave a planet. So it's not like it evaporates into space 🤪

3) and I guess I assume that Mars and earth formed at roughly the same time. I guess I would assume that Mars and earth have similar starting chemical compositions. Similar rock to some degree? Right?

So how is it the water disappears from the surface of one planet and not the other? Is it really all about the proximity to the sun and the size of the planet? 

What do I have wrong here?

Edit: second kind of question. My mental model (that is probably wrong) basically assumes venus should have captured about the same amount of H2O as earth being similar sizes. Could we assume the water is all there but has been obsorbed into Venus's crazy atmosphere. Like besides being full of whatever it's also humid? Or steam due to the temp?

Text:  

As I understand it, rhizomous plants look like separate plants but are often more like parts of the same plant, or at least clones. And from what I understand about genetics, historically when groups of people interbreed within a small group it can exacerbate the effects of negative genetic traits.

If I were trying to create and sustain a community of plants, and they happened to be rhizomous--like a yarrow plant--would it be enough to transplant several yarrow from one area (which are probably clones) to the target area? Or would it be necessary to go to separate locations to get &quot;different&quot; yarrow plants to seed an area?

If I just plant several of the clone plants would I have &quot;Habsburg lipped&quot; plants in a few years?

Text: My girlfriend and I were having a heated discussion about this.  I was adamant it was based on the fitness of a given variant, but I struggled to explain how that actually plays out in the real world.  She had other ideas that I won't try to explain as I wouldn't be doing her justice.

Can anyone explain this to us, ideally with some actual research papers backing points up?  Ideally with real world examples, e.g. why was Delta pushed out by Omicron and how that plays out on a smaller scale, e.g. even within a single host, and how that interaction changes thing in small but significantly as the macro level. Any help, pointers, etc would be appreciated.

Text: Recently there was a heavy downpour and I was told that the nearby library had to freeze dry books/papers in their magazine. Apparently, there had been a small water leak and parts of their inventory got wet.

I have then been searching online, how the process of freeze drying actually works and found several sources. However, while reading I began wondering: These processes usually create ice crystal inside the material they want to dry. How does paper survive this process?

I can imagine, that the paper isn't too rigid, it can bend and deform given pressure unlike cell walls. Cell walls seem to be rather fragile as ice crystals can break them. However, if paper had been completely drenched/soaked in water, I would expect at least some damage to the paper. But apparently, freeze drying seems to be a very safe method, why is that?

How does the infection work, that both having a &quot;strong&quot; immune system and a &quot;weak&quot; one makes a person extra-vulnerable?

Text: At one end of development we know that amino acids can form spontaneously. Peptides aren’t that much of a stretch after that.
At the other extreme, the strongest produce more offspring and the genes multiply.

How did we get from peptides to a self-reproducing code that leads to the production of peptides that make more copies of the original code?

Has anyone proposed intermediate complexity structures and then organisms that would then lead to simple single cell organisms?

They are all early stage patients as well, not stage 4, “I’m desperate I’ll try anything” patients.  How does the consent for that work? Is it random who receives the drug and who doesn’t? Do patients have to consent to receive the drug or do they just consent to the trial not knowing if they will get it or not? There also seems to be ethical questions re: who receives the drug and who doesn’t? Any help understanding this is appreciated!

Text: **Please read this entire post carefully and format your application appropriately.**

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/or5p3q/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxv/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).
* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)
* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)
* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?
* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

\-------------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

`Username: /u/foretopsail`

`General field: Anthropology`

`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`

`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`

`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`

`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

Timestamped explanation.

&amp;#x200B;

But everything I see online, and everyone I ask online explicitly states that DNA tells cells how to build bodies. 

&amp;#x200B;

If Levin is wrong, and DNA does contain anatomical information, are we able to learn the anatomy of an animal, or even a simple plant *just* by reading the genome? Obviously without comparing it to a related organism.

&gt; &quot;As such, all objects free fall at the same rate regardless of their mass.&quot;

So all objects fall at the same speed regardless of their mass. Therefore, an object's **mass doesn't matter**. Okay.

&gt; &quot;Terminal velocity will depend on the mass, cross sectional area, and drag coefficient of the object as well as the density of the fluid through which the object is falling and gravitational accelleration.&quot;

But now I'm told that **mass do matter**, and that an object with more mass will fall faster?

So do they or do they not fall at different speed...?

I was thinking of incorporating that into the design of the base of one of my miniatures (where I think it has an Apollo-retro meets Space-Roughneck kinda vibe) but then I wasn't entirely sure whether that's even physically plausible...

Obviously cans pressurised for use here on Earth would probably explode or be dangerous in a vacuum - but could you make a canned spray paint for use in space, using less or a different propellant, or would it evaporate too quickly to be controllable?

Title: I recently found out that with enough time, you can dissolve (up to a certain point of) salt into water without ever heating or stirring it. Does this rule also apply to non-crystalline rocks? If you left granite in water for a really long time, would that make it eventually disintegrate as well?

Text: Cactaceae are the only family I know of where almost any species can be successfully grafted to almost any other species. Almost every cactus is capable of producing fertile, hybrids within its genus. Beyond that, it's been found that many cacti are even capable of intergeneric hybridization. Desert cacti are supposed to have diverged and evolved during a worldwide drying event roughly 10-25 mya (I'm assuming the rainforest/vining species evolved at a similar time) This is relatively recent on the scale of plant evolution, is this why they're able to graft and breed so freely? They haven't had enough time to diverge to the point of incompatibility?

Text: I mean to ask this question both in total with all factors as well as if you disregarded humans transporting earth between different areas and the rising water levels due to climate change (which I guess answers the total, but I am not sure).

What I do know is that volcanoes erupting and the lava cooling down can create new islands, so I wondered whether more earth, sand and mass eroded into the sea or more surfaced due to lava.

When disregarding the continents and only looking at all islands (including new ones) it would also be a very interesting statistic. I have for example heard that the tallest volcano of spain on Tenerife was once a lot taller, but collapsed due to not being stable enough. I would guess that this made the total area over water bigger but reduced the mass over water.

Text: You often hear that a rock is 1 billion years old or 300 million years old or whatever age it may be. What is the starting point for a rock’s age? I assume it might vary based on the type of rock, like maybe volcanic rocks are “born” when they emerge from a volcano, or sedimentary rocks are “born” when they harden from whatever swampy material they were before, but I’m not sure, and Googling mainly tells me that Dwayne Johnson was born in 1972, which is interesting but not helpful. Since just about every rock is made of material that has been around since the Big Bang, it’s confusing to know what science considers the start of a rock’s existence. What defines a rock’s birthday?

 I mean, there are some claims that due to how rigid the reinforced frame in heavy vehicles is, one is more susceptible to organ damage due to how kinetic energy is transferred. 

In case of lighter ones, they are intentionally made in a way that makes the body and chassis &quot;absorb&quot; the energy in order to reduce the damage the crash inflicts on the passengers. 

I guess the outcome of a collision could rely on the differences in weight between the participants.

TLDR: would a heavy vehicle be a better option safety wise? Or are there other factors in play?

Text: The way I understand it, vaccines use a dead, or weakened, virus. Some vaccines use only parts of a virus (or bacteria). And in the case of the Covid vaccines, they use mRNA technology. 

Now, the way I understand it, once this is introduced into the body, the immune system reacts and neutralizes the antigen. So, when the antigen enters the body a second time, the immune system reacts much quicker. I also understand that microbes can mutate, which has an effect on the vaccine's potency. This is why we have to get a flu shot every year, because the virus mutates. 

However, in the cases of Smallpox and Polio, we have managed to eradicate these diseases by way of vaccines. So, my question is it possible that, with vaccines, we were able to eliminate some diseases with vaccines, but not others? Did these other viruses just not have a chance to mutate? How would we get to the point where we don't let the flu or Covid to mutate? 

Please no &quot;Big Pharma&quot; conspiracies. I just want to know people's thoughts from a scientific standpoint. Thanks.

Text: Note that I'm not talking about &quot;growing the *most*&quot; (i.e. smallest baby size to adult size ratio). I'm talking about &quot;growing the *fastest*&quot;.

As of right now, I think it's the red kangaroo.

[This](https://www.nwf.org/Magazines/National-Wildlife/2010/Worlds-Fastest-Growing-Animal) and [this](https://www.ferris.edu/card-riley-center/Kids_Corner/marsupials.htm) say a red kangaroo is 1 gram at birth, and [the red kangaroo's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_kangaroo) [states that female red kangaroos can be of reproductive age (i.e. &quot;adulthood&quot;) as soon as 18 months](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_kangaroo#Reproduction) (but [that they weigh, at most, 88 pounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_kangaroo#Description)).

Using this information, let's say the following:

1. 1 year = 12 months = 365 days
2. 18 months = 365 \* 1.5 days = 547.5 days
3. 88 pounds / 1 gram = 39,916.1286

Plugging these values into [this exponent calculator](https://www.omnicalculator.com/math/exponent) tells me that, for a female red kangaroo to grow from its birth weight to its weight at adulthood in 547.5 days, it must multiply its body weight by 1.01954x (101.954%) per day.

Alternative, reversing this, and assuming the upper bound of red kangaroo reproductive age (5 years/1825 days), and the lower bound of female red kangaroo body weight (40 pounds), that means said female red kangaroo must multiply its body weight by 1.005387x per day (100.5387%) in order to grow from 1 gram to 40 pounds in 1825 days.

**Are there any mammals** **^((not animals,)** [***^(mammals)***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal)***)*** **that grow faster than this?** Right now, I think the red kangaroo takes the cake, seemingly growing 7.1x to *\~1,170x* its body weight within a year.

Text: Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Physics, Astronomy, Earth and Planetary Science**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for 'X' were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;.

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

That said, we have an effective method against keeping people from getting sick from any possible accidental or other recurrence of the disease, so why don’t we continue using it widely just in case? I’ve also seen that it is/was effective in suppressing other “pox” diseases (eg, monkeypox), which seems like a big benefit.

So why did we just…stop? Were there major costs and/or side effects that made it not worth it? Or is it kinda just a big victory lap that we might regret?

Obviously seen responses to that such as [this one](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.07030454) but not quite getting as clear of a picture as I'd like for my own understanding.

So far I've mostly seen studies that discuss how this isn't the case and that anti-depressants are effective at treating depression but also seen a few that have shown either neutral or negative results with regards to suicidality specifically.

Is it just the case that anti-depressants increase motivation to do things, and while this is largely a positive there are some cases where it increases motivation to act on suicidal ideations? Seen some evidence that suggests these ideations may just be a potential side effect.

Obviously what I've read so far supports the idea that anti-depressants are more of a positive on the whole than a negative. Would however appreciate if anyone could provide a bit more focus or clarity in terms of what the current medical consensus is with regards to suicide.

Or I guess - build an expression using rational numbers using the operators of addition, multiplication, and taking roots - can such an expression always be condensed to involve just one root?

Text: As many of you already know, the Quetzalcoatlus was the largest flying animal to have ever taken to the skies. According to Wikipedia, the Quetzalcoatlus was well adapted for the ground as well as the air. It says that the Quetzalcoatlus's main diet was smaller dinosaurs that it could pluck from the ground, akin to today's stork. However, there is one sentence that really caught my eye:

&quot;Though Quetzalcoatlus, like other pterosaurs, was a quadruped when on the ground, Quetzalcoatlus and other azhdarchids have fore and hind limb proportions more similar to modern running ungulate mammals than to their smaller cousins, implying that they were uniquely suited to a terrestrial lifestyle&quot;

The mention of Quetzalcoatlus's limb structures being similar to known running animals is really fascinating to me. Could a Quetzalcoatlus give chase to a small animal on foot if it had to, galloping after it's prey like a horse?

Text: I understand why we can’t see infrared light, because it’s way less energetic than visible light, but ultraviolet is even higher energy and I thought it would still make sense for it to excite our retinas.

The only answer I can find is “because your eyes only see blue light”, but that doesn’t really answer the question of how or why that mechanism actually works.

Text: I've been thinking about stem cell therapies lately, particularly for arthritis (not me, a friend) or as a potential theoretical Alzheimer's treatment. I'm aware that stem cells differentiate into the types of cells that need to be presented in the body from certain centres, and that they actually stick around with us all our lives. Now they are able to be used to restore a friend's knees back to an amazing degree (though not perfect). But if you received stem cell therapy from stem cells harvested from you when you were younger and put on ice, would the therapies be more effective? Is there a scientific reason to limit the number of rounds of stem cell therapy you can do, and would fully restored joints have virtually the same effective lifetime as the amount of time it took to get arthritis in the first place since adulthood?

I think these questions could be answered by understanding more about stem cells, their life cycles, and their continued availability in our bodies for treatments in later life or in times of need.

Also, is there a way to differentiate the fields of stem cell research looking into stem cells in our bodies day-to-day or those in foetuses? I hate to see people get hung up on the stem cell research debate by citing the morality of biopsying foetuses, when we could be researching the stem cells we live with everyday and celebrating groundbreaking advances in treatments and therapies.

It has actually given me incredible hopes for the future to see how effectively my friend bounced back after 2 rounds of stem cell therapy, and I'm saddened to not see more people I know with serious arthritis not look into the therapy. Is there something inherently prohibitive to the procedures? Surely: biopsy. Isolate. Culture. Get patient. Knock out. Poke where bad. Bed rest. Has the potential to be incredibly cost-effective and rapid.

In regard to Alzheimer's treatment: I've heard and observed that Alzheimer's is a form of dementia resulting from physical deterioration of the brain. Why not poke with a large dose with the appropriate stem cells?

This is a lot I know, if it's too much to explain I'm open to doing some extra reading. Thanks in advance

So that has me wondering, if you had this very unethical  experiment where you could inject babies with some hormone cocktails, how much could you control by just controlling their hormones.

For example: Would you have enough control to have a baby turn into 6ft tall adult, with wide hips a big butt, large boobs and a 10 inch penis? Or how much of that would be coded into the DNA?

Text: I'm interested in the chemical reactions that happen between antioxidants and free radicals. There seems to be very little explanation on the internet of the actual chemistry that happens, and if there is it seems a bit too complicated for me.

Free radical = species with unpaired electron. Are all free radicals electrically neutral (not positive nor negative?)

From what I can see, antioxidants are also free radicals. They give an unpaired electron to a free radical. After this, both species have no unpaired electrons. Would they both have a charge of +1 or -1 now?

This makes antioxidants 'good for you' because they result in the free radical now having no unpaired electron, and there are no more chain reactions that occur. I am also curious: when a free radical takes an electron from a different molecule, what makes this reaction 'dangerous' for the body? Which molecule now would go on to be unstable and cause more dangerous reactions, is it the free radical that has been reduced or the other molecule that has been oxidised?

Text: My understanding of vapour pressure is that it is the pressure exerted by a vapour above a liquid when at equilibrium. Physically, this arises because some molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid phase in to the gas phase, and at equilibrium the number of molecules vapourising is the same as the number condensing. 

My question is does the vapour pressure depend on the external pressure? For example, if a volatile solvent was placed in a sealed flask, and it was pressurised with an inert gas, would the additional gas molecules hinder the evaporation from the liquid phase?

Text: I can probably understand why eating or smelling something nasty would provoke a gag reflex and induce vomiting. I guess when there is something in your body that couldn’t be accepted, gagging and vomiting act as ways to expel it. I could be misinformed so pardon my ignorance. 

However it dawned on me that even without taste or smell, we can experience the same physical reactions. For instance, I find spit, pee, vomit, certain kinds of food to be disgusting. Looking at these things can make me gag, tear up, and make me feel like I need to vomit. Even thinking about them alone can sometimes provoke such reactions. 

Why does that happen? Why does the body resort to a gag reflex and vomiting when the disgusting things aren’t directly affecting the body, especially internally? Is it because the brain already associates smell, texture, and taste with these objects we’ve come to experience so merely looking or thinking about these objects is similar to us being directly impacted by it?

Text: I’m a gamer, so I have had a firsthand look into the phenomenon of miniaturizing data storage.  My first console was the 8-Bit NES, then came the SNES and SEGA Genesis whose cartridges were a bit smaller but held more data, then the Nintendo 64 with cartridges still smaller and still more powerful.  Handheld systems were the same; Game Boy Advance cartridges could hold more data than original Game Boy cartridges while also being smaller, while DS cartridges were smaller and mightier still.  Upgraded versions of SNES games could fit on GBA cartridges, while upgraded versions of N64 games could fit on DS cartridges, and upgraded versions of GameCube and Wii games could fit on 3DS cartridges.  There have been some deviations from the “smaller and more data-rich” trends; for example the GameCube used miniature CDs while the following Wii and Wii-U used regular-sized CDs, but then it was back to cartridges for the Switch, and ones nearly as small as 3DS cartridges, to boot!  The home computer industry is similar; a USB stick holds a lot more data than floppy disks did, and external hard drives I can buy now have a lot more space than the larger, internal hard drive my PC shipped with.

Impressive development, but I do often wonder how far this can go.  I know next to nothing about the mechanics of computer hardware (come to think of it, I’m not sure if this should really be tagged as computing rather than engineering), so I have no idea how hard it is to keep condensing all of this data capacity into smaller and smaller packages.  So to anyone who knows, what’s up with this, and is there anything that will eventually make it physically impossible to shrink data devices any further?

Text: When driving through extemely heavy rainfall, I noticed that rain appears to have roughly coherent torrents (or &quot;streaks&quot;) of higher density (on the scale of meters). Why is that? Is it an optical illusion? The nature of pseudo-randomness (but then why would the &quot;period&quot; be as big as a meter)? Is it some sort of &quot;oscillation&quot; of wind?

I don't think I've ever noticed this with regular rain, so maybe it happens only with very heavy rain? The doplets were definitely big.

If I set a marble on a basketball, that was spinning west to east, between the “equator” of the ball and the pole, and let it drop, wouldn’t the marble move east?

Text: The harmonic series is 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/*n*, and it is well-known to diverge to infinity. Now, if you square each of the terms, you get 1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16 + 1/25 + 1/*n*^2, which is well-known to converge to π^(2)/6. 

What I’m wondering is if there is a real number *y*, between 1 and 2, where the sum of 1/*n^y* will diverge to infinity if *y* &lt; *x* and converge if *y* &gt; *x*. That is, is there a point that separates divergence and convergence of these series?

It seems to me like there should be, but I have no idea how to begin to calculate it, and I would also not be too terribly surprised if it didn’t exist. I wouldn’t be surprised either if this has been asked before, but I’ve had no success in finding anything.

Text: This question was inspired by my understanding of immune response: A host becomes infected &gt; pathogen replicates until disease &gt; immune response &gt; eradication. At some point between infection and eradication there exists a critical mass of the pathogen such that the host becomes infectious.

An immunized host has memory cells that reduce immune response time. Is that shortened response time enough to prevent the host from becoming infectious before the pathogen is eradicated?

I figure this varies wildly from pathogen so let's just stick to COVID-19 (although additional examples would be great).

A few more things:

First, I'm out of my area of expertise (obviously) so please excuse any misuse of terminology, and please point it out.
Second, please don't hold back with your answers. If I wanted a simple explanation for something as if I was five years old I'd go to another sub (my post was auto deleted for referencing it). If I don't understand something I can go look it up. Hit me with your best shot =)

Text: I was reading earlier today about the kinds of ailments that bone marrow transplants are used to treat (as I am thinking about signing up on the registry to donate), and I noted that in the case of leukaemia, chemotherapy or radiotherapy is used to completely destroy the recipient's immune system first.

However, whilst relatively good, there are still figures that suggest that survivability over the years following treatment is not always that high, some still slip through the gaps.

But what causes these deaths after transplants over a long time since the procedure? Do the recipients somehow reject and attack the donated marrow? Does the new marrow eventually fail? But the recipient's immune system was destroyed, why can't the received marrow/immune system exist indefinitely, or a repeat/follow-up transplant procedure performed further down the line?

A follow-up question I have is are there grounds for marrow transplants to be used to treat immunodeficiency disorders such as CVID? I also read that some investigation has been performed into treating MS with bone marrow transplantation.

This is a long one, thanks in advance!

Text: Every single explanation of non-polar/polar interactions essentially says “non-polar substances have random slight charges that constantly change across the molecule and so are not attracted to the dipoles of water molecules.” I can’t, however, find any explanation to why the two substances (lets say water and oil) actually seperate. I saw a video of someone mixing the oil and water in space and the result was globules of oil randomly dispersed through the water. So in the case of separation of oil and water on earth is it just a case of the water molecules being attracted to each other, “slipping” past the oil and sitting at the bottom of the container due to density and in turn forcing the oil together?

Text: At an interested engineer, totally not a biologist level, I can smell things.  When I try to understand how smell works, though, I get confused.  I've heard a couple of answers which I'm not convinced by, so thought I'd get some clarity.

* Resonating bonds between atoms in molecules.  This sounds semi plausible, but it doesn't account for handedness, where (AIUI) for instance a left hand identical arrangement of atoms smells of lemon and the same atoms arranged right-handed smell of mint.

* That suggests shape is the driver, which seems compelling, but then why do brand new molecules we never evolved for have a smell?  Not perfume blends, that's obvious, but molecularly.  If we don't have a receptor for a molecule shape, how could we smell it, and how could we evolve a receptor for something that doesn't exist?

* Smell buds, and every aroma is a unique combination of the nose equivalent of bitter/sweet/salt/acid/umami.  This seems pretty unconvincing to me as with shape alone - how could novel molecules smell?

* Nose as a diffraction column.  Doesn't seem intuitive, but unique graphs for aromas at least includes the possibility of novel molecules having a smell, but we return to the handedness question.

What am I missing?  Am I overthinking it all, missing something obvious?  I mean it seems like something we should know, but I'm not seeing consensus.

Thanks for your ideas about this, it's troubled me a while!

* I was vaccinated in August 2021.
* I was infected by Covid-19 in October 2021. No hospital visit or monoclonal treatment required.
* Antibodies are said to be good for 90 days. 
* I chose not to get any boosters. 
* I have not been as “safe” as one could be, and have been in largely unmasked crowds on occasion. I have been to stores, out with friends, on vacation, etc. — always following Covid guidelines, but when given the option not to mask up, I have chosen not to. 
* Luckily, to my knowledge, I have not been infected by Covid-19 a second time. 

If your body produces antibodies after infection, is it possible that continued exposure to Covid would ensure your body continues to produce antibodies?

Why would continual exposure to Covid *not* act similarly to a booster?

Text: How would we know the difference? 

It seems a very important point to understand how to prevent and treat depression. The extend to which depression is being talked about almost as a purely physical ailment like a broken leg or a weak heart in modern culture has helped destigmatize it but it just makes me wonder if this is really the right way to think about it. 

Thinking about it as a syndrome seems to put the problem on the shoulders of the individual rather than their enviroment (and vice versa).

Any input would be appreciated. Maybe some neurobiological insight?

Edit: arguably this is a psychology or even philosophy question but I'm specifically interested to know if any neurobiological research has been done on this.

Text: Various rockets use dinitrogen tetroxide as a hypergolic oxidizer, including the Russian Proton and the Chinese Long-March 2 rocket families. However, there have been incidents of hypergolic-fuelled rockets crashing or expending contaminated stages, releasing bright orange clouds of N2O4 into the environment, including in proximity to populated areas. When these accidents occur, the relevant governments are usually pretty hush-hush about the whole incident, so it's difficult to what exactly happens to these populated areas after a local contamination. Incidents recorded by NASA in America seem to only be relatively minor spills occurring during fuelling of planes or rockets, not full-on environmental contamination.

To be more specific about my question if it's necessary. If a large quantity (let's say, a full rocket tank, 200 tonnes) of N2O4 (or something similar) is released into the atmosphere just above a town, how difficult is it to contain and/or clean? Is it so bad that the soil and water are made irreperably carcinogenic for years? Or can it be acceptably cleaned up before the end of next month? Or maybe we can just wait for it to 'decay' and it will go away on its own? I'm not a chemistry expert, so I don't know, and I don't where how to find out.

The reason I'm asking is because I want to write a story featuring a hypergolic-fuelled rocket exploding above a town. I want to make sure I get every fact correct. I know that the N2O4 will explode on contact with alcohols (and apparently also paper and adhesives) and start fires, but I'm more concerned about the chemical contamination. How quickly could people live in that town again?

Text: I was driving past an equestrian place the other day while there was a show happening. I drove past again the next day and all the horses were back in their fields quietly munching grass, and it got me wondering whether they had any memory of the previous day's events.

We know that animals are able to remember which plants or other animals are good to eat, and which ones are dangerous, but I wouldn't call this episodic memory. We also know that many animals can be trained to perform a certain action which they associate with a reward, but I doubt a dog is remembering what happened in training when told to sit - it's become an instinct. Conversely we know that abused dogs will exhibit fear of humans, of men, or of particular objects because of negative experiences associated with these things, but are the dogs remembering specific times that they were hurt by these things, or is it again just a learned instinct?

When we as humans recall a memory, we are to all intents and purposes experiencing a dulled down abbreviated version of the original sensory inputs that created it (although obviously the sensory neurons from the body aren't involved this time). We know that it's only a memory, but I'm wondering whether an animal would be able to make this distinction. Perhaps the horses in my introduction would become really confused as to why they were eating grass but at the same time being ridden around, hearing a crowd but at the same time not seeing one, then suddenly seeing a crowd but not hearing any noise, then chewing on grass again but at the same time feeling a bit in their mouths. Do animals possess the intelligence to distinguish memories from live experiences, or is this a reason why they can't possess episodic memory, because it would mess with their heads too much?

Certain pathways clearly lost associated SNPs while others gained some. What does this mean for these genetic pathways to have more or less associated SNPs?

Does each pathway correspond to a singular trait or set of traits?

Does having more SNPs mean these traits are expressed to a higher degree / magnitude?

For example, hsa04114 	Oocyte meiosis

Or

Text: Let’s say if you are in a store and a single airborne COVID virus gets into your system. Would you get less sick than someone who gets directly sneezed on and a thousand COVID viruses get in your system? 

I’m curious if it only takes one single virus and the amount doesn’t really matter since in both cases the virus would still multiply a lot anyways.

Text: For the Riemann zeta function at positive even values, we have the well known closed expression in terms of powers of pi and the Bernoulli numbers. I know there are no proven expressions for odd values, but are there similar formulas that are at least empirically valid up to high precision and could be plausible candidate for an exact formula? Has there been a systematic search?

Text: I ask this thinking that some test or tests might have been done to determine how birds adapt to micro-gravity. Not in a vaccuum, of course. 

Can birds adapt? Can they learn to navigate in this environment? I think of water birds, who can dive and swim underwater. If any tests showed chaotic results, should one anticipate that they would normalize over time? 

Sorry if I'm asking some easy questions in the course of asking my main one.

If since matter in a vacuum is limited, I’m assuming the oxygen and water will be used first as atoms with more volume but less atomic density, and therefore the process will only be able to equalize to the  state of matter not completely rust if there’s more solute than solvent.

e.g. 5\` GUCGAUGCUUGGUAGUAAG......... 3\`

The only potential initiation site is AUG, so why do we say that this could encode 3 different proteins?

Precisely what is meant by &quot;clinical effect&quot; in that context?

We had a blast and so we're back again! So please ask us any questions any of you have to do with science or technology and how they affect your life. There are no silly questions - ask us anything and we will try to give an easy-to-understand answer and, wherever possible, provide some further sources to enable you to do your own research/reading.


Our goal is simply to advance everyone's understanding of science, engineering, and technology and to help people be better informed about the issues likely to affect them and their families.

**More info / Longer read:**
CSES is a registered charity in the UK, founded in 1920. We're a volunteer group of over 250 members and our key strength is our diversity and interdisciplinary expertise. Our members come from a variety of educational, social, and economic backgrounds, from industry and academia and a multitude of age groups, representing groups from the millennials all the way to the Silent Generation (our oldest member being 98)!

There has been growing dis-information globally in the last 20 years. Today's global interconnectedness, while being hugely beneficial for making information easily accessible to everyone, has made it ever more difficult to determine 'truth' and who to trust. As an independent charity, not affiliated or biased to any particular group, but with broad knowledge we are here to answer any questions you may have and to hopefully point you to further reading!

Our goal is simply to answer as many of your questions as we can - but we aren't able to give advice on things - sorry! We will also be clear where what we are saying is the experience-based opinion of someone in our team.

So, Reddit... Ask us anything!

CSES will draw from its large pool of volunteers to answer your questions, however some of the people standing by to answer comments are:

+ **Professor David Humber**: Over 30 years' experience as a researcher, lecturer and senior university manager, specialising in immuno-biology and the life sciences.

Title: Can we detect the effect of economic recessions, depressions, etc. on the statistical distribution of e.g. height?

Text: I figure that (economic) hard times equal, at least for some populations/groups, lower caloric consumption than usual, which could have some consequences for body size, in particular, height.

In particular if it happens to children or young adults still in the progress of growing, which i figure would be more sensitive to changes in intake(?), and therefore prevent them from reaching their full &quot;potential&quot;. 

Are there any data indicating that, e.g. &quot;population group X experienced economic difficulties in the year Y, which was reflected in a statistically detectable deviation/anomaly in the distribution for height for the group some N years later, compared to how it is normally&quot;

Text: If we look at the intensity vs wavelength graph in compton scattering experiment...,we see two peaks, one due to scattering from free electrons and the other due to scattering from tightly bound electrons.

But that doesn't make the intensities at other wavelengths zero... They are there, non zero but small... I suspect they appear due to scattering from no so tightly bounded electrons. 

But my question is why should they be so low? Like why is the concentration of free electron scattering and tight electron scattering so high compared to the rest(the no so tight electron scattering)...?

One of these is the unfolding argument. Can't seem to find any literature on how Zekis´ theory of the disunity of consciousness relates to this argument. He provides no function for consciousness, is he therefore subject to the unfolding argument, and could be considered a casual structure theory such as Lammes´ recurrent processing theory (2006) and Tononis´ information integration theory (2004)?

Text: I need to settle a debate with someone. To be clear, we are talking about your average, everyday pendulum like you'd find in a clock or by tying a washer to the end of a string, standing on earth. 

From what I've always learned, the equation T = 2π√(L/g) defines the period of a pendulum. Neither the mass of the bob nor the amplitude have any affect on the period of the pendulum, only the length of said pendulum can change the amplitude.

This person whom I'm debating is stating that with a &quot;huge change in amplitude&quot; (but didn't specify what &quot;huge change&quot; meant) the period will change. As I understand it, acceleration increases proportionally with amplitude and therefore the two cancel each other out.

When I brought that up, they said, &quot;an elliptic integral usually approximated with a series far too long for me to get into.&quot; and gave no other explanation. I have never studied this. I've asked for an explanation, but he's gone dark other than to say, &quot;it's too complicated to get into.&quot; 

So, can a &quot;huge&quot; change in amplitude change the period, and what exactly did he mean by the elliptical integral comment?

Text: So I'm reading [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14643-z) and have a question about principal component analysis. In figure 2 (a-c) the authors use PCA to decompose a response matrix based on trial-averaged fluorescence, direction-selectivity index and 4 temporal frequency values into a two-dimensional graph with axes PC1 and PC2. Based on this they identify clusters of neurons with similar preferred temporal frequencies. I have a couple of questions here:

1. What do the axes PC1 and PC2 indicate? I'm having trouble properly understanding the concept of PCA. As far as I'm aware and can put into words, PC1 represents the biggest portion of variance in the data, folllowed by PC2? Meaning differences along the x axis have more weight than differences along the y axis. But I can't seem to properly grasp the meaning of these axes as anything tangible.
2. How do they identify TF-based clusters in this graph? How are they distinguished coming from figure 2b? Why couldn't they be clustered based on fluorescence or DSI, as I don't see any units other than PC1 and PC2 in fig. 2b?

Text: Keeping aquariums, including crawfish, shrimp, and crabs, I have obviously noticed that crawfish visually look a lot more like a shrimp than the average crab. In fact, at the store I work at, it takes a trained eye to distinguish between young crawfish and shrimp. I am assuming much of this applies to young lobsters as well, though all the ones I’ve seen have more distinguishable claws from an early age.

Anyways, I am trying to understand oceanic evolution through time and I’ve read that decapoda evolved into reptantia (lobsters and crabs) and natantia (shrimp). Does this suggest that lobsters are more closely related to crabs than shrimp, or am I misunderstanding something?

Title: Why was the rise in HIV infection incidence in the Eastern Europe And Central Asia region so much higher than that of any other regions in 2010-2020?

This region seems to really stand out in this graph from UNAIDS. Over the last decade, the only other region with a rise in incidence was Middle East And North Africa, but it was only a 7% increase, vs +43% in Eastern Europe And Central Asia.     



[https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media\_asset/2021-global-aids-update\_en.pdf](https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/2021-global-aids-update_en.pdf)

I gathered from this document by UNAIDS that the major disease burden in this region is on IV drug users, and the main hurdles to controlling the disease are punitive laws and social stigma (p.336, 338). But why is this region handling the disease so much worse than other regions, specifically Middle East And North Africa?           

It seems that these 2 regions have similarly oppressive political climate and legislature (Table 18.2 &amp; 19.2). The minorities also appears to be similarly marginalized. And according to the document, Eastern Europe And Central Asia had more resources available than Middle East And North Africa did (\~40% vs 20% of the resource needed for achieving 2025 goals) (Fig. 18.10 &amp; 19.6).      



I understand that this is probably a complicated issue with a myriad of factors at play. And I must admit that I do not know much about the political and cultural situation of these regions. To sum up, my question is: 

&gt;What are the major impetus to the remarkably worse HIV control in Eastern Europe And Central Asia, as compared to Middle East And North Africa, despite having a seemingly similar socio-political environment and higher resource availability?

Text: I was hearing people the other day claim that the accumulation of mutations caused by lower mortality rates (thus causing a wider variety of individuals with mutations to survive and reproduce) would result in an overall reduction of average human intelligence, over time.

Just wanted to get feedback from actual geneticists on that claim, as it is expounded more or less in this paper: [https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00361](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00361). I think this sounds like a load of eugenic bullshit (and that the idea of a co-ocurrence of a dysgenic trend with the Flynn effect is methodologically unsound), but I don't think I have enough knowledge of the subject to actually assert so. 

Is this a fringe theory, or is there any support for it in current genetic studies?

If we grew something else there (like apples or corn) would they be high in potassium? Or is it something about the way bananas extract minerals from the ground? I assume they are not 'creating' the potassium - it has to be in the ground already and being pulled into the fruit from the plant roots. Right?

Text: I noticed today that when using two different brands of synthetic fertilizers with almost identical NPK levels I was getting a significantly higher EC. the PK levels of one brand of nutrient were higher but I did that math for both nutrient companies in order to ensure I was using identical amounts of RAW NPK. I found that I needed to use significantly more nutrients from one brand to get the same levels of raw nitrogen phosphorus and potassium than the other. After adding the nutrients of the &quot;low quality&quot; brand I noticed the EC was significantly higher (2.3) than the &quot;higher quality&quot; nutrients (1.9) but I'm still adding the same amount of RAW NPK to each tank. 
So my question is this, what exactly is causing the EC to be higher from one brand to the next, is it all the filler from using more nutrients to achieve the same NPK causing this? Or do cheaper/lower quality nutrients use more Iron boron calcium magnesium etc to synthesize their nutrients?

Text: So I've been trying to investigate these New Age claims that say our heart is basically an EMF transmitter but didn't find any convincing proof that this is actually true.

Obviously the heart operates through all sorts of phenomena, electricity being involved as well. Where there is current, there are electromagnetic fields. So it's obvious that SOME field could be detected if we would have a sensitive enough device.

But the problem is their claims seem especially outlandish. The research linked below argues that this EMF can even be detected several feet away, which sounds a bit crazy. If the heart would've had such a strong EMF, it would've been more common knowledge in our society. I mean, maybe they are kind of right. After all, they aren't mentioning any concrete values, they just say it's 100 times stronger than the brain's field (which I also doubt).

[https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-hearts-magnetic-field-which-is-the-strongest-rhythmic-field-produced-by-the-human\_fig11\_293944391](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-hearts-magnetic-field-which-is-the-strongest-rhythmic-field-produced-by-the-human_fig11_293944391)

I first heard about this claim here: [https://youtu.be/ta4w28IlzPE?t=1410](https://youtu.be/ta4w28IlzPE?t=1410)

This man named Joe Dispenza was making a lot of sense up to the timestamp I've selected.  
When he said the heart produces something similar to a WiFi signal, 3 meters wide, that's when my &quot;quack alarm&quot; started going off.

What's your opinion? Is all of this pseudoscience or is there any truth to it?  
Do you have any research to back up these claims?

Text: So often people talk about what animals are closest to us (chimps, monkeys, etc) but I've never really heard of someone talking about the most unrelated animal to us. So, in terms of what would be commonly referred to as an animal in every-day talk (so no single-celled organisms or things like that), what is furthest from us?

Edit: For clarity, by &quot;animal in every-day talk&quot; I just mean no single celled organisms, bacteria, etc. Things that are just so obviously far from us because they're so simple. Things like insects, sponges, etc all count. I eliminate them simply because while most likely correct, it's just not an interesting answer, and most people not in the scientific field wouldn't consider a bacteria to even be an animal in any way. For the sake of what discussion can be drawn from this, I want more interesting answers than the very obvious.

After reading around, the common phrase I come across is that it &quot;lowers the refractive index of the skin&quot; to permit greater penetration of radiation, but what does that phrase mean??

My thought is more inclined to the tanning oil refracting light like how immersion oil in light microscopy would refract light, but what does that have to do with the refractive index of skin?

The other explanation is in the moisturizing property of the oil sustaining the substrate accumulation for the melanocytes.

Text: I have messed around quite a bit electrolyzing materials in order to generate hydrogen, oxygen and chlorine. I had very limited means and it was just a hobby project, but a consistent problem I had and I saw others having on the internet is the corrosion of the anode. Even stainless steel or graphite could not stand the test of time and I can imagine platinum electrodes are prohibitively expensive for industrial scale. Other options such as Mixed-metal-oxide seems too expensive for gigawatt scale production as well. Most hydrogen manufacturing websites only mention marketing buzzwords (&quot;ultra high density&quot; / &quot;innovative corrosion resistance&quot;) and no technical details. Perhaps it's all a bit of a trade secret, but I am quite curious!  


Sidenote, I can imagine it getting messed up when messing with NaCl electrolysis with chlorine and carbon steel electrodes. But if I recall correctly even NaOH solutions with stainless corroded after some time. So my question focusses specifically on hydrogen production.

Text: Hey there

In general, stars are moving away from us and, in combination with the doppler effect, this gives us redshift. When we look at stars with our eyes, they look more red than they actually are. When a picture is taken, the star looks more red than it actually is. This leads to two ways to represent a star in a picture (like [this one](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NXmL6bbh7QMA3xxfuu56uZ.png)):

1. The way a star looks for a human on earth (non-colour corrected for redshift)
2. The way a star *actually* looks (colour corrected for redshift). It would display the colour of a star like the star actually sends out.

And so rises my question: are pictures of stars colour-corrected for redshift? Do the pictures display a star like a human would see it, or how it looks in reality (as if you were right next to it)?

For example, in the picture linked above, the star at the centre is just a white spot. But let's take the orange star to the left bottom of the middle. Is it actually that red (colour-corrected)? Or does it look that red because of red shift (not colour-corrected)?

In school, in dutch, I learned the term &quot;Emission spectrum&quot; of a star (almost always hydrogen is used). I think the official english term is RVS? You can use that and the default (&quot;recorded&quot; on earth) to calculate the amount of redshift. If you know how much redshift there is, you can colour-correct a picture for redshift. So if you supply a picture of a star and it's RVS, you can do some calculations and color-correct a picture. However, when searching the web, I didn't find a single &quot;tool&quot; that could do this. Why isn't there any?

I just had this topic in physics class at school and I came up with these questions after his lesson and my teacher didn't know the answer, so here I am, asking it to you people. I hope you can shed some light!

Text: If I understand correctly, the further we peer into the cosmos, the further back in time we see. In that case, wouldn't the cosmic microwave background radiation and the first stars and galaxies then infer that the universe we observe is all there is?

I can understand that there could be a causal horizon, given the perceived flatness of our universe. However, I am hoping that someone can help differentiate between the &quot;firewall&quot; of the CMB and the speculative universe beyond what we can see with telescopes.

Since coal is the compressed remains of (mostly plant) organisms in the distant past, does that mean that such metals used to be much more abundant in the tissue of life on earth?

If not, is the process of how they got there understood?  If so, does that imply that life on earth used to be more adapted to elevated levels of heavy metals?

I've been watching Blue Planet II, on the second episode they were showing the deepest parts of the ocean. It showed lava vents and volcanic discharge and it got me thinking that it must eventually run out of the core, or lava. 

But if that's how islands are created, and I just assume that continents are massive islands. So how does that not run out?

Text: I don't understand how the covering up behavior may have started: was it a single individual cat (or an ancestor of it) that started to do it (was it a genius among its peers?) and therefore obtained an evolutionary advantage that got passed down to more and more generations and in the process it became hardwired in the genes?

I took this example because it's an easy one but I do wonder how many other complex behaviors started and became species-wide (e.g. weaving the web for spiders, mating dances for birds etc).

Secondly, I understand that animals that do not spend their infancy and maturing phase with members of their own species may lack awareness and priming of social behaviors, but how far does this stretch and when do genes start to play a bigger role?

I've learned that it is strongly recommended to replace plastic when it comes to food containers. However, I have a few questions about the use of plastics in every day life that I have found opposing answers for when searching and I'd appreciate your take on:

1. Are plastic containers relatively safe (with or without BPA) as long as they're not used to heat up food? Is not using them for storing food in the fridge or at room temperature still highly recommended or are the risks exaggerated?
2. Do plastic containers/trays/storage bins (with or without BPA) for clothes, personal items, and paper pose similar risks? Should plastic be avoided to store and organize items in desks, closets, shelfs, etc, too?
3. Do the risks of doing 1 and 2 increase for a person with actual hormone problems?

Text: I have a mere armchair understanding of particle physics. Part of what I know is that there are no free quarks in nature. They always have to be bound into hadrons or some kind of theoretical high-energy quark soup. Trying to force quarks that are already bound apart simply results in pair-production of more quarks from the energy you put in trying to separate them.

For me, it raises the question, do we actually *know* whether individual quarks *have* so-conventioned &quot;fractional&quot; electric charge? Is it really a property that a hypothetical free quark (whatever that would mean) would possess, or could it perhaps only be an emergent property of the group? Is it even meaningful to distinguish between these scenarios?

To clarify, my goal with this is not to speculate on what it *could* be, or to dwell on the philosophical. My questions are:

* Is this even know*able*?
 * If yes, *do* we know?
     * If yes, which is it, and *how* do we know that?
 * If no, or if it is ambiguous/meaningless, could you explain why?

Or did we cross our fingers hoping they’d make it through and back without too much radiation damage to their bodies?

Text: What I know is that the Poincaire group is characterised by, like, 9-10 commutation relations. And every field, before quantisation, is a vector space on which there must be representations of the Poincaire group defined as operators.

For instance, the operator e^(xd/dy-y/d/dx) is a representation of a member belonging to this group, and this operator acts on the vector space of fields, causing to rotate them. e^(d/dx) is another member of this group. Another member would be the exponentiation of Pauli matrices. Those don't operate on infinite dimensional fields, but rather on 2- component objects. Another member of this group could be 4x4 Lorentz transformations, which operate on 4 vectors. Bottom line : **every field that we quantise must have operators of this group defined on them.**

About SU1xSU2xSU3, I know that these are used as gauge groups. But idk much more than that. 

Have I understood them right? And **is there any connection between what these two groups have to do with physics?** Or are just important but independent ideas?

What's actually happening to the pasta when it dries?

Text: I saw a bunch of studies and assertions that it ruins REM sleep. But I also saw stuff that says it's a miracle for sleep and anxiety and nightmares. These things don't seem to coalesce into one pattern; if it helps with anxiety, then it can't also not let you get real rest, becuase over time you would get worse anxiety from not being able to sleep. Bad sleep=more anxiety. Ditto nightmares, if you can't get real rest, then you get more nightmares. 

So what's going on? Is the data conflicting, does it matter who's being studied and why they're taking the drug, does it matter what particular type of thing they're taking, what ingestion method?

However, as far as I can tell, those risks are not increased in the case of people, female or otherwise, taking testosterone intentionally. (For example, transgender men who use HRT, or bodybuilders who use steroids that increase testosterone.)

Why is that? Does it have something to do with the conditions that naturally cause hyperandrogenism?

I'd just imagine there being some offset that causes gas accumulation eventually causing the glass jar to explode. 

Especially when the animals within, snails and such, piggybacking on the plants I introduce, begin to breed? 

Similarly to when I did sauerkraut that one time and didn't provide a release valve 😅

Text: I've had this question stuck in my brain for a few days. We know that light pollution affects a lot of animals in myriad ways, and that artificial blue lights really screw with our time clocks and sleep, and spending time in green space has both physical and mental health benefits. 

So, if spending time in green space is something we seem to need to thrive, what about the stars themselves? A big percentage of people have never seen the Milky Way at night because it's too bright at night now. I know people who didn't know it was something you could see with the naked eye, and had almost spiritual experiences seeing a proper night sky. Maybe it's a silly question, or maybe impossible to really study separately from the impact of artificial light in general. But I am curious if anyone has looked into whether the lack of stars at night has any effects on our health?

Text: As some who is very eager to get another booster, it feels like things have stalled since the CDC authorized it for adults 50+. Is there a reason for this? My impression was that each shot remains effective for around 6 months. For myself and others I know under 50, we're well past that point.

Text: If I take a big strong spring and compress it between my arms, it takes a continuous amount of energy for me to hold it there.

However if I put that same spring in a vice and use some of my energy to close the vice, it'll happily sit there closed without me needing to add extra energy to the vice.

What's the difference here? Why do I seemingly need an infinite amount of energy to hold the spring closed but the vice doesn't? Where is that energy from me going?

Text: My understanding of math/physics is formally at an undergraduate level, so I apologize in advance if my questions are confusing or not very well formulated.

I've watched some videos about the holographic principle and how it was the attempts to solve the so-called black hole information paradox that lead to the development of string theories and the holographic principle. Ultimately this culminates in the correspondence between Anti-de Sitter spaces (a model of the universe under general relativity) and conformal field theories (i.e., quantum field theories). In the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klpDHn8viX8), the presenter tells us two things: 1.) That this correspondence leads to a &quot;natural&quot; theory of quantum gravity, and 2.) that interactions (between quantum particles?) on the boundary of the mathematical object's surface correspond to the emergence of gravity within the volume. However, he tells us that this isn't applicable to *our* universe, because anti-de Sitter spaces assume a negative curvature on the space-time metric, while as far as I understand, in reality it is zero (i.e., a Minkowski space-time).

So my questions are twofold: what quantum information is the problem here, and in need of conservation; are they things like spins and energies, and why does this lead to the holographic principle? Secondly, what is being said about the actual physics going on between quantum field theories and gravity with regards to this strange mathematical object?

Text: There are multiple arcs of light spreading from many of the galaxies shown in the deep field image from the James Webb Telescope. From googling I'm understanding that these arcs are generally the result of gravitational lensing caused by a mass outside the focus of the image. My specific question stems from the multiple arcs that aren't concentric.

I've worked to the perhaps invalid understanding that each non-concentric arc must represent a different lense (gravitational mass) How is a single perspective (the telescope) able to focus the light from multiple lenses at once?

What I found was [this](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2009/1201/p1254.html#:~:text=Pharmacodynamic%20differences%20in%20women%20include,experience%20an%20adverse%20drug%20reaction) &quot; Pharmacodynamic differences in women include **greater sensitivity to and enhanced effectiveness of beta blockers, opioids, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and typical antipsychotics**. Additionally, women are 50 to 75 percent more likely than men to experience an adverse drug reaction. &quot;

**So my question is, does transitioning with hormones (lets say a Transwoman/ Male to Female) have an effect on how the body reacts to medical treatment?** 

Also other interesting things I would like to know regarding that topic, are there differences in blood values between male and female, and how do transpeople get evaluated with that in mind.

I have found that part of the process of Ca^2+ sensitization that occurs in cavernosal smooth muscle cells is by the action of Src tyrosine kinases acting on BK(Ca) receptors by phosphorylating the alpha subunits.

However, what I don't understand is how exactly that phosphorylation winds up affecting the calcium levels?  Does it activate the ion gate?  Does it hyperpolarize the surrounding membrane?  Are other chemicals like cAMP or DAG involved? I am not a biochemist and I am but a humble physicist.  The publications on the matter seem to overlook this little detail as prerequisite material, so I'm at a bit of a loss.  I see how this works in Na ion channels as well as in vascular smooth muscle cells, but those seem to be operating by a different mechanism.

Text: I just got done watching a video about Parting of the Waters in Moran, WY. There is a unique feature here in which a creek running along the continental divide splits and half runs to the Pacific while the other half runs to the Atlantic. The title of the video is &quot;The Creek that Flows to Two Different Oceans&quot; if anyone wants to check it out for more context.

Anyway, it got me thinking: Assuming no evaporation, absorption into the soil, or any other means of exiting the continuous flow, how long would it take a drop of water to flow from that location all the way to the Atlantic Ocean?

There are overlapping issues like estimating actual path lengths of the creeks and rivers, different flow rates that depend on precipitation and water levels, fluid dynamics, and I'm sure a bunch other stuff I'm not even thinking of. Seems like such a cool multi-disciplinary problem. Is it possible to simplify it enough to get a rough answer? I'd love to hear everyone's take!

Text: The first image from the JWST shows thousands of galaxies. NASA's article says that this image &quot;covers a patch of sky approximately the size of a grain of sand held at arm's length by someone on the ground.&quot;

If there are thousands of (even extremely distant) galaxies at every point in the sky (when viewed from Earth), why is the night sky dark in so many places? It seems like it could be bright almost everywhere -  is it just that some are so much closer &amp; brighter, so it looks that way?

Text: (I didn't get any answers on r/loseit and a mod on r/nutrition recommended to post this here)

I'm not going to quote any sources but correct me if I get anything wrong. I did some googling and reading on Reddit, and heard that when you grow up obese, your body makes more fat cells to store fat and that number gets locked in after adolescence, or they won't be made except under extreme circumstances afterwards. Also that generally childhood obesity makes the body have a tendency / more &quot;biologically wired&quot; to store fat or more fat.

Let's say I have person A and person B. A had childhood obesity while B didn't, and both have the same stats that would be put in a TDEE calculator like [this one](https://www.freedieting.com/calorie-calculator) (sex, age, physical activity, etc.) except for weight, but if they enter in the same weight, both would get the same TDEE Result. If they both ate, let's say 2000 calories a day, would person A weight noticeably more, or they weigh about the same (and any difference would just be the result of being 2 different people)?

Text: Or are elaiosomes considered a type of fruit? And in that case, what defines them? Is it something structural or are they functionally defined by the relationship with ants? I just encountered the word for the first time, and I'm trying to put the information into the proper conceptual slot.

The Wikipedia article is somewhat unclear and could use some revision, or at least more explanation in this regard.
