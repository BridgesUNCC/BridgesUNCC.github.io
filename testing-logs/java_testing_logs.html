Text: I assume that the average temperature of Earth changes based on multiple variables: Distance from the sea/ocean, altitude, hours of daylight, time of day etc. What are the criteria for measuring the average temperature of Earth?

I also assume that each nation gives their own averages, but how do we determine the weights for each country? For example Russia is a lot bigger than Luxembourg, so Russia should have more variation in temperatures and their landmass should represent a larger proportion of the average temperatures.

Text: How can you ensure that the one you want to condition ends up the one being conditioned?

To paint a hypothetical situation for an example, let's consider a child who starts out liking its teddy bear, but because that teddy bear was often present along with another (negative) stimulus, it began fearing or even hating the teddy bear. How can you determine which of the stimuli will be conditioned? 

And can you somehow &quot;force&quot; a particular one of them to be conditioned? Could you perhaps use that teddy bear to condition a negative stimulus (like fear of the dark) into a positive stimulus (eg. an apathy/ambivalence towards the dark, or perhaps even fascination with the dark)?

Text: [Here](https://youtu.be/708q7LjMGso?t=154) is the interview.

He says 

&gt;There’s a great seam, a famous seam-a world famous one-- which I believe is called the Great Atlantic Fault. And it starts in northern Spain in the Basque Country, and it goes under the Bay of Biscay and comes up in south Wales. Then it goes under the Atlantic and comes up in Pennsylvania. So that if you took a Basque miner, or a Welsh miner or Pennsylvanian miner, and you could blindfold them and transport them, and they will recognise the coalface the moment they see it.  I believe it's four feet, six inches.

It's a beautiful interview and it seems believable enough.  But I can't find any references to the &quot;Great Atlantic Fault,&quot; outside of quotes of the interview or from the 2014 movie &quot;Pride&quot; where Bill Nighy's character closely paraphrase's Burton's speech.  Granted Burton says, &quot;I believe it's called the Great Atlantic Fault&quot; so maybe he just got the name wrong.  But is this a real geological feature?

Text: Beekeepers remove the honey from hives and bees must keep working and keep on pollinating flowers.

But I've read in another thread that wild bee hives don't slack, and once the hive is full of honey, they swarm and start a new hive with a new queen somewhere else.

Which of the two methods is better for the ecosystem? I would dare to guess that beekeept hives are better for orchards and fruit trees, as they keep a hive always nearby at full work, while wild hives are better for the wilderness as the colonies are more spread and and reach a larger area?

Also, aren't bees basically almost clones? Don't wild hives promote genetic diversity and are better posed for survival? (if not for a given hive, at least for a number of hives in the area)

Text: It seems as if the [Toba Catastrophe Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toba_catastrophe_theory) is on the way out. From my understanding of the theory itself, a genetic bottleneck that occurred ~75,000 years ago was linked to the Toba VEI-8 eruption. However, evidence showing that societies and cultures away from Southeast Asia continued to develop after the eruption, which has seemed to debunk the Toba Catastrophe Theory.

However, that still doesn't explain the genetic bottleneck found in humans around this time. So, my question is, are there any theories out there that suggest what may have caused this bottleneck? Or has the bottleneck's validity itself been brought into question?

If some planets received a different composition of light waves than ours I suspect it might be possible but I don't know if that is physically accurate. 

I know there are different types of stars and I know that the consensus is that a planet needs to be in the 'goldilocks zone' of a star to support life.

I'm not a native speaker of English, so I wondered if that had perhaps something to do with it - perhaps my mother tongue delimited pink and purple differently than English. But asking some Americans, I found out that actually the jury was split. This got me thinking...  


\- Are some color boundaries fuzzier / more ambiguous than others? For instance, yellow might not be as contentious a color as others, but that is just my impression. 

  
\- If some color boundaries are fuzzier than others, is that consistent across languages? For instance, is the boundary between green and blue always fuzzy?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Are there any biological bases for color definitions, anchored perhaps in color perception and processing?  


I realize that this question straddles many disciplines, so I flaired it with Psychology but it could as well have been linguistic, anthropological etc.

Text: I have a barometer that tells me a number in hPa (right now it says 1007, which is apparently close to normal? But what is the significance of that, of an- I assume- &quot;normal level of atmospheric pressure&quot;?) I can't figure out what the point even is of knowing this information at a given time! 
The only time in which I could see this being useful is if-whether weather conditions occur at corresponding hPa levels--if i could replace temperature, chance of rain, is it sunny or cloudy, etc. with it.. I have no idea what I'm talking about. 

Can anyone just fill me in and explain atmospheric pressure, its significance to life- my life, every day life, anything

Hope this is the right flair, I couldn't find the one for meteorology or something.

Text: Lemons (which I buy from the market) have a high degree of axial symmetry.  Rotate them around their major axis, and they're usually pretty similar from all angles.  Cut one in half along the minor axis, and the segments are each about the same angular size.  The albedo is pretty circular and uniform, too.   


And then, the seeds.   There are usually fewer than one per segment.   And when that's the case, you just have 1 in one segment, another in another, and they jut off in seemingly random angles.   


Why the absence of azimuthal symmetry for seeds?

Text: I was recently thinking about multi grade motor oil and had a hard time understanding viscosity as a function of temperature.  So far as I understand, the idea is that the oil is less viscous when cold so it’ll run through a cold engine faster, ergo 10w30 would be a viscosity of 10 when cold and then 30 when warm.  But logically that makes zero sense to me; wouldn’t hot oil be less viscous?  One example a website gave was a marble being dropped into honey at two different temperatures and as expected the marble through warm honey traveled faster than the marble in cold honey.  So what am I missing here?

While when i am studying mineralogy and crystallography i see that many mineral's higher temperature polymorphs are more ordered than the low temperature. For example Akali feldspars high temperature polymorphs (Sanidine and Orthoclase) are Monoclinic in symmetry and the lower temperature polymorph (microcline) is in Triclinic symmetry.

As far as i understand monoclinic is supposed to be more ordered than triclinic. So what am i misunderstanding here? Why are these two things counter intuitive?

Beyond the characteristic erythema migrans (&quot;bullseye&quot;) rash, symptoms range from arthritis to damaging nervous and cardiac systems. With so many cases every year, it is imperative that everyone learn what steps can be taken to minimize and prevent Lyme disease infections while also getting up to date on the current scientific and medical interventions being used to treat and cure Lyme disease in infected individuals.

Join us today at 2 PM ET (18 UT) for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology, about all aspects of Lyme disease (and other tickborne diseases). We'll take your questions and discuss what people can do to prevent Lyme disease, how Lyme disease is best diagnosed and treated, and what to do if you suspect that you have Lyme disease. Ask us anything!

Is the fundamental limit to how fast a temperature can change based of a plank length, or something else? I suppose it must be linked to fundamental forces and atomic motion, but I can’t really get an intuitive sense of what might limit the speed of temperature change.

Text: I am a medical student and I am currently going through pulmonary physiology. I understand the concepts of diffusion and perfusion-limited gases, but there is one point in my physiology textbook which I cannot seem to understand.

When discussing DLCO, the textbook states that CO is a diffusion-limited gas. It then goes on to discuss the effects of changes in flow (Q) on DLCO and how doubling or halving flow does not impact DLCO, supporting that it is a diffusion not perfusion-limited gas. But I do not get why changing Q would not affect DLCO. Here is my take on it: Arterial CO pressure does not equilibrate with alveolar CO pressure by the end of the pulmonary capillary (i.e., diffusion-limited), but it still does rise slightly to some value lower than that of the alveoli. So wouldn’t increasing flow decrease contact time and thus cause an even lower arterial CO pressure throughout the pulmonary capillary and thus the gradient for CO diffusion would be greater than at lower flow rates? And therefore, a higher DLCO?

In support of my understanding, increased DLCO can be observed in obesity and is attributed to increased pulmonary blood flow in these patients.

Noteworthy to mention, the textbook does assume that pulmonary capillary dimensions are constant with changing flow. But still, I do not believe this would make the above reasoning false.

Thank you in advance!

Within that circle, the gravity increases by an incredible amount and it only increases within that circle. What would happen to the water in that area? would it cause a straight hole to the bottom of the ocean or would a different kind of phenomenon occur?

Text: If you run a current through a wire, you create a magnetic field, and that magnetic field has a direction relative to the flow of the current. So if you were to explain to the aliens with no concept of left and right, you could tell them to set up an experiment where they connect a battery to a wire with the negative pole in a specified direction and the positive pole in the other. 

Then all you need to do is state that when viewing the wire from a perspective relative to the flow of the electrons, you observe the direction of rotation of the magnetic field, and at the &quot;up&quot; position (opposite the direction of gravity) is either right or left depending on the perspective relative to electron flow?

I currently work as a scribe in pediatric cardiomyopathy and see a lot of HCM, and knowing the pathology of ventricular hypertrophy got me wondering if there was a risk on RV or LV hypertrophy in fighter pilots due to chronic exposure due intense +Gs

I read one study from Israeli fighter pilots that found no difference in cardiac dimensions by echocardiography when comparing pilots exposed to +Gs vs. -Gs (compared over a 5 year period). However are there studies that compare cardiac dimensions and functions of pilots to the baseline population not exposed to these type of G forces?

Text: Two reasons actually, first, how do we know they are still entangled from just one end? And does the knowing disrupt the entanglement?

So if we have two entangled particles and we send one out to orbit Jupiter (or anywhere far away) on a spaceship, can the people on the ship know if the particle is still entangled without disrupting the entanglement and without communicating at all with the people holding the other particle on Earth?

What if we had the tech to send sets of 26 entangles particle pairs on the ship, for simple example we send 3 sets of 26 entangled particles, and designate each pair in each 26 set a letter of the alphabet, then the people on earth interrupted the pair, in the first set of 26, with the designation of the letter Y causing it to disentangle so the people on the ship would know that we disentangled the letter Y pair. Then the second set the people on Earth caused the pair designated letter E to disentangle, and then the third set they disentangle the pair designated letter S, have we not just communicated FTL?

I'm a stupid monkey so just tell me why.

I was wondering if there is any sort of physical trauma that could result in bicephaly, such as an egg being dropped or slightly damaged? If so, would it be possible for scientists to make a notch in a developing embryo and encourage bicephaly? I know it's kind of morbid, but I was really curious as to whether or not physical environmental factors have an impact on this since I couldn't find many sources surrounding it!

Text: I have a scientific background mainly in math and computer science and some parts of evolution make sense to me like birds evolving better suited beaks or viruses evolving to spread faster. These things evolve in small changes each of which has a benefit.

But a circulation system needs a number of different parts to work, you need a heart at least 1 lung, blood vessels and blood to carry the oxygen around. Each of these very complex and has multicellular structure (except blood).

I see how having a circulation system gives an organism an advantage but not how we got here.

The only explanation I have found on the Internet is that we can see genetic similarities between us and organisms without a circulation system but that feels very weak evidence.

To my computer science brain evolution feels like making a series of small tweaks to a computer program, changing a variable or adding a line of code. Adding a circulation system feels a lot more than a tweak and would be the equivalent of adding a new features that required multiple changes across many files and probably the introduction whole new components and those changes need to be done to work together to achieve the overall goal.

Many thx

EDIT Thanks for all the responses so far, I have only had time to skim through them so far. In particular thanks to those that have given possible evolutionary paths to evolve form a simple organism to a human with a complex circulation system.

We're aware of the risks and big events that are possible with solar cycle maximums, but since a lot of news stories sound like they're trying to convince us that the sun is about to kill us all, we're looking for something a little bit more nuanced to give us some perspective. My friend is interested in astronomy but *also has astrophobia* so has been looking for something a little more reassuring than articles constantly popping up on his social media recommendations that exaggerate for clicks.

What should we actually expect, and what should we look for in news articles to tell us what we actually need to know?

Text: I had heard that lemon juice makes your body alkaline, which made no sense to me, so I did some googling. I found that it was not true, as I anticipated (since your body regulates your blood's pH level), but what I couldn't find a solid conclusion for in either direction was whether or not lemon juice creates alkaline byproducts in digestion. 

I found many semi-reputable sources (https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/lemon-juice-acidic-or-alkaline for example) that seemed to agree with that, and say that while it doesn't affect your body or blood's pH level, it can make your urine more alkaline. Most of the people I'd seen refuting it where simply saying that lemon juice can't turn your body alkaline and that it's pseudoscience hogwash, rather than specifically talking to the point that it does or doesn't make alkaline byproducts during digestion.

So my question is: Does lemon juice produce alkaline byproducts during digestion and make your urine more alkaline, and if it does, what's the process that occurs to make this happen and what is happening to all the acid? Where are the extra Hydrogen ions going?

EDIT: Thanks for all the replies! Got some really good ones that answered my question with academic sources! Just wanted to note that as I mentioned, I know that your body regulates pH and that trying to turn your body or urine &quot;more alkaline&quot; doesn't have any health benefits, was just curious on this specific point of urine/alkaline byproducts because I couldn't find an explanation but saw relatively reputable sources suggest it's true.

Still, always good to include that as part of the explanation for others who may not know that it gives no health benefits.

Text: I thought that was exclusive to mammals and maybe birds, that the [Ancient Reptilian Brains](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Triune_brain) literally had not developed the “layers” responsible for what we'd call “emotions” (allegedly, the [Limbic System](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/lymbic%20system)?). Yet, I'm finding out many anecdotal examples of reptiles being loyal or physically affectionate. I'm very confused by this.

EDIT: a poster has brought up that we may be confusing “affection,” which only mammals can do, with “imprinting,” which “simpler” brains can manage. What are the differences between the two, in practice? Can one design tests to distinguish one process from the other, on a behavioral, empirical, tangible, objective level?

Text: Looking at [the Wikipedia page for absorption bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_band), it seems to me that there's a sizable window - i.e. a [local minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima) \- in the graph for [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation) absorption, as per [this image](https://i.stack.imgur.com/jOhUm.png).

[Water vapor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor), [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen), [ozone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone), and [methane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane) appear to be entirely transparent to radiation of 4 μm wavelength, [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) only appears to start absorbing it *after* that point, and even [nitrous oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide) has a window there. Moreover, [Rayleigh scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering) is also minimal there.

On top of *that*, [this Earth Science Stack Exchange answer](https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/13620/does-anyone-have-absorption-coefficients-at-different-wavelengths-for-sulfur-dio/13621#13621) and [its source](https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/13620/does-anyone-have-absorption-coefficients-at-different-wavelengths-for-sulfur-dio/13621#13621) show minimal (sub-0.5%) absorbance of [sulfur dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide) at that wavelength. Why is this? It seems like a rather odd coincidence for so many things to be transparent to 4 μm (a specific wavelength of mid-wavelength infrared) EM radiation.

As a coincidence, this is one of many parts why global warming is a thing, IIRC: mid-range infrared comes in through the 4 μm gap, gets soaked up by the Earth, and later gets re-radiated at different wavelengths that *do* get soaked up by the atmosphere.

I just don't know *why* there's a 4 μm gap there.

Text: As a Yemeni-American, I've noticed trends in how other first-gens from (loosely) similar regions and genetic backgrounds show greater susceptibility to certain diseases. 

I understand that we know, for example, that certain populations don't react well to alcohol on a genetic level, and have a greater propensity for addiction. Then, after enough generations of that, that population's gene pool has a greater physical tolerance or resistance to some of the negative effects of alcoholism. Yemen is an interesting case because many parts of it are inhabited by people who've resided there for such a long time and with so little mixing, relative to many other places.

Then of course there are the stark differences in lifestyles, and certain morphological or physiological advantages or disadvantages can become the opposite.

Do we understand more than this? I've read that genetics will require a quantum leap before we can more accurately analyze and predict disease susceptibility based on genetic markers, so I guess I'm just trying to get a read on how well we *actually* understand these topics, or even how we come to the conclusions we *can* draw.

Arguments for yes: we (humans) are very invasive, and pesticides are powerful.

Arguments for no: the houses' area are insignificant compared to the wooded/grassy area. More over, we are creating a nutrition-rich environment for these insects and that's why they are around us. So we are killing as many as we produce.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;***This is the first time that detection of MPXV (DNA and virus by isolation) in environmental air samples from healthcare settings has been reported,.***  
&gt;  
&gt;***Detection of MPXV DNA in air samples collected at distances of greater than 1•5m from the patient and at a height of nearly 2m supports the theory that MPXV can be present in either aerosols, suspended skin particles or dust containing virus, and not only in large respiratory droplets that fall to the ground within 1 to 1-5m of an infected individual.***  
&gt;  
&gt;***Five out of fifteen air samples taken were positive. Significantly, three of four air samples collected during a bed linen change in one patient's room were positive (Ct 32-7-35-8). Interpretation: These data demonstrate significant contamination in isolation facilities and potential for aerosolisation of MPXV during specific activities.***  
&gt;  
&gt;***We identified widespread MPXV DNA contamination of the environment in respiratory isolation rooms occupied by infected symptomatic individuals.***

&amp;#x200B;

Trying to parse the implications of this study. 2m (6.5 feet) above the patient sounds like it's airborne right?

Maybe we shouldn't be sending potentially contagious patients to STI clinics like we currently are?

There was pretty much no treatment at the time, and I know that even in today there aren't many options to treat radiation sickness from like an attack, but would there be anything that could be done for cases like these? They lived in horrific pain for years after they more or less knew what was going on, making multiple women understandably suicidal.

Text: The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease says that the accumulation of the peptide amyloid-β in the brain is the main cause of the disease. However, after decades of research and clinical trials there has been little to no success in treating Alzheimer's patients based on this hypothesis, and it has been questioned, see for example:

&gt;[The amyloid hypothesis on trial. As the development of treatments for Alzheimer’s disease continues to stumble, is it time for researchers to broaden their list of the condition’s potential causes?
](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05719-4)

It was recently reported that some western blot images which claim to show a sub-type of amyloid beta, Aβ\*56, may have been manipulated. The report was the result of an investigation by *Science*:

&gt;[Blots on a field? A neuroscience image sleuth finds signs of fabrication in scores of Alzheimer’s articles, threatening a reigning theory of the disease](https://www.science.org/content/article/potential-fabrication-research-images-threatens-key-theory-alzheimers-disease)

Such manipulations the report claims go back to the original 2006 paper describing Aβ\*56 in *Nature*  written by Sylvain Lesné and Karen Ashe:

&gt;[A specific amyloid-β protein assembly in the brain impairs memory](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04533)

From the report in *Science* one may get the impression that the vast majority of Aβ plaque-related research and drug development since then has been focused on the Aβ\*56 subtype, in which case the alleged fraud would be an enormous setback to the field, with billions of dollars and decades of research time wasted. However, there are many types of Aβ and I'm unclear on just how important Aβ\*56 is to the field of Alzheimer's research and drug development. My initial thought was that there's no way all this time, effort, and money has been invested in something that only one lab has published (even if they've published on it many times) and no independent researchers have validated. The *Science* report says that some others have detected Aβ\*56 but I don't know in what context, or if this other work validates the work from Lesné and Ashe:

&gt;In the 16 years following the landmark paper, Lesné and Ashe—separately or jointly—published many articles on their stellar oligomer. Yet only a handful of other groups have reported detecting Aβ\*56.

An article on Alzforum has comments from some of the scientists involved in the controversy:

&gt;[Sylvain Lesné, Who Found Aβ*56, Accused of Image Manipulation](https://www.alzforum.org/news/community-news/sylvain-lesne-who-found-av56-accused-image-manipulation)

In particular, the top comment which is from Karen Ashe, the senior author on the original 2006 paper:

&gt;...it is clear that there are two general forms of Aβ, type 1 and type 2. One particular form of type 1 (referred to in our papers as Aβ\*56 and in the Science article as “toxic oligomers”) was shown by my lab and others to impair memory function in mice. The type 2 form of Aβ is the one found in amyloid plaques. It is this latter form that drug developers have repeatedly but unsuccessfully targeted. There have been no clinical trials targeting the type 1 form of Aβ...

Scientific misconduct or fraud is of course terrible, and if true I'm sure this has set back at least some progress in the field. But just how significant is this fraud if it's true?

1st number is 0.1, 17th number is 0.71, 8241st number is 0.1428, 9218754th number is 0.4578129.

I think the size of both sets are the same? For Cantor's diagonal argument, if you match up every integer with a real number (btw is it even possible to do so since the size is infinite) and create a new real number by changing a digit from each real number, can't you do the same thing with integers?  


Edit: For irrational numbers or real numbers with infinite digits (ex. 1/3), can't we reverse their digits over the decimal point and get the same number? Like &quot;0.333...&quot; would correspond to &quot;...333&quot;?

So back when the space program was just starting, what was the technology they used to talk to people in space. Was it a series of broadcasting antennas around the globe? Something that has a strong enough broadcast range to pass through planetary bodies? Some kind of aimed technology like a satellite dish that could track the ship in orbit?

As of mid-June, there were over 2100 reported cases of monkeypox in dozens of countries. While a great deal is already known about the science of the monkeypox virus, this outbreak has raised several new questions about its transmissibility and impact on human health in both the short and long terms. With the world's attention heightened to such disease outbreaks due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this seems like a good opportunity to provide answers and help alleviate concerns.

We are experts in infectious diseases who are here to provide the facts about monkeypox and counter the mis-information that has been spreading about this disease. Join us today at 2 PM ET (18 UT) for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology, about the monkeypox outbreak. We'll answer your questions about the symptoms of monkeypox and how it spreads, current strategies for treatment and prevention, and what can be done to contain this (and future) outbreaks. Ask us anything!

I noticed it was mentioned that it mentioned shortly after, regarding the opposite scenario (COVID vaccine then JYNNEOS) that &quot;no minimum interval between mRNA COVID-19 vaccination and orthopoxvirus vaccination is necessary.&quot;

​The main question I have is, what mechanisms could be at play here that potentially increase the risk of myocarditis when receiving JYNNEOS then COVID vaccine, but NOT COVID vaccine then JYNNEOS?

Edit: If anyone was interested in the answer, I asked the person who wrote that article at the CDC and this is what they responded:

&gt;Thank you for your inquiry. There are no specific data on close administration of COVID-19 vaccines and Jynneos vaccines. The reason for consideration of a 4-week interval between the Jynneos first and mRNA second is because of the observed risk of myocarditis with mRNA vaccines and unknown risk of myocarditis with Jynneos. The reason there is no minimum interval when it is mRNA first and Jynneos second is because the benefits of Jynneos for prophylaxis given as soon as possible in the setting of an outbreak, outweighs the theoretical risk of myocarditis when administering them close together. Please continue to follow up with your local health care providers should you have additional questions or concerns. Thank you.

Text: I've read from several different sources that when a fresh injection of basaltic magma intrudes into a more silica-rich magma chamber under a volcano, some sort of reaction happens that ultimately leads to a large explosive eruption. I've specifically heard this implicated for the 19th century Krakatoa eruption, where people point to volcanic rock of varying color bands indicating partially mixed magmas that cooled preserving the different rock types. 

However, these sources don't mention a mechanism for this. Is there some sort of chemical reaction between the different magmas? Is it a physical reaction relating to different temperature/density/viscosity/gas content/something else?

What leads two bodies of relatively stable magma to generate immense pressure and explode when mixed together?

Then, later, the same squirrels started attacking one another! One seemingly nearly killed the other one - By the end of the fight it was hanging off of a tree branch, mouth open, clearly exhausted. It wasn't even holding onto the branch. Is this normal behavior for squirrels? What's the science behind this behavior? I've never seen it before!

Text: [The Highly Controversial Plan To Stop Climate Change](https://youtu.be/i4Hnv_ZJSQY)

I am not an environmental scientist, a climate scientist, nor a resource scientist, but I do have a fairly robust understanding of our current predicament in regards to climate change. The video I’ve linked presents Russ George, who claims that based upon his research, a planet wide bloom of phytoplankton could absorb a significant percentage of the world’s carbon. I have several questions about this.

Based on what I’ve seen, his message is backed by research. However, I’m unaware whether or not it is peer reviewed, or even seriously considered by others within his field. If it were to be true, then I would imagine climate scientists would be talking about this nonstop, but I’ve only just heard about it. I can’t tell, and any clarity on whether or not his work and claims are credible would be helpful.

If it is credible, then I have several further questions. What would be the ecological ramifications of having a phytoplankton bloom on a global scale? Beyond that, how much time would it buy humanity to switch over to carbon neutral methods of energy production?

Thank you in advance for any insight into this issue.

Text: Summary: Large solid chunk of steel submerged in a solution of copper(ii) sulfate and tin(ii) sulfate (estimated ration of 10-1). Left to sit for 24 hours. Reaction expected to produce precipitates of metallic copper and tin and a solution of iron(ii) sulfate.

Question: Would the copper and tin precipitate out as a metallic alloy, or would they come out as separate layers, crystals, etc.. ?

So... I've been messing around with copper(ii) sulfate for the past few days. One of my ongoing experiments started with putting scrap electronics solder in a solution of the stuff. My idea was the tin and lead would replace the copper and leave a solution of pure tin(ii) sulfate and insoluble lead(ii) sulfate and copper metal. The results were promising as I was left with a beautiful turquoise blue solution along with white precipitate of lead(ii) sulfate and copper collecting on the old solder. My only mistake was that I did not have enough solder, and so the resulting solution was still mostly copper(ii) sulfate.

It was this mixture of tin(ii) sulfate and copper(ii) sulfate that I added a slightly rusted steel hammer head to. I honestly didn't have a plan at this point other then a quick google search to see where iron was in terms of reactivity. Success on that: I now have an almost pure solution of iron(ii) sulfate. I will likely continue using sulfate to juggle metal ions with reckless abandon.

It's the hammer head I sacrificed that I'm really curios about. It's completely covered in copper crystals and I'm pretty certain the tin is mixed in as well. I'll link a picture in the comments. I really want to know if I just accidentally made a copper-tin alloy.

Text: Hello everyone hope you have a great day. So I just began studying the immune system and I have some questions. 
So if I understand it correctly so far, when pathogens enter the body they have to get recognized somehow, so the body can destroy them. So pathogens have these pamp (pathogen associated molecular patterns) that get recognized by the phagocytes with the help of &quot;toll like receptors&quot;. Also my textbook says something about opsonins, chemical compounds that &quot; mark&quot; the pathogens so phagocytes can recognize and destroy them. 

My questions are:
1) How did the cell evolve those toll receptors? Was it randomly but they stayed bc they are useful? Let's say you have a cell that no pathogen has ever interacted with it. So logically, the cell hasn't any receptor for it (or it has but it was a random generation-im not sure how it works). 
2) From my understanding, opsonins bind to the pathogen somehow and help the phagocyte recognize it. So opsonins have a lock-key relationship with phagocytes? It would make sense for the cell to recognize molecules that are part of the cell. But how do opsonins bind to the pathogens? My textbook isn't going on detail. 

Thank you for reading so far and sorry if my questions are stupid. Also sorry for any grammar or spelling mistakes, English isn't my first language.

This seems off to me, as this is close to the average density of the intergalactic medium of one atom per cubic meter, which is much less than the interstellar medium average density of one atom per cubic centimeter, which is much less than the average density of a planetary nebular (100-10,000 atoms per cubic centimeter). But I can't find any information on the web to help me understand this better.

Text: This question is specifically aimed at showing how asking high quantities of a population to take the vaccine stops the spread at a population level.

I would assume the following things to be relevant

1. chance of people who get infected that are vaccinated
2. chance of then infecting others, modulated by length of illness, viral load and symptoms (coughing)
3. how good the immunity is from infection + vaccine, i.e. how often vaccinated people get reinfected vs unvaccinated

Im asking this because its pretty frustrating that people always pull a specific country with high vaccination rates and high cases and then say young people getting the vaccine doesnt help others at all. I have the suspicion that their view is limited, but I would like to see evidence or more professional perspectives on the matter :)

Text: In this case, I am concerned only about charge rate, not data transfer rates; but I understand just enough to grasp that this also depends on USB standard level.

[ELI70:] So, consider the case where there are -four- pieces in the chain: Host, &quot;adapter&quot;, cable, device.  Example: in my (old) car, I have a little adapter that plugs into the cig lighter socket; the cable plugs into that; and my phone then charges.  (Until recently, I naïvely thought it was nothing more than a voltage converter.)

* Does EVERY piece need to be at the same level of USB standard in order to get the higher charge rate?  IOW, if the little 12V adapter is 10+ years old, it's probably USB 1.0 and can't possibly deliver 100W even if the cable and device would like it, right?
 * (If that's the case, how does one address this issue?)
* What about these household [combination wall outlets](https://www.acehardware.com/departments/lighting-and-electrical/switches-outlets-and-plugs/outlets/3496551) : What USB version / charge rate will I likely get -- even WITH a USB-C cable?

Why do we not cough in our sleep? Does coughing require consciousness? Or is it something else, maybe it could be related to our breathing patterns? Like when you try taking deep breaths to stop wheezing but cough bad while you exhale? Idk, I don't have anything near a biology background. 
Thank you in advance!

Text: For example, 1 2 3 4 5 6 exhibits a pattern. Each element is the previous plus one. 

But what if say, you know beforehand, the elements of a sequence are between 1 - 6 like in a dice. You’re trying to figure out if a certain sampling method is random. Say you get 3 2 1 2 2 1 3 1 2 2 1 3 2 1 1 2 3 1. The sequence itself doesn’t seem to exhibit a pattern yet they all share the same property of being within the set {1,2,3} and excluding the set {4,5,6}

Randomness is often defined as the lack of a pattern. This sequence by the face of it doesn’t seem to have a pattern yet we know it’s not coming from a uniform random distribution from 1-6 given 4 5 and 6 aren’t selected. How do you explain this?

In present day this area is rather dry, except the areas in Turkey and the river banks in Iran, Iraq and Egypt.

What are the estimates what kind of climate there was in those areas 10 000 years ago? They were probably much more fertile due to lower temperature. I would also guess that a large ice cap in Norhern Europe would have lowered the temperature even more, and also affected on the precipitation in the area.

Text: I am currently reading [The Selfish Gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene), and during one chapter he lightly touched on crossover during meiosis. I started thinking about crossover and I have a lot of questions that I can't really find the answer to. It seems like most places just touch on crossover as a step during meiosis, but don't really elaborate much. Anyway, here are my questions I hope someone can help me wrap my head around this:

* First of all: does crossover only happen (at most) once per chromosome? All diagrams look somewhat like [this](https://ib.bioninja.com.au/_Media/crossing-over_med.jpeg), which indicate that they swap only the ends. Is that the case, or are those diagrams an oversimplification and more than one &quot;pieces&quot; that are crossed over?

* If the answer to the above is yes, then I want to move onto this [meiosis diagram](https://cdn.lecturio.com/assets/Overview-of-meiosis-I-and-II-1200x1034.png). Is it true to assume then that we all likely possess entire chromosomes that came directly from our grandparents? In the diagram, each of the 4 cells has 2 chromosomes, one that's intact, and one that's crossed over. So for example, if my dad passed an &quot;intact&quot; chromosome 1 to me, there's a 1/4 chance that I'll pass that intact chromosome 1 to my son. Is that correct?

* How does crossing over work with the sex chromosomes? In the case of eggs, there's always two Xs, do those crossover? In the case of sperm, there's one X and one Y, do those crossover in anyway, or are they left alone?

* If the answer to question 1 is yes, then is there a pre-determined (approximate or accurate) length that's exchanged? If so, how is it determined? If it's random, what determines it? 

* Is the number of base pairs in an exchange the same on each side? Also, this question and the above assume it's done by number of base pairs. Is it &quot;calculated&quot; differently perhaps? Number of genes? Something else?

* Now, the question in the title: how does the process ensure that no really bad errors are introduced? If I understand correctly, it's not necessary that the two homologous chromosomes are the same length. One may have mutations the other doesn't, and vice versa. It's also likely those mutations are fine independently. But when mixed together, they could break things... so why doesn't it?

* And lastly: if question 1 is yes, has the existence of the crossover process lead to &quot;less important&quot; (or &quot;more ok to mutate) genes to be at the tips, and &quot;more important&quot; genes to be towards the middle? For example, per the question above, I imagine that eye color genes or genes that contribute to my face shape or skin color or traits like that are more &quot;ok&quot; to be mutated, where as for example, the gene for hemoglobin... you don't want to mess with that one.


Thanks for looking at my wall of text. I'm happy to restate questions if they don't make sense. Hope someone or many of you can help me with this.

Thanks again!

Text: Is there some kind of concept of evolutionary permanence that I can read about?

Like, of course there's DNA: no creature will ever evolve on Earth that is not based in DNA. Right? And probably something similar, if weaker, applies to all the various crazy proteins and other stuff that makes a cell work. Like, look at how conserved photopigments are across the animal kingdom (even beyond, you can find photopigments in non-animals that might be evolutionarily related to the opsins in human and fly retinas, etc etc).

Then you can get up to bigger scales, to things like cell types. Like, will there ever be a descendant of animals that has no neurons? It seems like, since neurons first evolved, they are *stuck*. I read a paper a while back on similarities between invertebrate and vertebrate neurons, and was amazed. They even use more-or-less the same neurotransmitters (if in different roles).

Then bigger: since insects invented wings, virtually none of them have lost them (ants, sort of - and a few other very weird examples). And insects always have that exoskeleton and always will - no insect will ever evolve with an endoskeleton, right?

And how tetrapods all have this 1-arm-bone then 2-arm-bone then lots-of-bones plan for their arms and legs (since they all started as fins-on-pegs). It seems like that just will never go away (though you might lose your arms and legs, like a snake, if you have them they always follow that plan).

What do we call this phenomenon?

There, the presence of two bands (test + control), no matter how faint, means that the sample is **negative** for the drug tested. On the other hand, the absence of a band in the test area means the sample is **positive**. 

This is of course the 'opposite' of how COVID-antigen tests work. Moreover, if the test is detecting the drug (or a secondary metabolite) through immunocolorimetry, the way these tests work make little sense.

Text: The way I see it, carbon monoxide is the result of a chemical reaction, the one involved in gas stoves, to my understanding, is oxigen + fuel --&gt; products. Among these products, carbon monoxide.

I was told recently that if your flame burns blue, it doesn't produce carbon monoxide (or not nearly as much as yellow). I don't see how that would work. The color of a flame (in a commercial gas combustion) is dependent on its temperature, I can imagine maybe, if your flame's yellow it partially burns the gas supplied, leading to more gas in the air, but certainly not carbon monoxide, no?

Thanks in advance

Text: I have heard that in the late universe (Degenerate Era I believe, but unsure if the technical stellar formation puts it before this) a small number of stars will likely form through stellar collision. I've heard of direct mechanisms for this that are below the Chandrasekhar Limit using carbon or hydrogen black dwarfs and brown dwarfs and some using neutron star collisions releasing &quot;degenerate gas&quot; (I assume this is a form of degenerate matter?). My questions are, How common are these interactions expected to be? Is it likely to happen anywhere in the universe multiple times in sequence? And What are these stars expected to be like?

But hypothetically, if a climate was hot enough - but was still wet/humid/receiving large quantities of rainfall, could you get a &quot;desert&quot; (as in, dead/lifeless) that is still quite wet - but can't support life because of the extreme heat?

In other words, **how hot does it have to get** before plant/animal life can no longer survive **even** in the presence of large quantities of water?

Asteroids are rocky, airless remnants left over from the early formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago and NASA and our partners are always looking to the skies to study these ancient time capsules. From our missions [to explore the Trojan asteroids in Jupiter's orbit](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/lucy/in-depth/) and [bring a piece of an asteroid back to Earth](https://www.nasa.gov/osiris-rex), to our [efforts to find, track and monitor asteroids](https://www.nasa.gov/specials/pdco/index.html) and other near-Earth objects to protect our planet from potential impact hazards, we're uncovering the history of our solar system while working to keep our future safe.

Ask our experts anything about what we're learning from asteroids, how we're protecting the Earth, and much more!

Desde nuestras misiones para explorar los asteroides troyanos en la órbita de Júpiter y traer un trozo de asteroide de vuelta a la Tierra, hasta nuestros esfuerzos para encontrar, rastrear y monitorear asteroides y otros objetos cercanos a la Tierra para proteger nuestro planeta de posibles peligros de impacto, estamos descubriendo la historia de nuestro sistema solar mientras trabajamos para mantener nuestro futuro seguro.

Pregunta a nuestros expertos cualquier cosa que quieras saber sobre lo que estamos aprendiendo de los asteroides, cómo estamos protegiendo a la Tierra y mucho más.

But I was wondering if the coding strand can only be that, or if it is also used as a template strand every once in a while. Do the two strands switch roles? It seems like a simple question, but I can't seem to get a clear answer through google.

While I  understand that HIV can be present in vaginal fluids, and perhaps the  main contributor of this may be the Bartholin glands, I have not found  any information on the presence of HIV in Skene's glands. Is HIV absent  in this fluid? If so, is that due to certain factors within the fluid  that make the virus unstable as with the case of saliva?

&amp;#x200B;

I have been learning about Piaget recently through the Introduction to Psychology Yale course ([https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6A08EB4EEFF3E91F](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6A08EB4EEFF3E91F)) and I was wondering if it would be possible, maybe through a set of tailored puzzles, to accelerate a child's advancement through Piaget's developmental stages.

 

\- Is there a physical limit for this (possibly that children gain these abilities not only through assimilation with their environment but also the physical growth of brain, therefore such puzzles/toys would not be effective as the child does not have the physical brain capacity to advance in their developmental stage yet?)

&amp;#x200B;

Any studies/videos regarding this topic would be greatly appreciated, let me know what you all think.

In the example of zinc and copper in an aqueous solution, it’s obvious why copper oxidizes zinc: they’re in physical contact. However in a galvanic cell they are separated by considerable distance. 

How is it that the cathode just *knows* the anode is there and current starts flowing when there’s no direct interaction between the oxidant and reductant?

Text: I feel that this is a silly question and I’m probably wrong but I was seeing a post of the scale of the dot where the JWST pointed at and people were surprised there were so many galaxies in that spot. But..there aren’t right? There were that many galaxies that close together 13 billion years ago, not now.

If what we’re doing is looking into the early universe, and the universe has been expanding since the Big Bang, then aren’t we just seeing those first galaxies as they were closer together than they would be today? 

And if what we’re seeing is the very beginning of the universe then wouldn’t pointing the telescope anywhere else for a long enough time reveal a similar picture? In fact, wouldn’t we technically be seeing even the same early galaxies no matter where you point it at?

Text: *Observations:

Every time I trim my body hair, it grows back.

Now there can be two possible explanations for this:

*Explanation 1:

Body hair growth is continuous and hair grows indefinitely long if left ungroomed.

But I know this is not true, because for the first 18 years of my ife I never trimmed any hair, but they still didn't grow further after reaching a certain size.

*Explation 2:

There is some sort of feedback mechanism that let's the hair root cells know that the hair has been trimmed and they grow enough to compensate for the exact length that has been lost.

*Question:

But if hair is made of dead cells, how exactly can the body tell if that particular strand of hair has been cut

(I tried cutting out a patch of hair for this purpose and it grew to the same length as well after a few weeks)

And the exact length to which it has been cut?

....

I specifically put body hair in my question because I've never tested our the full limit of head hair, so I assumed it grows indefinitely.

Text: I just watched the new Jurassic World movie and while I understand it wasn't scientifically accurate, it made me wonder if dinosaurs actually lived in current times and reproduced, how fast would it take them?

Generally, most things on Earth have lifespans seemingly corresponding to their size.  Some flies live for days while larger animals live for years.  Of course there are exceptions, but its kind of a general rule.  Do scientists know, or can estimate, how long would, for example, a T-Rex take from egg to hatching, and from hatchling to natural end of life?  Are we talking a few decades, a hundred years, more than a hundred?  Something like the Brachiosaurus must take many decades to reach full maturity right?  If someone told me it took them 200 years to grow to that size I would not question it.

Text: I've read that Monkey Pox isn't an STD. So why is MSM, allegedly, the most afflicted group according to the WHO?

Edit: Unfortunately, I feel that the answers aren't clear enough and I still have doubts.

I understand that Monkeypox isn't strictly an STD, and it's mainly transmitted by skin-to-skin contact and respiratory secretions during prolonged face-to-face contact. So, I still don't understand why are the media and health organizations focusing specifically on the MSM demographic.

Even if the spread, allegedly, began in some sort of gay event, any person, regardless of sexual orientation,  could eventually get infected with Monkeypox. It's not as if MSM only had contact with other MSM. They might also spread the disease to their heterosexual friends, coworkers, acquaintances, and relatives.

In the worst-case scenario in which we aren't able to contain Monkeypox, LGBT people who don't even participate in random sexual encounters or social gatherings might get infected by heterosexual carriers.

Shouldn't the narrative be changed to &quot;people who partake in hook-up culture and large social events&quot;? What does sexual orientation have to do with the spread of the disease?

Edit2: I'm reading an alarming number of baseless assumptions and stereotypes about MSM or gay men in general, I honestly thought this subreddit was much better.

2. If temperature measures average kinetic energy, couldn’t it just be expressed in terms of joules?

3. Is there a strict linear relationship between energy input and change in temperature? If not, why?

4. Does particle mass affect specific heat? If not why do particles have different specific heats?

5. What is the relationship between specific heat and specific entropy? Why do they have the same units?

6. If joules and kelvin both measure energy, then is entropy dimensionless?

Does that means Schrodinger's Thief isn't really in all 5 houses at once, right? Is the cat just a thought experiment to show absurd consequences of Copenhagen? 

Is observing/applying energy the same problem with a hypothetical graviton? Like if we abstract out a graviton, we can't measure it without adding to energy to it, which adds to the mass, which adds to the gravity, etc etc etc?

On the other hand in the industry, the GaAs oxidation layer is etched off with acid, when GaAs wafers are used - why is this done, and not just water used, if the oxides are water soluble? And how can I imagine the oxide layer itself, is it something that is firmly &quot;bonded&quot; to the GaAs or Si underneath, or is it something more &quot;volatile&quot; that is easily removed? As in: is it really part of the surface, or just &quot;lying on top of it&quot;?

Text: I understand that exposing a larger chunk of a hemisphere to the sun has an incredible effect on the amount of the sun's energy which is able to impact the planet, I have to assume that the elliptical nature of our orbit has some effect as well. Is it at least calculable?

Naturally the reason I'm asking is because the Earth reached aphelion today, meaning we are at the furthest point from the Sun in this orbit, meanwhile we are also very close to the first day of summer, when our tilt puts the northern hemisphere in full view of the Sun.

Text: I think this is for paleontologists? I'm not too sure honestly. 
I don't really have grasp on the process.
Is it just trying something over and over until it slowly appears. 
Or is the DNA somehow incentivised to do something for better or threatened procreation? 
Could someone provide me the proper key points?

As we know, bacteria have begun to 'learn' how to overcome these antibiotics and we now have some types of infectious bacterial diseases that are immune to virtually all known antibiotics.

Would these 'super bacteria' also be dangerous to fungi, including molds and mushrooms? If so, what would that mean for the ecosystem and humans?

But I could find any answer (that I fully understood) as to why this happened.

I'm curious however if plants absorb pesticides directly into their flesh?

For example avocado... can you spray avocados with pesticides all you want and it will be safe to eat because you are removing the thick external cover? Or will the pesticide leach into the water, and then be absorbed by the plant, then eaten by you?

Or does it perhaps get absorbed directly through the skin?

Just curious!

My general takeaway from the thread is that these videos are close enough to &quot;reality&quot; to be presented to a student as such, with some small disclaimers that do not necessarily detract from the animations' accuracy.

Did it eventually slope down to ground/sea level at its edges? Or could you walk on dry ground next to it with open air on one side and a mile high wall of ice on the other? 

What happened when it encountered mountains? Did the ice move like glaciers or did the sheet just add and lose ice at the edges? 

How did weather work over the ice sheet if for thousands of miles in any direction, the “ground” was a over 5,000 feet higher than the rest of the continent and surrounding oceans? Did clouds run into it and get stuck? Did they exist over it?

Text: How does our immune system transfer genetic information about identified viruses and bacteria to future generations of white blood cells and other immune system functions? Does it get transferred, and if so, how can we develop a persistent immunity to something like polio?

How are white blood cells recycled by the body? Does the genetic data coded by these WBCs get lost? 

It is my understanding that WBCs encode some of the genetic material it breaks down to help identify future threats, but WBCs don't live forever, so what happens to this captured genetic material?

Text: The technology/strategy behind mRNA vaccines is truly remarkable, but many explanations I've read seem to skip over a crucial logical step that is the basis of my question.

Once the mRNA enters a cell and the cell begins producing the protein that the mRNA encodes for, what are the processes between this stage and the stage of the immune system interacting with it? The state of affairs at this stage is a foreign protein inside the cell and it needs to end up in the &quot;hands off the immune system&quot;. If the protein in question is say the so-called &quot;spike protein&quot; of COVID-19, how does it get outside of the cell or to the surface of the cell? 

Cells are complicated^citation ^needed and usually have many interconnected parts like proteins helping other proteins get where they need to go or to fold in a particular way. Does the inherent shape/structure of the spike protein in this case make it thermodynamically favorable to embed itself in the cell's membrane and express itself outward? Proteins don't generally just leak out of cells so my current best guess is that it's presented by the cell in some way. Assuming this is the case, does that immune system now recognize that cell as foreign and destroy it (and thus 'read' the spike protein)?

Thanks for anyone's time.

Once released into the host cell, however, they have no issues finding and then binding to each other. Why is that?

Text: Let's assume that, for some reason, a cell is using [active transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_transport) to move water out of itself or an organelle within itself - why, I don't know, but it is, perhaps it's trying to pull the water out of an [aqueous solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution) within itself, or perhaps trying to self-desiccate.

How much ATP would the cellular pump in question consume per water molecule it transports this way? Does it depend on the concentration of water on either side of the pump? Is there a correlation between the atomic mass of a molecule in [daltons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton_(unit)) and the amount of ATP required to force it through a pump?

Text: According to an air pressure calculator I found on Google, the air at 2 km above MSL would be about 0.8 atm and at 2.5 km above MSL it would be about 0.75 atm.

As per my understanding, getting 20-25% less oxygen per breath would mean that a high-altitude athlete's body would have more RBCs, bigger lungs, and a bigger heart, and that should give a noticeable advantage to the high altitude athlete.

But from personal experience (as someone who is rather unfit, and has always lived in coastal cities), when I visited a hill station at 2.25 km above MSL I didn't really notice anything that made me breathe faster or deeper, so I guess the 20-25% less oxygen actually translates to just about 5% more breathing and 5% less physical strength.

So, suppose we take two athletes:

1. A person who has spent most of his life in towns at 2-2.5 km above sea level
2. A person who has always lived in coastal cities

And suppose both athletes are capable of doing the same sports with identical performance in their hometowns.

I agree that the high-altitude athlete would have the advantage when competing, regardless of whether the athletes were competing at sea level or at high altitude, but suppose we were to have a way to accurately measure peak strength and endurance as two separate parameters.

How big would the advantage (in each of the two parameters) realistically be in favour of the high-altitude athlete, if both of them were competing at mean sea level? My guess is that peak strength is equal and the high-altitude athlete has maybe 10% more endurance. (if endurance is measured as &quot;how long the athlete can do some exercise at a given intensity level for&quot;)

Note: I've chosen the 2-2.5 km range because the highest major cities in my country and in the USA are in that altitude range

Note 2: I made a similar post 2 hours ago but since that post was removed by Reddit's spam filters for linking to the air pressure calculator, I am reposting this and deleting that post.

Text: I understand that infrared wavelengths are felt as heat but is there different sensations (ignoring temperature) that would allow one to determine different “colours”? Thought came about from experiencing my cars heated seats and feeling that it felt different to how my heater at home would feel. Perhaps a different bandwidth of infrared?

Are there things that are just gone from our ability to observe, or will we be able to see further back by looking in the right places with more and more powerful telescopes?

Text: Good morning from Atlanta, I am a college student studying History, though I am also interested in Biology and taking a course with a lab this Summer. I am learning about Prokaryotic vs Eukaryotic organisms and their functions and noted that a key difference is that most Prokaryoteshave a cell wall to protect them from bursting due to water absorption. I also remember from prior knowledge knowing that our intestines contain a bunch of prokaryotes to aid in breaking down waste, etc. I was curious and didn't want to bother my professor with these random questions that pop up as I'm reading the textbook, so I figured I'd turn to you kind folks on here to enlighten me on this random burning question of mine:

Are there any diseases that can damage/destroy the cell walls of prokaryotes, causing them to absorb water throughout the body, i.e. the intestines and burst? 

Thanks!

I understand that if you are going to directly replicate a study, you would use all the same materials from the original study, but would you try and use the same amount of participants or try and get close to it? So, let's say that I try and directly replicate a study from 1992 on Adolescent aggression and video game usage, I would use all the same materials, so in this case, Street Fighter from 1992 on an arcade machine and then measure aggression using the same surveys from the original study.  But let's say the original study had 51 eleven year olds, would you try and get exactly 51 eleven year olds for your replication? or would you try and get close? or does it even matter?

It's something I grew up with and never really thought about, but when I looked it up today, I'm not really understanding if the dye itself has any active ingredients. Per my understanding, over-the-counter zelyonka is just the brilliant green dye crystals dissolved into diluted alcohol, so... Is it only antiseptic because of the alcohol? Or does the brilliant green actually have antiseptic properties on its own?

It is a stupid question but I'm in a middle of cooking and it just came to me.

Let's say I'm cooking diced chicken, in a big pan. Not enough to fill up the whole pan.

Would the pieces cook faster if they are all together and touching or would they cook faster if spread on the pan ?

I'm assuming the pan is heating evenly.

Text: So I was reading this news article: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/15/age-of-obesity-shaming-overweight-people. 

The author seems to suggest that between 1970 and today, sugar consumption in the USA has increased 39 times, and attributes this as a major cause the obesity epidemic. He pointed out that in 1970 people consumed slightly more calories but yet were thin.

I completely cut out all sweet tasting products from my life. I still eat around the same number of calories and yet in 6 months I've lost 40lbs of weight. Even when I was dieting and in calorie deficit but still consuming sugar, I struggled to lose weight. So I think there could be something true about this, as I don't even think about dieting nowadays and yet the weight just comes off anyway.

Does anyone here know why or how added sugar specifically would lead to rapid weight gain?

Text: To clarify my question with a (semi) made up example: say we trained a DL model to take some input data to predict some outcome (eg. amino acid sequence to predict protein conformation). Say we also have very little idea how to relate the outcome to the predictors. Then we did some form of interpretability on the DL model and this led to novel theory/insight (eg. certain amino acid subsequences are highly likely to appear on the surface of the protein once it is folded). 

Are there good case studies of this sort of thing happening? Links to papers would be super appreciated.

(Disclaimer: I know very little biochemistry so my example might be wrong/nonsense/known without DL)

Text: So, here’s my simplistic understanding of the two terms:
Electricity- the flow of electrons
Heat - the general movement of particles/molecules.

While these are not perfect definitions, I think they are fairly accurate. 
If you have electrical signals flowing through a copper cable, why can heat not change the bits being transmitted by disrupting the flow?

I realize that heat is a problem in computing, but usually that is at the processing points and affects materials in the computer rather than the signals, right?

Text: So I read that your body generates on average 50mL of blood every day. So what happens to the old blood? Where does it go? 

So blood cells die and deteriorate just like any other type of cell, but what happens to the blood then? Do your other cells absorb the collapsed blood cells? 

I guess I'm also meaning to ask, if your circulatory system is, for the most part, a closed loop system, what happens to blood cells when they die? Where do they go? 

And, this may be the weirdest question of all, what are the long term effects of blood doping? 

So your body has roughly 10 pints of blood in it. You take out a pint and refrigerate it, then wait for your body to regenerate 1 pint worth of blood, bringing your total back up to 10. 

Then you put that first pint *back* into your body. Does your body just permanently have more blood now? Does it sense that there's more than usual and stop producing new blood until the amount returns to normal? What happens there?

Text: I was trimming bushes when I noticed a small thorn stuck itself into my knuckle. My finger looked normal and didn't hurt, so I removed the small thorn and continued trimming. 30 seconds or so later I raise the same hand up again and noticed I had blood all over the finger, and some had dripped onto my pants. By the time I noticed this it had already stopped bleeding.

Did the thorn hit a vein or something, and removing it caused the area to bleed so much until it clotted? The area now has a bruise around a half inch in diameter.

This thorn was incredibly small, and the puncture isn't even noticeable. It's really hard for me to believe such a small &quot;injury&quot; could cause so much blood. How could that much blood escape an invisible little puncture in only 30 seconds?

I'm disappointed I didn't get to witness it.

Text: Say there's a cloud of plasma floating in space, and there's a uniform magnetic field around/permeating it. If there is also an electric field present, the plasma will move in the direction of E x B, from what I understand.

Now say there is a beam of laser light shooting through the plasma. Light is made of photons, which are electromagnetic oscillations.

So how does a photon end up affecting the plasma?

One option I could see is that the electric field from the laser and the background magnetic field means the plasma moves in the E_laser x B_background direction.

Another option is that it moves in the E_laser x B_laser direction.

Another option is that it doesn't move but oscillates back and forth along one of those directions, because light is oscillating.

Another option is that it moves in the direction the light was going, because light has momentum and its pushing the plasma. Which is just the 2nd option, but with a different reason.

Another option is that it doesn't move at all and I don't understand photons.

I've never forgotten this idea - it sounds plausible but as I've never heard the claim elsewhere I suspect it is wrong. Is there any basis for this?

Text:  

As I understand it, rhizomous plants look like separate plants but are often more like parts of the same plant, or at least clones. And from what I understand about genetics, historically when groups of people interbreed within a small group it can exacerbate the effects of negative genetic traits.

If I were trying to create and sustain a community of plants, and they happened to be rhizomous--like a yarrow plant--would it be enough to transplant several yarrow from one area (which are probably clones) to the target area? Or would it be necessary to go to separate locations to get &quot;different&quot; yarrow plants to seed an area?

If I just plant several of the clone plants would I have &quot;Habsburg lipped&quot; plants in a few years?

I have then been searching online, how the process of freeze drying actually works and found several sources. However, while reading I began wondering: These processes usually create ice crystal inside the material they want to dry. How does paper survive this process?

I can imagine, that the paper isn't too rigid, it can bend and deform given pressure unlike cell walls. Cell walls seem to be rather fragile as ice crystals can break them. However, if paper had been completely drenched/soaked in water, I would expect at least some damage to the paper. But apparently, freeze drying seems to be a very safe method, why is that?

I understand that many animals have sperm with short life cycles. I also understand that women are able to keep their same oocyte their whole life's. However eggs are living cells that are still attached to the host body and are being fed/wasted carried away from. Is this the same action that happens inside a queens body's when they store sperm for up to 25 years? Or is there a different mechanism of action?

If you have info related to other animals besides queen ants I'd be interested in hearing it as well.

If this is the case (please let me know if my assumptions are wrong), why does it seem like hybrid power trains of cars and boats have their combustion engines linked to the power train through a drive shaft rather than just producing more electricity to drive the electric motors? I get the sometimes they might be doing this to get more power and avoid having to install more powerful electric motors to accept the power from the generator rather than just the batteries, but it seems just having more range would a huge advantage. Is there something I'm missing?


Thank you!

Text: I've been watching prof. Michael Levin's work in regenerative biology and morphology, where he is working on how cells build bodies. He states that DNA contains no information related to a multicellular organism's three dimensional anatomy. 

Timestamped explanation.

&amp;#x200B;

But everything I see online, and everyone I ask online explicitly states that DNA tells cells how to build bodies. 

&amp;#x200B;

If Levin is wrong, and DNA does contain anatomical information, are we able to learn the anatomy of an animal, or even a simple plant *just* by reading the genome? Obviously without comparing it to a related organism.

Text: &gt; &quot;The mass, size, and shape of the object are not a factor in describing the motion of the object. So all objects, regardless of size or shape or weight, free fall with the same acceleration.&quot; Nasa

&gt; &quot;As such, all objects free fall at the same rate regardless of their mass.&quot;

So all objects fall at the same speed regardless of their mass. Therefore, an object's **mass doesn't matter**. Okay.

&gt; &quot;Terminal velocity will depend on the mass, cross sectional area, and drag coefficient of the object as well as the density of the fluid through which the object is falling and gravitational accelleration.&quot;

But now I'm told that **mass do matter**, and that an object with more mass will fall faster?

So do they or do they not fall at different speed...?

Obviously cans pressurised for use here on Earth would probably explode or be dangerous in a vacuum - but could you make a canned spray paint for use in space, using less or a different propellant, or would it evaporate too quickly to be controllable?

Desert cacti are supposed to have diverged and evolved during a worldwide drying event roughly 10-25 mya (I'm assuming the rainforest/vining species evolved at a similar time) This is relatively recent on the scale of plant evolution, is this why they're able to graft and breed so freely? They haven't had enough time to diverge to the point of incompatibility?

Text: I mean to ask this question both in total with all factors as well as if you disregarded humans transporting earth between different areas and the rising water levels due to climate change (which I guess answers the total, but I am not sure).

What I do know is that volcanoes erupting and the lava cooling down can create new islands, so I wondered whether more earth, sand and mass eroded into the sea or more surfaced due to lava.

When disregarding the continents and only looking at all islands (including new ones) it would also be a very interesting statistic. I have for example heard that the tallest volcano of spain on Tenerife was once a lot taller, but collapsed due to not being stable enough. I would guess that this made the total area over water bigger but reduced the mass over water.

I assume it might vary based on the type of rock, like maybe volcanic rocks are “born” when they emerge from a volcano, or sedimentary rocks are “born” when they harden from whatever swampy material they were before, but I’m not sure, and Googling mainly tells me that Dwayne Johnson was born in 1972, which is interesting but not helpful. Since just about every rock is made of material that has been around since the Big Bang, it’s confusing to know what science considers the start of a rock’s existence.

 I mean, there are some claims that due to how rigid the reinforced frame in heavy vehicles is, one is more susceptible to organ damage due to how kinetic energy is transferred. 

In case of lighter ones, they are intentionally made in a way that makes the body and chassis &quot;absorb&quot; the energy in order to reduce the damage the crash inflicts on the passengers. 

I guess the outcome of a collision could rely on the differences in weight between the participants.

As a layperson this strikes me as strange because it seems like a radio telescope would be significantly easier to build and launch than an optical telescope. 

A few possible guesses come to mind based on my small amount of astronomy knowledge:

Fewer advantages over land-based observation, relative to an optical scope?

Interferometry using huge numbers of smaller ground based dishes simply more useful?

Some engineering challenge I'm not considering?

Text: The way I understand it, vaccines use a dead, or weakened, virus. Some vaccines use only parts of a virus (or bacteria). And in the case of the Covid vaccines, they use mRNA technology. 

Now, the way I understand it, once this is introduced into the body, the immune system reacts and neutralizes the antigen. So, when the antigen enters the body a second time, the immune system reacts much quicker. I also understand that microbes can mutate, which has an effect on the vaccine's potency. This is why we have to get a flu shot every year, because the virus mutates. 

However, in the cases of Smallpox and Polio, we have managed to eradicate these diseases by way of vaccines. So, my question is it possible that, with vaccines, we were able to eliminate some diseases with vaccines, but not others? Did these other viruses just not have a chance to mutate? How would we get to the point where we don't let the flu or Covid to mutate? 

Please no &quot;Big Pharma&quot; conspiracies. I just want to know people's thoughts from a scientific standpoint. Thanks.

Text: Note that I'm not talking about &quot;growing the *most*&quot; (i.e. smallest baby size to adult size ratio). I'm talking about &quot;growing the *fastest*&quot;.

As of right now, I think it's the red kangaroo.

[This](https://www.nwf.org/Magazines/National-Wildlife/2010/Worlds-Fastest-Growing-Animal) and [this](https://www.ferris.edu/card-riley-center/Kids_Corner/marsupials.htm) say a red kangaroo is 1 gram at birth, and [the red kangaroo's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_kangaroo) [states that female red kangaroos can be of reproductive age (i.e. &quot;adulthood&quot;) as soon as 18 months](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_kangaroo#Reproduction) (but [that they weigh, at most, 88 pounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_kangaroo#Description)).

Using this information, let's say the following:

1. 1 year = 12 months = 365 days
2. 18 months = 365 \* 1.5 days = 547.5 days
3. 88 pounds / 1 gram = 39,916.1286

Plugging these values into [this exponent calculator](https://www.omnicalculator.com/math/exponent) tells me that, for a female red kangaroo to grow from its birth weight to its weight at adulthood in 547.5 days, it must multiply its body weight by 1.01954x (101.954%) per day.

Alternative, reversing this, and assuming the upper bound of red kangaroo reproductive age (5 years/1825 days), and the lower bound of female red kangaroo body weight (40 pounds), that means said female red kangaroo must multiply its body weight by 1.005387x per day (100.5387%) in order to grow from 1 gram to 40 pounds in 1825 days.

**Are there any mammals** **^((not animals,)** [***^(mammals)***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal)***)*** **that grow faster than this?** Right now, I think the red kangaroo takes the cake, seemingly growing 7.1x to *\~1,170x* its body weight within a year.

Thanks for all the help!

Text: I know many parasites have evolved to rely on a particular host species for part or all of their life cycle; is this common or uncommon for the ones that parasitize us? The only examples of parasites I know of that are dependent on us for survival are certain species of lice and certain intestinal hookworms. I know many other parasites like *Giardia* and *Trypanosoma* can infect a range of host species.

Text: As many of you already know, the Quetzalcoatlus was the largest flying animal to have ever taken to the skies. According to Wikipedia, the Quetzalcoatlus was well adapted for the ground as well as the air. It says that the Quetzalcoatlus's main diet was smaller dinosaurs that it could pluck from the ground, akin to today's stork. However, there is one sentence that really caught my eye:

&quot;Though Quetzalcoatlus, like other pterosaurs, was a quadruped when on the ground, Quetzalcoatlus and other azhdarchids have fore and hind limb proportions more similar to modern running ungulate mammals than to their smaller cousins, implying that they were uniquely suited to a terrestrial lifestyle&quot;

The mention of Quetzalcoatlus's limb structures being similar to known running animals is really fascinating to me. Could a Quetzalcoatlus give chase to a small animal on foot if it had to, galloping after it's prey like a horse?

So that has me wondering, if you had this very unethical  experiment where you could inject babies with some hormone cocktails, how much could you control by just controlling their hormones.

For example: Would you have enough control to have a baby turn into 6ft tall adult, with wide hips a big butt, large boobs and a 10 inch penis? Or how much of that would be coded into the DNA?

Text: I'm interested in the chemical reactions that happen between antioxidants and free radicals. There seems to be very little explanation on the internet of the actual chemistry that happens, and if there is it seems a bit too complicated for me.

Free radical = species with unpaired electron. Are all free radicals electrically neutral (not positive nor negative?)

From what I can see, antioxidants are also free radicals. They give an unpaired electron to a free radical. After this, both species have no unpaired electrons. Would they both have a charge of +1 or -1 now?

This makes antioxidants 'good for you' because they result in the free radical now having no unpaired electron, and there are no more chain reactions that occur. I am also curious: when a free radical takes an electron from a different molecule, what makes this reaction 'dangerous' for the body? Which molecule now would go on to be unstable and cause more dangerous reactions, is it the free radical that has been reduced or the other molecule that has been oxidised?

Text: My understanding of vapour pressure is that it is the pressure exerted by a vapour above a liquid when at equilibrium. Physically, this arises because some molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid phase in to the gas phase, and at equilibrium the number of molecules vapourising is the same as the number condensing. 

My question is does the vapour pressure depend on the external pressure? For example, if a volatile solvent was placed in a sealed flask, and it was pressurised with an inert gas, would the additional gas molecules hinder the evaporation from the liquid phase?

Text: I can probably understand why eating or smelling something nasty would provoke a gag reflex and induce vomiting. I guess when there is something in your body that couldn’t be accepted, gagging and vomiting act as ways to expel it. I could be misinformed so pardon my ignorance. 

However it dawned on me that even without taste or smell, we can experience the same physical reactions. For instance, I find spit, pee, vomit, certain kinds of food to be disgusting. Looking at these things can make me gag, tear up, and make me feel like I need to vomit. Even thinking about them alone can sometimes provoke such reactions. 

Why does that happen? Why does the body resort to a gag reflex and vomiting when the disgusting things aren’t directly affecting the body, especially internally? Is it because the brain already associates smell, texture, and taste with these objects we’ve come to experience so merely looking or thinking about these objects is similar to us being directly impacted by it?

Text: I was at my local rec center pool and had this thought.

Let's say you have a donut-shaped pool with jets that keep the water moving clockwise with negligible turbulence and a spherical object floating in that pool. Without bumping into the sides, would the ball begin spinning relative to the ground or stay facing relatively the same direction? 

Thinking about the forces involved, my intuition tells me that the force of the water acting on the ball should always be tangential to the donut. Also, would the stream of water keep the ball in the center, or would it be flung to the outside perimeter of the pool? How would the situation change if it were a neutrally buoyant sphere in a cylindrical pipe?

Text: This question was inspired by my understanding of immune response: A host becomes infected &gt; pathogen replicates until disease &gt; immune response &gt; eradication. At some point between infection and eradication there exists a critical mass of the pathogen such that the host becomes infectious.

An immunized host has memory cells that reduce immune response time. Is that shortened response time enough to prevent the host from becoming infectious before the pathogen is eradicated?

I figure this varies wildly from pathogen so let's just stick to COVID-19 (although additional examples would be great).

A few more things:

First, I'm out of my area of expertise (obviously) so please excuse any misuse of terminology, and please point it out.
Second, please don't hold back with your answers. If I wanted a simple explanation for something as if I was five years old I'd go to another sub (my post was auto deleted for referencing it). If I don't understand something I can go look it up. Hit me with your best shot =)

Text: When someone works out, lifts weights, runs, etc. When does the bulk of muscle recovery and repair occur?

Does the intensity matter? Short of a full muscle injury like a tear, does a harder workout with more strain on the muscles have a longer peak recovery? Are there things that can assist recovery or bolster it during that period—or hinder it?

Text: So I know in a camera that there's a bayer filter that makes color out of a black and white photograph, but for the JWST, it works in near infrared. Some news articles seem to say that it is able to un-red shift images from near infrared, but I assume, since it requires interpolation, that the JWST works in black and white and doesn't have a near infrared bayer filter equivalent. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is by what process is a color image generated from near infrared light? If it requires multiple types of wavelengths, how is that collected because I thought that it was a &quot;black and white&quot; camera sensitive to all unfiltered wavelengths equally

Text: I was reading earlier today about the kinds of ailments that bone marrow transplants are used to treat (as I am thinking about signing up on the registry to donate), and I noted that in the case of leukaemia, chemotherapy or radiotherapy is used to completely destroy the recipient's immune system first.

However, whilst relatively good, there are still figures that suggest that survivability over the years following treatment is not always that high, some still slip through the gaps.

But what causes these deaths after transplants over a long time since the procedure? Do the recipients somehow reject and attack the donated marrow? Does the new marrow eventually fail? But the recipient's immune system was destroyed, why can't the received marrow/immune system exist indefinitely, or a repeat/follow-up transplant procedure performed further down the line?

A follow-up question I have is are there grounds for marrow transplants to be used to treat immunodeficiency disorders such as CVID? I also read that some investigation has been performed into treating MS with bone marrow transplantation.

This is a long one, thanks in advance!

Text: Every single explanation of non-polar/polar interactions essentially says “non-polar substances have random slight charges that constantly change across the molecule and so are not attracted to the dipoles of water molecules.” I can’t, however, find any explanation to why the two substances (lets say water and oil) actually seperate. I saw a video of someone mixing the oil and water in space and the result was globules of oil randomly dispersed through the water. So in the case of separation of oil and water on earth is it just a case of the water molecules being attracted to each other, “slipping” past the oil and sitting at the bottom of the container due to density and in turn forcing the oil together?

Text: At an interested engineer, totally not a biologist level, I can smell things.  When I try to understand how smell works, though, I get confused.  I've heard a couple of answers which I'm not convinced by, so thought I'd get some clarity.

* Resonating bonds between atoms in molecules.  This sounds semi plausible, but it doesn't account for handedness, where (AIUI) for instance a left hand identical arrangement of atoms smells of lemon and the same atoms arranged right-handed smell of mint.

* That suggests shape is the driver, which seems compelling, but then why do brand new molecules we never evolved for have a smell?  Not perfume blends, that's obvious, but molecularly.  If we don't have a receptor for a molecule shape, how could we smell it, and how could we evolve a receptor for something that doesn't exist?

* Smell buds, and every aroma is a unique combination of the nose equivalent of bitter/sweet/salt/acid/umami.  This seems pretty unconvincing to me as with shape alone - how could novel molecules smell?

* Nose as a diffraction column.  Doesn't seem intuitive, but unique graphs for aromas at least includes the possibility of novel molecules having a smell, but we return to the handedness question.

What am I missing?  Am I overthinking it all, missing something obvious?  I mean it seems like something we should know, but I'm not seeing consensus.

Thanks for your ideas about this, it's troubled me a while!

* I was vaccinated in August 2021.
* I was infected by Covid-19 in October 2021. No hospital visit or monoclonal treatment required.
* Antibodies are said to be good for 90 days. 
* I chose not to get any boosters. 
* I have not been as “safe” as one could be, and have been in largely unmasked crowds on occasion. I have been to stores, out with friends, on vacation, etc. — always following Covid guidelines, but when given the option not to mask up, I have chosen not to. 
* Luckily, to my knowledge, I have not been infected by Covid-19 a second time. 

If your body produces antibodies after infection, is it possible that continued exposure to Covid would ensure your body continues to produce antibodies?

Why would continual exposure to Covid *not* act similarly to a booster?

It seems a very important point to understand how to prevent and treat depression. The extend to which depression is being talked about almost as a purely physical ailment like a broken leg or a weak heart in modern culture has helped destigmatize it but it just makes me wonder if this is really the right way to think about it. 

Thinking about it as a syndrome seems to put the problem on the shoulders of the individual rather than their enviroment (and vice versa).

Any input would be appreciated. Maybe some neurobiological insight?

Text: I was driving past an equestrian place the other day while there was a show happening. I drove past again the next day and all the horses were back in their fields quietly munching grass, and it got me wondering whether they had any memory of the previous day's events.

We know that animals are able to remember which plants or other animals are good to eat, and which ones are dangerous, but I wouldn't call this episodic memory. We also know that many animals can be trained to perform a certain action which they associate with a reward, but I doubt a dog is remembering what happened in training when told to sit - it's become an instinct. Conversely we know that abused dogs will exhibit fear of humans, of men, or of particular objects because of negative experiences associated with these things, but are the dogs remembering specific times that they were hurt by these things, or is it again just a learned instinct?

When we as humans recall a memory, we are to all intents and purposes experiencing a dulled down abbreviated version of the original sensory inputs that created it (although obviously the sensory neurons from the body aren't involved this time). We know that it's only a memory, but I'm wondering whether an animal would be able to make this distinction. Perhaps the horses in my introduction would become really confused as to why they were eating grass but at the same time being ridden around, hearing a crowd but at the same time not seeing one, then suddenly seeing a crowd but not hearing any noise, then chewing on grass again but at the same time feeling a bit in their mouths. Do animals possess the intelligence to distinguish memories from live experiences, or is this a reason why they can't possess episodic memory, because it would mess with their heads too much?

Certain pathways clearly lost associated SNPs while others gained some. What does this mean for these genetic pathways to have more or less associated SNPs?

Does each pathway correspond to a singular trait or set of traits?

Does having more SNPs mean these traits are expressed to a higher degree / magnitude?

For example, hsa04114 	Oocyte meiosis

Or 

hsa04740 	Olfactory transduction

1) Are all the known corrections enough? Or are there transitions that happen using a state that shouldn't exist according to the model? I.e., are all states from the Hydrogen atom in the model?

2) Do these corrections make a closed formula, or are they had to be done using numerical methods?

Text: This seems to be the latest scientific fact that the general population has latched onto and I get pretty skeptical when that happens. It seems like it could be the new &quot;left-brain, right-brain&quot; or &quot;we only use 10% of our brains&quot; myth.

I don't doubt that there's truth to the statement but what does it actually mean for our development and how impactful is it to our lives? Are we effectively children until then?

Text: Genetic testing for Tay-Sachs begin in the 70s.

Since then [the incidence of Tay-Sachs has fallen by more than 90 percent among Jews, thanks to a combination of scientific advances and volunteer community activism that brought screening for the disease into synagogues, Jewish community centers and, eventually, routine medical care.](https://www.timesofisrael.com/how-jewish-activism-has-wiped-out-tay-sachs/#:~:text=Since%20the%20'70s%2C%20the%20incidence,%2C%20eventually%2C%20routine%20medical%20care.)

[Until 1969, when doctors discovered the enzyme that made testing possible to determine whether parents were carriers of Tay-Sachs, 50 to 60 affected Jewish children were born each year in the United States and Canada. After mass screenings began in 1971, the numbers declined to two to five Jewish births a year, said Karen Zeiger, whose first child died of Tay-Sachs.](https://www.timesofisrael.com/how-jewish-activism-has-wiped-out-tay-sachs/#:~:text=Since%20the%20'70s%2C%20the%20incidence,%2C%20eventually%2C%20routine%20medical%20care.)

[Tay–Sachs disease is a genetic disorder that results in the destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.[1] The most common form is infantile Tay–Sachs disease, which becomes apparent around three to six months of age, with the baby losing the ability to turn over, sit, or crawl.[1] This is then followed by seizures, hearing loss, and inability to move, with death usually occurring by the age of three to five.[3][1] Less commonly, the disease may occur in later childhood or adulthood (juvenile or late-onset).[1] These forms tend to be less severe,[1] but the juvenile form typically results in death by age 15.](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease)

[Tay–Sachs disease is caused by a genetic mutation in the HEXA gene on chromosome 15, which codes for a subunit of the hexosaminidase enzyme known as hexosaminidase A. It is inherited from a person's parents in an autosomal recessive manner.](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease)

[Three main approaches have been used to prevent or reduce the incidence of Tay–Sachs:](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease&amp;section=8)

+ [Prenatal diagnosis. If both parents are identified as carriers, prenatal genetic testing can determine whether the fetus has inherited a defective gene copy from both parents.[30] Chorionic villus sampling (CVS), the most common form of prenatal diagnosis, can be performed between 10 and 14 weeks of gestation. Amniocentesis is usually performed at 15–18 weeks. These procedures have risks of miscarriage of 1% or less.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease&amp;section=8)
+ [Preimplantation genetic diagnosis. By retrieving the mother's eggs for in vitro fertilization, it is possible to test the embryo for the disorder prior to implantation. Healthy embryos are then selected and transferred into the mother's womb, while unhealthy embryos are discarded. In addition to Tay–Sachs disease, preimplantation genetic diagnosis has been used to prevent cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia among other genetic disorders.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease&amp;section=8)
+ [Mate selection. In Orthodox Jewish circles, the organization Dor Yeshorim carries out an anonymous screening program so that carriers for Tay–Sachs and other genetic disorders can avoid marrying each other.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease&amp;section=8)

Each of the mechanisms above would work to eliminate embryos with two Tay-Sachs genes, and preimplantation genetic diagnoses could be used to eliminate embryos with one Tay-Sachs gene, though I have no reason to think it is used that way.

By eliminating embryos with two Tay-Sachs genes, adults (who could reproduce) with Tay-Sachs are also eliminated and so I would think that over time, the genetic frequency of the Tay-Sachs disorder would decline.

Is there any evidence of this for Tay-Sachs?

Has the gene frequency of any recessive genetic disorder been reduced through screening mechanisms?

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/s93rpe/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxvi/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).
* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)
* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)
* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?
* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

\-------------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

Title: What's &quot;worse&quot;, longterm, for the greenhouse effect, CH4 or CO2?

Text: CH4 has a much larger greenhouse effect than CO2, but CO2 stays in the atmosphere much longer than CH4. So, if I had CH4 emissions and I had only two options, would it be better to burn them (emitting CO2) or leave the CH4 go freely to the atmosphere? What do simulations say?

Text: We cant see air and some gases because the particles that compose it dont have a color, right?

Is there any other compound with this property? All the other transparent things I can think of, like glass or water, are only partially transparent as they can still reflect light.

Also, can air in other planets with an atmosphere be made of different particles that reflect light, and therefore be visible? And why are gases particularly so... eager to be &quot;invisible&quot;?

Text: Hi! I am studying a program in Sweden which will allow me to work as a counsellor.

I'd be super grateful if anybody wants to take time out of their day to help me! :)

A study can be found if searched for via google, with the title:

Positive Effects of Methylphenidate on Social Communication and Self-Regulation in Children with Pervasive Developmental Disorders and Hyperactivity

It's on the website of NCBI. 

Within the study, under 'Discussion', in the last paragraph, the word &quot;clinical effect&quot; is mentioned: &quot;the greatest clinical effect was seen with the medium dose&quot; (Jahromi., et al 2008).

Precisely what is meant by &quot;clinical effect&quot; in that context?

Another sentence found in the last paragraph under discussion is: &quot;there may be greater disparity in dose-response across different domains for optimal change&quot; (Jahromi., et al 2008).

Precisely what is meant by &quot;domains&quot;?

Thanks in advance!

Logically, it seems once you get a virus, any bodily function should be able to spread it. Why do viruses behave the way they do?

Text: **TL;DR:**
A year ago, we did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/m5i6g5/askscience_ama_series_hi_reddit_we_are_group_of/) answering science or technology questions on any topic from Reddit. We had a blast and so we're back again! So please ask us any questions any of you have to do with science or technology and how they affect your life. There are no silly questions - ask us anything and we will try to give an easy-to-understand answer and, wherever possible, provide some further sources to enable you to do your own research/reading.


Our goal is simply to advance everyone's understanding of science, engineering, and technology and to help people be better informed about the issues likely to affect them and their families.

**More info / Longer read:**
CSES is a registered charity in the UK, founded in 1920. We're a volunteer group of over 250 members and our key strength is our diversity and interdisciplinary expertise. Our members come from a variety of educational, social, and economic backgrounds, from industry and academia and a multitude of age groups, representing groups from the millennials all the way to the Silent Generation (our oldest member being 98)!

There has been growing dis-information globally in the last 20 years. Today's global interconnectedness, while being hugely beneficial for making information easily accessible to everyone, has made it ever more difficult to determine 'truth' and who to trust. As an independent charity, not affiliated or biased to any particular group, but with broad knowledge we are here to answer any questions you may have and to hopefully point you to further reading!

Our goal is simply to answer as many of your questions as we can - but we aren't able to give advice on things - sorry! We will also be clear where what we are saying is the experience-based opinion of someone in our team.

So, Reddit... Ask us anything!

CSES will draw from its large pool of volunteers to answer your questions, however some of the people standing by to answer comments are:

+ **Professor David Humber**: Over 30 years' experience as a researcher, lecturer and senior university manager, specialising in immuno-biology and the life sciences.
+ **David Whyte BEM**: Technologist and Chartered Engineer with over 10 years' R&amp;D experience and 16 international patents across a wide range of technologies. Honoured by The Queen with a BEM, for services to engineering and technology.

Text: I figure that (economic) hard times equal, at least for some populations/groups, lower caloric consumption than usual, which could have some consequences for body size, in particular, height.

In particular if it happens to children or young adults still in the progress of growing, which i figure would be more sensitive to changes in intake(?), and therefore prevent them from reaching their full &quot;potential&quot;. 

Are there any data indicating that, e.g. &quot;population group X experienced economic difficulties in the year Y, which was reflected in a statistically detectable deviation/anomaly in the distribution for height for the group some N years later, compared to how it is normally&quot;

Text: If we look at the intensity vs wavelength graph in compton scattering experiment...,we see two peaks, one due to scattering from free electrons and the other due to scattering from tightly bound electrons.

But that doesn't make the intensities at other wavelengths zero... They are there, non zero but small... I suspect they appear due to scattering from no so tightly bounded electrons. 

But my question is why should they be so low? Like why is the concentration of free electron scattering and tight electron scattering so high compared to the rest(the no so tight electron scattering)...?

One of these is the unfolding argument. Can't seem to find any literature on how Zekis´ theory of the disunity of consciousness relates to this argument. He provides no function for consciousness, is he therefore subject to the unfolding argument, and could be considered a casual structure theory such as Lammes´ recurrent processing theory (2006) and Tononis´ information integration theory (2004)?

Text: For context I am a student in second semester college general chemistry, my upcoming lab we are using tartaric acid for analysis using acid-base titration, and in the lab introduction it mentions that tartaric acid is a diprotic acid and gives the molecular structure.  I am just confused how tartaric acid is diprotic since it contains four hydroxides in its molecular structure; does this mean that only two of its hydroxides are reactive?  Maybe it means that after two protons have been donated, the structure changes to where it is no longer able to donate protons?  Any insight is appreciated, thank you.

Text: I need to settle a debate with someone. To be clear, we are talking about your average, everyday pendulum like you'd find in a clock or by tying a washer to the end of a string, standing on earth. 

From what I've always learned, the equation T = 2π√(L/g) defines the period of a pendulum. Neither the mass of the bob nor the amplitude have any affect on the period of the pendulum, only the length of said pendulum can change the amplitude.

This person whom I'm debating is stating that with a &quot;huge change in amplitude&quot; (but didn't specify what &quot;huge change&quot; meant) the period will change. As I understand it, acceleration increases proportionally with amplitude and therefore the two cancel each other out.

When I brought that up, they said, &quot;an elliptic integral usually approximated with a series far too long for me to get into.&quot; and gave no other explanation. I have never studied this. I've asked for an explanation, but he's gone dark other than to say, &quot;it's too complicated to get into.&quot; 

So, can a &quot;huge&quot; change in amplitude change the period, and what exactly did he mean by the elliptical integral comment?

Text: Adam Savage pointed out that humanity's ability to adapt to our environment (and adapt our environment to ourselves)^1 has been a major evolutionary advantage.  Clothing seems like the earliest example of this kind of adaptation.  Unlike tool use for hunting/gathering, which definitely predated homo sapiens and shows up in other species, is use of tools for creating habitats unique to us?

Edit: I apologize for some added confusion on my part. I need to make an edit here because I think I didn't word my question correctly. 

I mean what if I ( or anyone else's) had participated in a study where proper consent was not given because of some kind of error on the part of the researchers. Like someone gave their consent, but it wasn't properly informed consent because of something like an omission of the risks, or failing to outline the responsibilities of the subject.

Text: In the UK, Network Rail explained why the UK rail infrastructure is unable to cope with hot temperatures, however, it also said that 'If we stressed our rails for exceptionally hot weather, they wouldn’t be safe for the winter and we’d have broken rail because it’s too cold.' 

What I'd like to understand is how the rail infrastructure in places that do experience extreme sides of weather is able to withstand the extremes. In my head I'm thinking of cities in North America on the east coast which experience very low and very high temperatures. How does their rail infrastructure cope with extremes? How are they built differently?

Text: In trying to research potential treatments for glioblastoma, I came across cannabinoids.  It seems like they all fight cancer (glioblastoma specifically) and could inevitably some day cure people's cancers.  There have been hundreds of studies, but as near as I can tell there has never once been a single study that tested these in live humans, without being administered in combination with chemo and radiation.  I heard a long time ago that they will never ever do that because if a person dies then someone gets blamed for not using chemo and radiation.  That kind of logic seems designed to forever prevent there from being any kind of cure or alternative to chemo and radiation, ever.

Do they ever do any in vivo studies on any (new or existing) cancer drugs that are not designed to see if the drug can &quot;assist&quot; chemo and radiation?  If not, is there any &quot;path forward&quot; for anyone to ever develop a drug that actually cures cancer?

Text: Keeping aquariums, including crawfish, shrimp, and crabs, I have obviously noticed that crawfish visually look a lot more like a shrimp than the average crab. In fact, at the store I work at, it takes a trained eye to distinguish between young crawfish and shrimp. I am assuming much of this applies to young lobsters as well, though all the ones I’ve seen have more distinguishable claws from an early age.

Anyways, I am trying to understand oceanic evolution through time and I’ve read that decapoda evolved into reptantia (lobsters and crabs) and natantia (shrimp). Does this suggest that lobsters are more closely related to crabs than shrimp, or am I misunderstanding something?

This region seems to really stand out in this graph from UNAIDS. Over the last decade, the only other region with a rise in incidence was Middle East And North Africa, but it was only a 7% increase, vs +43% in Eastern Europe And Central Asia.     



[https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media\_asset/2021-global-aids-update\_en.pdf](https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/2021-global-aids-update_en.pdf)

I gathered from this document by UNAIDS that the major disease burden in this region is on IV drug users, and the main hurdles to controlling the disease are punitive laws and social stigma (p.336, 338). But why is this region handling the disease so much worse than other regions, specifically Middle East And North Africa?           

It seems that these 2 regions have similarly oppressive political climate and legislature (Table 18.2 &amp; 19.2). The minorities also appears to be similarly marginalized. And according to the document, Eastern Europe And Central Asia had more resources available than Middle East And North Africa did (\~40% vs 20% of the resource needed for achieving 2025 goals) (Fig. 18.10 &amp; 19.6).      



I understand that this is probably a complicated issue with a myriad of factors at play. And I must admit that I do not know much about the political and cultural situation of these regions. To sum up, my question is: 

&gt;What are the major impetus to the remarkably worse HIV control in Eastern Europe And Central Asia, as compared to Middle East And North Africa, despite having a seemingly similar socio-political environment and higher resource availability?

Just wanted to get feedback from actual geneticists on that claim, as it is expounded more or less in this paper: [https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00361](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00361). I think this sounds like a load of eugenic bullshit (and that the idea of a co-ocurrence of a dysgenic trend with the Flynn effect is methodologically unsound), but I don't think I have enough knowledge of the subject to actually assert so. 

Is this a fringe theory, or is there any support for it in current genetic studies?

Text: I noticed today that when using two different brands of synthetic fertilizers with almost identical NPK levels I was getting a significantly higher EC. the PK levels of one brand of nutrient were higher but I did that math for both nutrient companies in order to ensure I was using identical amounts of RAW NPK. I found that I needed to use significantly more nutrients from one brand to get the same levels of raw nitrogen phosphorus and potassium than the other. After adding the nutrients of the &quot;low quality&quot; brand I noticed the EC was significantly higher (2.3) than the &quot;higher quality&quot; nutrients (1.9) but I'm still adding the same amount of RAW NPK to each tank. 
So my question is this, what exactly is causing the EC to be higher from one brand to the next, is it all the filler from using more nutrients to achieve the same NPK causing this? Or do cheaper/lower quality nutrients use more Iron boron calcium magnesium etc to synthesize their nutrients?

Text: So I've been trying to investigate these New Age claims that say our heart is basically an EMF transmitter but didn't find any convincing proof that this is actually true.

Obviously the heart operates through all sorts of phenomena, electricity being involved as well. Where there is current, there are electromagnetic fields. So it's obvious that SOME field could be detected if we would have a sensitive enough device.

But the problem is their claims seem especially outlandish. The research linked below argues that this EMF can even be detected several feet away, which sounds a bit crazy. If the heart would've had such a strong EMF, it would've been more common knowledge in our society. I mean, maybe they are kind of right. After all, they aren't mentioning any concrete values, they just say it's 100 times stronger than the brain's field (which I also doubt).

[https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-hearts-magnetic-field-which-is-the-strongest-rhythmic-field-produced-by-the-human\_fig11\_293944391](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-hearts-magnetic-field-which-is-the-strongest-rhythmic-field-produced-by-the-human_fig11_293944391)

I first heard about this claim here: [https://youtu.be/ta4w28IlzPE?t=1410](https://youtu.be/ta4w28IlzPE?t=1410)

This man named Joe Dispenza was making a lot of sense up to the timestamp I've selected.  
When he said the heart produces something similar to a WiFi signal, 3 meters wide, that's when my &quot;quack alarm&quot; started going off.

What's your opinion? Is all of this pseudoscience or is there any truth to it?  
Do you have any research to back up these claims?

Text: So often people talk about what animals are closest to us (chimps, monkeys, etc) but I've never really heard of someone talking about the most unrelated animal to us. So, in terms of what would be commonly referred to as an animal in every-day talk (so no single-celled organisms or things like that), what is furthest from us?

Edit: For clarity, by &quot;animal in every-day talk&quot; I just mean no single celled organisms, bacteria, etc. Things that are just so obviously far from us because they're so simple. Things like insects, sponges, etc all count. I eliminate them simply because while most likely correct, it's just not an interesting answer, and most people not in the scientific field wouldn't consider a bacteria to even be an animal in any way. For the sake of what discussion can be drawn from this, I want more interesting answers than the very obvious.

Text: I'm doing some research on the effects of UV radiation on skin and found that there is not much literature on exactly how tanning oils help the skin to darken faster/better. After reading around, the common phrase I come across is that it &quot;lowers the refractive index of the skin&quot; to permit greater penetration of radiation, but what does that phrase mean??

My thought is more inclined to the tanning oil refracting light like how immersion oil in light microscopy would refract light, but what does that have to do with the refractive index of skin?

The other explanation is in the moisturizing property of the oil sustaining the substrate accumulation for the melanocytes.

Popular science often tells that Mickelson Morley experiment proves it, but all parts of it are stationary relatively to each other.

So I would say it proves only that the speed of light is C if the source and the observer are in the same frame of reference, as far as I understand. Is there anything else?

Text: I have messed around quite a bit electrolyzing materials in order to generate hydrogen, oxygen and chlorine. I had very limited means and it was just a hobby project, but a consistent problem I had and I saw others having on the internet is the corrosion of the anode. Even stainless steel or graphite could not stand the test of time and I can imagine platinum electrodes are prohibitively expensive for industrial scale. Other options such as Mixed-metal-oxide seems too expensive for gigawatt scale production as well. Most hydrogen manufacturing websites only mention marketing buzzwords (&quot;ultra high density&quot; / &quot;innovative corrosion resistance&quot;) and no technical details. Perhaps it's all a bit of a trade secret, but I am quite curious!  


Sidenote, I can imagine it getting messed up when messing with NaCl electrolysis with chlorine and carbon steel electrodes. But if I recall correctly even NaOH solutions with stainless corroded after some time. So my question focusses specifically on hydrogen production.

Text: Hey there

In general, stars are moving away from us and, in combination with the doppler effect, this gives us redshift. When we look at stars with our eyes, they look more red than they actually are. When a picture is taken, the star looks more red than it actually is. This leads to two ways to represent a star in a picture (like [this one](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NXmL6bbh7QMA3xxfuu56uZ.png)):

1. The way a star looks for a human on earth (non-colour corrected for redshift)
2. The way a star *actually* looks (colour corrected for redshift). It would display the colour of a star like the star actually sends out.

And so rises my question: are pictures of stars colour-corrected for redshift? Do the pictures display a star like a human would see it, or how it looks in reality (as if you were right next to it)?

For example, in the picture linked above, the star at the centre is just a white spot. But let's take the orange star to the left bottom of the middle. Is it actually that red (colour-corrected)? Or does it look that red because of red shift (not colour-corrected)?

In school, in dutch, I learned the term &quot;Emission spectrum&quot; of a star (almost always hydrogen is used). I think the official english term is RVS? You can use that and the default (&quot;recorded&quot; on earth) to calculate the amount of redshift. If you know how much redshift there is, you can colour-correct a picture for redshift. So if you supply a picture of a star and it's RVS, you can do some calculations and color-correct a picture. However, when searching the web, I didn't find a single &quot;tool&quot; that could do this. Why isn't there any?

I just had this topic in physics class at school and I came up with these questions after his lesson and my teacher didn't know the answer, so here I am, asking it to you people. I hope you can shed some light!

If not, is the process of how they got there understood?  If so, does that imply that life on earth used to be more adapted to elevated levels of heavy metals?

Text: I think we all know what graphene is, and it's cheap production. 

During my time finding graphene online, I also found out that it can be manufactured into fibers. And an idea went up in my head: *&quot;What if I use graphene fiber, instead of carbon fiber?&quot;*. After all, it's more better in a lot ways than carbon fiber, especially in cost. Like, you can make your own graphene at home-type cheap. 

BAC motors made a sports car that has graphene body panels, probably using graphene in its' fiber form, that's what I think is most likely how they used it. I read an article about it, but the article didn't say how the graphene became as applicable as carbon fiber, like how BAC used carbon fiber. 

Does graphene fiber need to be impregnated with resin, like carbon fiber? Or no, it doesn't need to be impregnated with resin?

Text: When discussing topics like space exploration, underwater colonization, or even just the future of dense urban living and working, it often gets brought up that people may go insane from being subject to windowless conditions for too long. 

It seems like virtual windows (high-quality displays masquerading as windows to other, presumably more serene environments) would be a solution to this (and often is in science fiction).

I've seen one [study exploring the concept of virtual windows for the elderly](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-40244-4_45), and another on [stress recovery during exposure to natural and urban environments](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?journal=J.+Environ.+Psychol.&amp;title=Stress+recoveryduring+exposure+to+natural+and+urban+environments&amp;author=R.+S.+Ulrich&amp;author=R.+F.+Simons&amp;author=E.+Fiorito&amp;author=M.+A.+Miles&amp;author=M.+Zelson&amp;volume=11&amp;publication_year=1991&amp;pages=201-230&amp;), but I either can't find or can't access studies examining the actual effects on people in confined, windowless environments for long time periods.

Is there any research on this? And is there any evidence that it improves mental health?

Text: I'm into organizing, and plastic containers, storage boxes, and trays are the most commonly available items for that. I've recently become aware of the dangers of BPA (Bisphenol A), as well as BPS (Bisphenol S) (which is not flagged equally but considered just as dangerous) as endocrine disruptors and carcinogens. I've learned that it is strongly recommended to replace plastic when it comes to food containers. However, I have a few questions about the use of plastics in every day life that I have found opposing answers for when searching and I'd appreciate your take on:

1. Are plastic containers relatively safe (with or without BPA) as long as they're not used to heat up food? Is not using them for storing food in the fridge or at room temperature still highly recommended or are the risks exaggerated?
2. Do plastic containers/trays/storage bins (with or without BPA) for clothes, personal items, and paper pose similar risks? Should plastic be avoided to store and organize items in desks, closets, shelfs, etc, too?
3. Do the risks of doing 1 and 2 increase for a person with actual hormone problems?

Text: What I know is that the Poincaire group is characterised by, like, 9-10 commutation relations. And every field, before quantisation, is a vector space on which there must be representations of the Poincaire group defined as operators.

For instance, the operator e^(xd/dy-y/d/dx) is a representation of a member belonging to this group, and this operator acts on the vector space of fields, causing to rotate them. e^(d/dx) is another member of this group. Another member would be the exponentiation of Pauli matrices. Those don't operate on infinite dimensional fields, but rather on 2- component objects. Another member of this group could be 4x4 Lorentz transformations, which operate on 4 vectors. Bottom line : **every field that we quantise must have operators of this group defined on them.**

About SU1xSU2xSU3, I know that these are used as gauge groups. But idk much more than that. 

Have I understood them right? And **is there any connection between what these two groups have to do with physics?** Or are just important but independent ideas?

Text: I saw a bunch of studies and assertions that it ruins REM sleep. But I also saw stuff that says it's a miracle for sleep and anxiety and nightmares. These things don't seem to coalesce into one pattern; if it helps with anxiety, then it can't also not let you get real rest, becuase over time you would get worse anxiety from not being able to sleep. Bad sleep=more anxiety. Ditto nightmares, if you can't get real rest, then you get more nightmares. 

So what's going on? Is the data conflicting, does it matter who's being studied and why they're taking the drug, does it matter what particular type of thing they're taking, what ingestion method?

So, if spending time in green space is something we seem to need to thrive, what about the stars themselves? A big percentage of people have never seen the Milky Way at night because it's too bright at night now. I know people who didn't know it was something you could see with the naked eye, and had almost spiritual experiences seeing a proper night sky. Maybe it's a silly question, or maybe impossible to really study separately from the impact of artificial light in general.

And then the question came up. How do they talk almost like us if they have a totally different mouth? We change sounds based on our tongue and lips, but they have a beak, yet they can still sound *almost* human!

Thanks to anyone who might respond. :)

Text: And if it's the latter doesn't that mean deep sea fish have less oxygen because presumably its harder for oxygen to get way down there from the churning waves on the surface? Are there pockets of ocean that are oxygen deserts for fish because of lack of plants? How do deep sea creatures compensate for the reduced oxygen? Is bit comparable to land animals living on really tall mountains?

What's the difference here? Why do I seemingly need an infinite amount of energy to hold the spring closed but the vice doesn't? Where is that energy from me going?

Text:  

If we have a population of normal and cancer cells, and we give a drug to this population. And lets say this drug induces apoptosis. Usually, the drug would have a detrimental effects on the cancerous cells, but would pretty much cause the normal cells to be unaffected. How is that? If the drug can induce cell death in both normal and cancerous cells, why do the cancerous cells tend to die first? Is it because cancerous cells are way better at metabolism than non-cancerous cells, and so they suck everything from their environment; Therefore the normal cells get a small quantity of the drug, while the cancerous cells consume most of it and hence die?

(I know that some drugs might target  molecules that are unique to cancerous cells. However for the ones that are non-specific, how do these drugs manage to destroy our cancerous cells pretty well, while sort of not over-harming our normal cells)

Text: My understanding of math/physics is formally at an undergraduate level, so I apologize in advance if my questions are confusing or not very well formulated.

I've watched some videos about the holographic principle and how it was the attempts to solve the so-called black hole information paradox that lead to the development of string theories and the holographic principle. Ultimately this culminates in the correspondence between Anti-de Sitter spaces (a model of the universe under general relativity) and conformal field theories (i.e., quantum field theories). In the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klpDHn8viX8), the presenter tells us two things: 1.) That this correspondence leads to a &quot;natural&quot; theory of quantum gravity, and 2.) that interactions (between quantum particles?) on the boundary of the mathematical object's surface correspond to the emergence of gravity within the volume. However, he tells us that this isn't applicable to *our* universe, because anti-de Sitter spaces assume a negative curvature on the space-time metric, while as far as I understand, in reality it is zero (i.e., a Minkowski space-time).

So my questions are twofold: what quantum information is the problem here, and in need of conservation; are they things like spins and energies, and why does this lead to the holographic principle? Secondly, what is being said about the actual physics going on between quantum field theories and gravity with regards to this strange mathematical object?

Text: There are multiple arcs of light spreading from many of the galaxies shown in the deep field image from the James Webb Telescope. From googling I'm understanding that these arcs are generally the result of gravitational lensing caused by a mass outside the focus of the image. My specific question stems from the multiple arcs that aren't concentric.

I've worked to the perhaps invalid understanding that each non-concentric arc must represent a different lense (gravitational mass) How is a single perspective (the telescope) able to focus the light from multiple lenses at once?

Text: as the title says, it just seems like cancer rates are going up, but we've made tons of regulations, warnings and other things to show, limit or stop use of carcinogens. to me this means cancer rates should trend down. but they're not?? what would cause this in modern society???  are genes less healthy?? is our food worse?? are products really not that clean??

Text: I know that random mutations will produce &quot;nonsense&quot; and assume that at least some of the &quot;junk DNA&quot; we carry can be attributed to that, but I was wondering if some of it are fragments of vestigial DNA from our distant ancestors?

If it exists, can we tell the difference between those two categories of DNA and has any of that vestigial DNA been traced to its origin? I'm imagining that it's possible that we and chimpanzees share some junk DNA that's been hanging out since our ancestors diverged a relatively short time ago. Is this true?

Additionally, women are 50 to 75 percent more likely than men to experience an adverse drug reaction. &quot;

**So my question is, does transitioning with hormones (lets say a Transwoman/ Male to Female) have an effect on how the body reacts to medical treatment?** 

Also other interesting things I would like to know regarding that topic, are there differences in blood values between male and female, and how do transpeople get evaluated with that in mind.

Text: Consider the potential due to a pure dipole... It's 
V=k(p.r)/|r|^3 ... where r is position vector of the point at which the potential is considered and p is dipole moment of the charge distribution... 

Because the net charge Q=0, p remains the same even if we shift the origin... Now consider shifting the origin such that |r| remains the same but r doesn't so that p.r has a different value now... Therefore V has a different value in this frame...

Why? Isn't the potential at a point just the potential difference between this point and a chosen reference point(which happens to be infinity in this case) which shouldn't change unless you change the reference point itself? 

Any explanation???

Text: I am teaching myself about the processes by which penile tumescence occurs and is maintained.  I have found that part of the process of Ca^2+ sensitization that occurs in cavernosal smooth muscle cells is by the action of Src tyrosine kinases acting on BK(Ca) receptors by phosphorylating the alpha subunits.

However, what I don't understand is how exactly that phosphorylation winds up affecting the calcium levels?  Does it activate the ion gate?  Does it hyperpolarize the surrounding membrane?  Are other chemicals like cAMP or DAG involved? I am not a biochemist and I am but a humble physicist.  The publications on the matter seem to overlook this little detail as prerequisite material, so I'm at a bit of a loss.  I see how this works in Na ion channels as well as in vascular smooth muscle cells, but those seem to be operating by a different mechanism.

Text: I just got done watching a video about Parting of the Waters in Moran, WY. There is a unique feature here in which a creek running along the continental divide splits and half runs to the Pacific while the other half runs to the Atlantic. The title of the video is &quot;The Creek that Flows to Two Different Oceans&quot; if anyone wants to check it out for more context.

Anyway, it got me thinking: Assuming no evaporation, absorption into the soil, or any other means of exiting the continuous flow, how long would it take a drop of water to flow from that location all the way to the Atlantic Ocean?

There are overlapping issues like estimating actual path lengths of the creeks and rivers, different flow rates that depend on precipitation and water levels, fluid dynamics, and I'm sure a bunch other stuff I'm not even thinking of. Seems like such a cool multi-disciplinary problem. Is it possible to simplify it enough to get a rough answer? I'd love to hear everyone's take!

I'm not going to quote any sources but correct me if I get anything wrong. I did some googling and reading on Reddit, and heard that when you grow up obese, your body makes more fat cells to store fat and that number gets locked in after adolescence, or they won't be made except under extreme circumstances afterwards. Also that generally childhood obesity makes the body have a tendency / more &quot;biologically wired&quot; to store fat or more fat.

Let's say I have person A and person B. A had childhood obesity while B didn't, and both have the same stats that would be put in a TDEE calculator like [this one](https://www.freedieting.com/calorie-calculator) (sex, age, physical activity, etc.) except for weight, but if they enter in the same weight, both would get the same TDEE Result. If they both ate, let's say 2000 calories a day, would person A weight noticeably more, or they weigh about the same (and any difference would just be the result of being 2 different people)?

He says 

&gt;There’s a great seam, a famous seam-a world famous one-- which I believe is called the Great Atlantic Fault. And it starts in northern Spain in the Basque Country, and it goes under the Bay of Biscay and comes up in south Wales. Then it goes under the Atlantic and comes up in Pennsylvania. So that if you took a Basque miner, or a Welsh miner or Pennsylvanian miner, and you could blindfold them and transport them, and they will recognise the coalface the moment they see it.  I believe it's four feet, six inches.

It's a beautiful interview and it seems believable enough.  But I can't find any references to the &quot;Great Atlantic Fault,&quot; outside of quotes of the interview or from the 2014 movie &quot;Pride&quot; where Bill Nighy's character closely paraphrase's Burton's speech.  Granted Burton says, &quot;I believe it's called the Great Atlantic Fault&quot; so maybe he just got the name wrong.  But is this a real geological feature?

But I've read in another thread that wild bee hives don't slack, and once the hive is full of honey, they swarm and start a new hive with a new queen somewhere else.

Which of the two methods is better for the ecosystem? I would dare to guess that beekeept hives are better for orchards and fruit trees, as they keep a hive always nearby at full work, while wild hives are better for the wilderness as the colonies are more spread and and reach a larger area?

Also, aren't bees basically almost clones? Don't wild hives promote genetic diversity and are better posed for survival? (if not for a given hive, at least for a number of hives in the area)

However, evidence showing that societies and cultures away from Southeast Asia continued to develop after the eruption, which has seemed to debunk the Toba Catastrophe Theory.

However, that still doesn't explain the genetic bottleneck found in humans around this time. So, my question is, are there any theories out there that suggest what may have caused this bottleneck? Or has the bottleneck's validity itself been brought into question?

Text:  

I  haven't been able to get precise  answers on this one -- moving from sea  level to 10,000 ft for 3mos. of  work, I was advised to &quot;drink as much water as you possibly can&quot;, &quot;avoid  heavy drinking and caffeine&quot;, and to  &quot;eat at any time you're hungry at  all&quot; (for the whole time I'm at this  elevation).

What  is the exact  reason for this ? Does it have to do with less oxygen at  altitude ? What  makes the body fall to pieces if you don't practice  this constantly at high elevations ?

Especially breast cancer, what is it about the cells there that make easier to get cancer there than in other parts of the body? I know lot of cancer can be directly caused by someone's lifestyle like lung cancer for smokers, and I can kind of guess at ovarian and testicular cancer being common because I'd guess that since that region is just really like used a lot, with a lot of specialized stuff happening there all the time it makes sense.

Could there be planets where potential lifeforms might have to evolv to see x-rays or microwaves in order to observe their world?

If some planets received a different composition of light waves than ours I suspect it might be possible but I don't know if that is physically accurate. 

I know there are different types of stars and I know that the consensus is that a planet needs to be in the 'goldilocks zone' of a star to support life.

Text: A friend and I were arguing about the color of a car. I said it was pink. He said it was purple. I'm not a native speaker of English, so I wondered if that had perhaps something to do with it - perhaps my mother tongue delimited pink and purple differently than English. But asking some Americans, I found out that actually the jury was split. This got me thinking...  


\- Are some color boundaries fuzzier / more ambiguous than others? For instance, yellow might not be as contentious a color as others, but that is just my impression. 

  
\- If some color boundaries are fuzzier than others, is that consistent across languages? For instance, is the boundary between green and blue always fuzzy?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Are there any biological bases for color definitions, anchored perhaps in color perception and processing?  


I realize that this question straddles many disciplines, so I flaired it with Psychology but it could as well have been linguistic, anthropological etc.

If someone with asthma had other underlying health conditions and needed a lung transplant, but only one, and got a healthy lung--- Would they then have one healthy lung and one lung with asthma? 

Where does asthma reside in the body? In the lungs themselves or is there a 'control center' somewhere, where the healthy transplanted lung would also 'get' asthma? 

If not, how would the lungs function in an asthma attack? Would they breathe differently? Can lungs breathe independently of each other?

Original Antigenic sin is a concern for me.

So my question is, of all the other available surface epitopes of the virus, how much mutation has been going on there? I would wager that the Spike protein faces the most evolutionary pressure right now with the amount of vaccinated people. Are other surface antigens as variable?

What would be the advantages/disadvantages of an inactivated vaccine (e.g. *Valneva*) for a fourth vaccination?

Text: Lemons (which I buy from the market) have a high degree of axial symmetry.  Rotate them around their major axis, and they're usually pretty similar from all angles.  Cut one in half along the minor axis, and the segments are each about the same angular size.  The albedo is pretty circular and uniform, too.   


And then, the seeds.   There are usually fewer than one per segment.   And when that's the case, you just have 1 in one segment, another in another, and they jut off in seemingly random angles.   


Why the absence of azimuthal symmetry for seeds?

Text: I was recently thinking about multi grade motor oil and had a hard time understanding viscosity as a function of temperature.  So far as I understand, the idea is that the oil is less viscous when cold so it’ll run through a cold engine faster, ergo 10w30 would be a viscosity of 10 when cold and then 30 when warm.  But logically that makes zero sense to me; wouldn’t hot oil be less viscous?  One example a website gave was a marble being dropped into honey at two different temperatures and as expected the marble through warm honey traveled faster than the marble in cold honey.  So what am I missing here?

Text: General physics i learnt in highschool taught me that as any material reaches Absolute zero temperature the defects and flaws in it are removed and it becomes perfectly ordered in structure.
While when i am studying mineralogy and crystallography i see that many mineral's higher temperature polymorphs are more ordered than the low temperature. For example Akali feldspars high temperature polymorphs (Sanidine and Orthoclase) are Monoclinic in symmetry and the lower temperature polymorph (microcline) is in Triclinic symmetry.

As far as i understand monoclinic is supposed to be more ordered than triclinic. So what am i misunderstanding here? Why are these two things counter intuitive?

Beyond the characteristic erythema migrans (&quot;bullseye&quot;) rash, symptoms range from arthritis to damaging nervous and cardiac systems. With so many cases every year, it is imperative that everyone learn what steps can be taken to minimize and prevent Lyme disease infections while also getting up to date on the current scientific and medical interventions being used to treat and cure Lyme disease in infected individuals.

Join us today at 2 PM ET (18 UT) for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology, about all aspects of Lyme disease (and other tickborne diseases). We'll take your questions and discuss what people can do to prevent Lyme disease, how Lyme disease is best diagnosed and treated, and what to do if you suspect that you have Lyme disease. Ask us anything!

Is the fundamental limit to how fast a temperature can change based of a plank length, or something else? I suppose it must be linked to fundamental forces and atomic motion, but I can’t really get an intuitive sense of what might limit the speed of temperature change.

Text: I am a medical student and I am currently going through pulmonary physiology. I understand the concepts of diffusion and perfusion-limited gases, but there is one point in my physiology textbook which I cannot seem to understand.

When discussing DLCO, the textbook states that CO is a diffusion-limited gas. It then goes on to discuss the effects of changes in flow (Q) on DLCO and how doubling or halving flow does not impact DLCO, supporting that it is a diffusion not perfusion-limited gas. But I do not get why changing Q would not affect DLCO. Here is my take on it: Arterial CO pressure does not equilibrate with alveolar CO pressure by the end of the pulmonary capillary (i.e., diffusion-limited), but it still does rise slightly to some value lower than that of the alveoli. So wouldn’t increasing flow decrease contact time and thus cause an even lower arterial CO pressure throughout the pulmonary capillary and thus the gradient for CO diffusion would be greater than at lower flow rates? And therefore, a higher DLCO?

In support of my understanding, increased DLCO can be observed in obesity and is attributed to increased pulmonary blood flow in these patients.

Noteworthy to mention, the textbook does assume that pulmonary capillary dimensions are constant with changing flow. But still, I do not believe this would make the above reasoning false.

Thank you in advance!

Vh chain - 65 variable * 27 diversity * 6 joining

Vl(kappa) chain - 40 variable * 5 joining

Multiplying these numbers gives me just over 2 million unique sequences but I expected it to be far greater than that.

I’m using Immunology: The immune system in health and disease for the numbers of gene segments.

Thank you for the help!

Text: If you run a current through a wire, you create a magnetic field, and that magnetic field has a direction relative to the flow of the current. So if you were to explain to the aliens with no concept of left and right, you could tell them to set up an experiment where they connect a battery to a wire with the negative pole in a specified direction and the positive pole in the other. 

Then all you need to do is state that when viewing the wire from a perspective relative to the flow of the electrons, you observe the direction of rotation of the magnetic field, and at the &quot;up&quot; position (opposite the direction of gravity) is either right or left depending on the perspective relative to electron flow? Or am I missing something?

Text: My brother is training to be a fighter pilot and his training requires him to go through simulations that expose him to upwards of +7.5 Gs. My questions regards the risk of RV/LV hypertrophy due to the alterations in cardiac preload and afterlife from being under these Gs. 

I currently work as a scribe in pediatric cardiomyopathy and see a lot of HCM, and knowing the pathology of ventricular hypertrophy got me wondering if there was a risk on RV or LV hypertrophy in fighter pilots due to chronic exposure due intense +Gs

I read one study from Israeli fighter pilots that found no difference in cardiac dimensions by echocardiography when comparing pilots exposed to +Gs vs. -Gs (compared over a 5 year period). However are there studies that compare cardiac dimensions and functions of pilots to the baseline population not exposed to these type of G forces?

Text: Two reasons actually, first, how do we know they are still entangled from just one end? And does the knowing disrupt the entanglement?

So if we have two entangled particles and we send one out to orbit Jupiter (or anywhere far away) on a spaceship, can the people on the ship know if the particle is still entangled without disrupting the entanglement and without communicating at all with the people holding the other particle on Earth?

What if we had the tech to send sets of 26 entangles particle pairs on the ship, for simple example we send 3 sets of 26 entangled particles, and designate each pair in each 26 set a letter of the alphabet, then the people on earth interrupted the pair, in the first set of 26, with the designation of the letter Y causing it to disentangle so the people on the ship would know that we disentangled the letter Y pair. Then the second set the people on Earth caused the pair designated letter E to disentangle, and then the third set they disentangle the pair designated letter S, have we not just communicated FTL?

I'm a stupid monkey so just tell me why.

From what I understand bicephaly in reptiles is typically caused by either genetic or environmental factors, the most common being abnormal incubation temperatures. I was wondering if there is any sort of physical trauma that could result in bicephaly, such as an egg being dropped or slightly damaged? If so, would it be possible for scientists to make a notch in a developing embryo and encourage bicephaly? I know it's kind of morbid, but I was really curious as to whether or not physical environmental factors have an impact on this since I couldn't find many sources surrounding it!

Text: I have a scientific background mainly in math and computer science and some parts of evolution make sense to me like birds evolving better suited beaks or viruses evolving to spread faster. These things evolve in small changes each of which has a benefit.

But a circulation system needs a number of different parts to work, you need a heart at least 1 lung, blood vessels and blood to carry the oxygen around. Each of these very complex and has multicellular structure (except blood).

I see how having a circulation system gives an organism an advantage but not how we got here.

The only explanation I have found on the Internet is that we can see genetic similarities between us and organisms without a circulation system but that feels very weak evidence.

To my computer science brain evolution feels like making a series of small tweaks to a computer program, changing a variable or adding a line of code. Adding a circulation system feels a lot more than a tweak and would be the equivalent of adding a new features that required multiple changes across many files and probably the introduction whole new components and those changes need to be done to work together to achieve the overall goal.

Many thx

EDIT Thanks for all the responses so far, I have only had time to skim through them so far. In particular thanks to those that have given possible evolutionary paths to evolve form a simple organism to a human with a complex circulation system.

We're aware of the risks and big events that are possible with solar cycle maximums, but since a lot of news stories sound like they're trying to convince us that the sun is about to kill us all, we're looking for something a little bit more nuanced to give us some perspective. My friend is interested in astronomy but *also has astrophobia* so has been looking for something a little more reassuring than articles constantly popping up on his social media recommendations that exaggerate for clicks.

Text: I had heard that lemon juice makes your body alkaline, which made no sense to me, so I did some googling. I found that it was not true, as I anticipated (since your body regulates your blood's pH level), but what I couldn't find a solid conclusion for in either direction was whether or not lemon juice creates alkaline byproducts in digestion. 

I found many semi-reputable sources (https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/lemon-juice-acidic-or-alkaline for example) that seemed to agree with that, and say that while it doesn't affect your body or blood's pH level, it can make your urine more alkaline. Most of the people I'd seen refuting it where simply saying that lemon juice can't turn your body alkaline and that it's pseudoscience hogwash, rather than specifically talking to the point that it does or doesn't make alkaline byproducts during digestion.

So my question is: Does lemon juice produce alkaline byproducts during digestion and make your urine more alkaline, and if it does, what's the process that occurs to make this happen and what is happening to all the acid? Where are the extra Hydrogen ions going?

EDIT: Thanks for all the replies! Got some really good ones that answered my question with academic sources! Just wanted to note that as I mentioned, I know that your body regulates pH and that trying to turn your body or urine &quot;more alkaline&quot; doesn't have any health benefits, was just curious on this specific point of urine/alkaline byproducts because I couldn't find an explanation but saw relatively reputable sources suggest it's true.

Still, always good to include that as part of the explanation for others who may not know that it gives no health benefits.

Text: I thought that was exclusive to mammals and maybe birds, that the [Ancient Reptilian Brains](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Triune_brain) literally had not developed the “layers” responsible for what we'd call “emotions” (allegedly, the [Limbic System](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/lymbic%20system)?). Yet, I'm finding out many anecdotal examples of reptiles being loyal or physically affectionate. I'm very confused by this.

EDIT: a poster has brought up that we may be confusing “affection,” which only mammals can do, with “imprinting,” which “simpler” brains can manage. What are the differences between the two, in practice? Can one design tests to distinguish one process from the other, on a behavioral, empirical, tangible, objective level?

Text: Looking at [the Wikipedia page for absorption bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_band), it seems to me that there's a sizable window - i.e. a [local minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima) \- in the graph for [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation) absorption, as per [this image](https://i.stack.imgur.com/jOhUm.png).

[Water vapor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor), [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen), [ozone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone), and [methane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane) appear to be entirely transparent to radiation of 4 μm wavelength, [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) only appears to start absorbing it *after* that point, and even [nitrous oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide) has a window there. Moreover, [Rayleigh scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering) is also minimal there.

On top of *that*, [this Earth Science Stack Exchange answer](https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/13620/does-anyone-have-absorption-coefficients-at-different-wavelengths-for-sulfur-dio/13621#13621) and [its source](https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/13620/does-anyone-have-absorption-coefficients-at-different-wavelengths-for-sulfur-dio/13621#13621) show minimal (sub-0.5%) absorbance of [sulfur dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide) at that wavelength. Why is this? It seems like a rather odd coincidence for so many things to be transparent to 4 μm (a specific wavelength of mid-wavelength infrared) EM radiation.

As a coincidence, this is one of many parts why global warming is a thing, IIRC: mid-range infrared comes in through the 4 μm gap, gets soaked up by the Earth, and later gets re-radiated at different wavelengths that *do* get soaked up by the atmosphere.

I just don't know *why* there's a 4 μm gap there.

Text: As a Yemeni-American, I've noticed trends in how other first-gens from (loosely) similar regions and genetic backgrounds show greater susceptibility to certain diseases. 

I understand that we know, for example, that certain populations don't react well to alcohol on a genetic level, and have a greater propensity for addiction. Then, after enough generations of that, that population's gene pool has a greater physical tolerance or resistance to some of the negative effects of alcoholism. Yemen is an interesting case because many parts of it are inhabited by people who've resided there for such a long time and with so little mixing, relative to many other places.

Then of course there are the stark differences in lifestyles, and certain morphological or physiological advantages or disadvantages can become the opposite.

Do we understand more than this? I've read that genetics will require a quantum leap before we can more accurately analyze and predict disease susceptibility based on genetic markers, so I guess I'm just trying to get a read on how well we *actually* understand these topics, or even how we come to the conclusions we *can* draw.

My question is... If we were to compare the global number of mosquitoes+ants+flies living in a general area, would human action have significant influence on their number or no?

Arguments for yes: we (humans) are very invasive, and pesticides are powerful.

Arguments for no: the houses' area are insignificant compared to the wooded/grassy area. More over, we are creating a nutrition-rich environment for these insects and that's why they are around us. So we are killing as many as we produce.

The recent images that are released are stunning, but as with many space telescope images, they are false color. This is not a problem; it's still the real image, real data, and really beautiful, but while looking up how they do the false coloring [this article](https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/07/06/webbs-fine-guidance-sensor-provides-a-preview/) references &quot;color filters&quot; that are required for the telescopes operation.

Blue, green, and red are visible wavelengths, so how do these filters work with an infrared camera? Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;***This is the first time that detection of MPXV (DNA and virus by isolation) in environmental air samples from healthcare settings has been reported,.***  
&gt;  
&gt;***Detection of MPXV DNA in air samples collected at distances of greater than 1•5m from the patient and at a height of nearly 2m supports the theory that MPXV can be present in either aerosols, suspended skin particles or dust containing virus, and not only in large respiratory droplets that fall to the ground within 1 to 1-5m of an infected individual.***  
&gt;  
&gt;***Five out of fifteen air samples taken were positive. Significantly, three of four air samples collected during a bed linen change in one patient's room were positive (Ct 32-7-35-8). Interpretation: These data demonstrate significant contamination in isolation facilities and potential for aerosolisation of MPXV during specific activities.***  
&gt;  
&gt;***We identified widespread MPXV DNA contamination of the environment in respiratory isolation rooms occupied by infected symptomatic individuals.***

Text: The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease says that the accumulation of the peptide amyloid-β in the brain is the main cause of the disease. However, after decades of research and clinical trials there has been little to no success in treating Alzheimer's patients based on this hypothesis, and it has been questioned, see for example:

&gt;[The amyloid hypothesis on trial. As the development of treatments for Alzheimer’s disease continues to stumble, is it time for researchers to broaden their list of the condition’s potential causes?
](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05719-4)

It was recently reported that some western blot images which claim to show a sub-type of amyloid beta, Aβ\*56, may have been manipulated. The report was the result of an investigation by *Science*:

&gt;[Blots on a field? A neuroscience image sleuth finds signs of fabrication in scores of Alzheimer’s articles, threatening a reigning theory of the disease](https://www.science.org/content/article/potential-fabrication-research-images-threatens-key-theory-alzheimers-disease)

Such manipulations the report claims go back to the original 2006 paper describing Aβ\*56 in *Nature*  written by Sylvain Lesné and Karen Ashe:

&gt;[A specific amyloid-β protein assembly in the brain impairs memory](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04533)

From the report in *Science* one may get the impression that the vast majority of Aβ plaque-related research and drug development since then has been focused on the Aβ\*56 subtype, in which case the alleged fraud would be an enormous setback to the field, with billions of dollars and decades of research time wasted. However, there are many types of Aβ and I'm unclear on just how important Aβ\*56 is to the field of Alzheimer's research and drug development. My initial thought was that there's no way all this time, effort, and money has been invested in something that only one lab has published (even if they've published on it many times) and no independent researchers have validated. The *Science* report says that some others have detected Aβ\*56 but I don't know in what context, or if this other work validates the work from Lesné and Ashe:

&gt;In the 16 years following the landmark paper, Lesné and Ashe—separately or jointly—published many articles on their stellar oligomer. Yet only a handful of other groups have reported detecting Aβ\*56.

An article on Alzforum has comments from some of the scientists involved in the controversy:

&gt;[Sylvain Lesné, Who Found Aβ*56, Accused of Image Manipulation](https://www.alzforum.org/news/community-news/sylvain-lesne-who-found-av56-accused-image-manipulation)

In particular, the top comment which is from Karen Ashe, the senior author on the original 2006 paper:

&gt;...it is clear that there are two general forms of Aβ, type 1 and type 2. One particular form of type 1 (referred to in our papers as Aβ\*56 and in the Science article as “toxic oligomers”) was shown by my lab and others to impair memory function in mice. The type 2 form of Aβ is the one found in amyloid plaques. It is this latter form that drug developers have repeatedly but unsuccessfully targeted. There have been no clinical trials targeting the type 1 form of Aβ...

Scientific misconduct or fraud is of course terrible, and if true I'm sure this has set back at least some progress in the field. But just how significant is this fraud if it's true?

1st number is 0.1, 17th number is 0.71, 8241st number is 0.1428, 9218754th number is 0.4578129.

I think the size of both sets are the same? For Cantor's diagonal argument, if you match up every integer with a real number (btw is it even possible to do so since the size is infinite) and create a new real number by changing a digit from each real number, can't you do the same thing with integers?  


Edit: For irrational numbers or real numbers with infinite digits (ex. 1/3), can't we reverse their digits over the decimal point and get the same number? Like &quot;0.333...&quot; would correspond to &quot;...333&quot;?

So back when the space program was just starting, what was the technology they used to talk to people in space. Was it a series of broadcasting antennas around the globe? Something that has a strong enough broadcast range to pass through planetary bodies? Some kind of aimed technology like a satellite dish that could track the ship in orbit?

Text: In early May, reports began circulating about confirmed cases of monkeypox, an orthopoxvirus similar to smallpox. As of mid-June, there were over 2100 reported cases of monkeypox in dozens of countries. While a great deal is already known about the science of the monkeypox virus, this outbreak has raised several new questions about its transmissibility and impact on human health in both the short and long terms. With the world's attention heightened to such disease outbreaks due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this seems like a good opportunity to provide answers and help alleviate concerns.

We are experts in infectious diseases who are here to provide the facts about monkeypox and counter the mis-information that has been spreading about this disease. Join us today at 2 PM ET (18 UT) for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology, about the monkeypox outbreak. We'll answer your questions about the symptoms of monkeypox and how it spreads, current strategies for treatment and prevention, and what can be done to contain this (and future) outbreaks. Ask us anything!

Text: I see [here](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7122e1.htm?s_cid=mm7122e1_w) (under section: Contraindications To and Precautions Associated with Vaccinations to Prevent Orthopoxvirus Infections) that receiving a COVID vaccine within 4 weeks of JYNNEOS vaccine is not recommended, as a precautionary measure since the risk of myocarditis from JYNNEOS is unknown. 

I noticed it was mentioned that it mentioned shortly after, regarding the opposite scenario (COVID vaccine then JYNNEOS) that &quot;no minimum interval between mRNA COVID-19 vaccination and orthopoxvirus vaccination is necessary.&quot;

​The main question I have is, what mechanisms could be at play here that potentially increase the risk of myocarditis when receiving JYNNEOS then COVID vaccine, but NOT COVID vaccine then JYNNEOS?

Edit: If anyone was interested in the answer, I asked the person who wrote that article at the CDC and this is what they responded:

&gt;Thank you for your inquiry. There are no specific data on close administration of COVID-19 vaccines and Jynneos vaccines. The reason for consideration of a 4-week interval between the Jynneos first and mRNA second is because of the observed risk of myocarditis with mRNA vaccines and unknown risk of myocarditis with Jynneos. The reason there is no minimum interval when it is mRNA first and Jynneos second is because the benefits of Jynneos for prophylaxis given as soon as possible in the setting of an outbreak, outweighs the theoretical risk of myocarditis when administering them close together. Please continue to follow up with your local health care providers should you have additional questions or concerns. Thank you.

Text: I've read from several different sources that when a fresh injection of basaltic magma intrudes into a more silica-rich magma chamber under a volcano, some sort of reaction happens that ultimately leads to a large explosive eruption. I've specifically heard this implicated for the 19th century Krakatoa eruption, where people point to volcanic rock of varying color bands indicating partially mixed magmas that cooled preserving the different rock types. 

However, these sources don't mention a mechanism for this. Is there some sort of chemical reaction between the different magmas? Is it a physical reaction relating to different temperature/density/viscosity/gas content/something else?

What leads two bodies of relatively stable magma to generate immense pressure and explode when mixed together?

Text: Hopefully my question is alright! I hope I can get some answers. Lately I've been finding dead baby birds all over my backyard, and I hadn't a clue what was killing them. This morning I heard a terrible commotion and found five squirrels circling an adult collared dove like a pack of wolves. They took turns jumping on her back and attacking her. Then, later, the same squirrels started attacking one another! One seemingly nearly killed the other one - By the end of the fight it was hanging off of a tree branch, mouth open, clearly exhausted. It wasn't even holding onto the branch. Is this normal behavior for squirrels? What's the science behind this behavior? I've never seen it before!

Text: [The Highly Controversial Plan To Stop Climate Change](https://youtu.be/i4Hnv_ZJSQY)

I am not an environmental scientist, a climate scientist, nor a resource scientist, but I do have a fairly robust understanding of our current predicament in regards to climate change. The video I’ve linked presents Russ George, who claims that based upon his research, a planet wide bloom of phytoplankton could absorb a significant percentage of the world’s carbon. I have several questions about this.

Based on what I’ve seen, his message is backed by research. However, I’m unaware whether or not it is peer reviewed, or even seriously considered by others within his field. If it were to be true, then I would imagine climate scientists would be talking about this nonstop, but I’ve only just heard about it. I can’t tell, and any clarity on whether or not his work and claims are credible would be helpful.

If it is credible, then I have several further questions. What would be the ecological ramifications of having a phytoplankton bloom on a global scale? Beyond that, how much time would it buy humanity to switch over to carbon neutral methods of energy production?

Thank you in advance for any insight into this issue.

Text: Summary: Large solid chunk of steel submerged in a solution of copper(ii) sulfate and tin(ii) sulfate (estimated ration of 10-1). Left to sit for 24 hours. Reaction expected to produce precipitates of metallic copper and tin and a solution of iron(ii) sulfate.

Question: Would the copper and tin precipitate out as a metallic alloy, or would they come out as separate layers, crystals, etc.. ?

So... I've been messing around with copper(ii) sulfate for the past few days. One of my ongoing experiments started with putting scrap electronics solder in a solution of the stuff. My idea was the tin and lead would replace the copper and leave a solution of pure tin(ii) sulfate and insoluble lead(ii) sulfate and copper metal. The results were promising as I was left with a beautiful turquoise blue solution along with white precipitate of lead(ii) sulfate and copper collecting on the old solder. My only mistake was that I did not have enough solder, and so the resulting solution was still mostly copper(ii) sulfate.

It was this mixture of tin(ii) sulfate and copper(ii) sulfate that I added a slightly rusted steel hammer head to. I honestly didn't have a plan at this point other then a quick google search to see where iron was in terms of reactivity. Success on that: I now have an almost pure solution of iron(ii) sulfate. I will likely continue using sulfate to juggle metal ions with reckless abandon.

It's the hammer head I sacrificed that I'm really curios about. It's completely covered in copper crystals and I'm pretty certain the tin is mixed in as well. I'll link a picture in the comments. I really want to know if I just accidentally made a copper-tin alloy.

How effective is the vaccine, and if it's really effective, how is it made to be so effective year after year?

Text: Hello everyone hope you have a great day. So I just began studying the immune system and I have some questions. 
So if I understand it correctly so far, when pathogens enter the body they have to get recognized somehow, so the body can destroy them. So pathogens have these pamp (pathogen associated molecular patterns) that get recognized by the phagocytes with the help of &quot;toll like receptors&quot;. Also my textbook says something about opsonins, chemical compounds that &quot; mark&quot; the pathogens so phagocytes can recognize and destroy them. 

My questions are:
1) How did the cell evolve those toll receptors? Was it randomly but they stayed bc they are useful? Let's say you have a cell that no pathogen has ever interacted with it. So logically, the cell hasn't any receptor for it (or it has but it was a random generation-im not sure how it works). 
2) From my understanding, opsonins bind to the pathogen somehow and help the phagocyte recognize it. So opsonins have a lock-key relationship with phagocytes? It would make sense for the cell to recognize molecules that are part of the cell. But how do opsonins bind to the pathogens? My textbook isn't going on detail. 

Thank you for reading so far and sorry if my questions are stupid. Also sorry for any grammar or spelling mistakes, English isn't my first language.

But that's another story.

But the genes get inserted pretty randomly, which is weird to me. Do we just practically test the organisms afterwards to see which ones got the insertion right?

Or can we predict when or how often a gene will be expressed from its contents and location in the genome?

Or do we not know this yet?

My question is: How do I calculate the combined probability of me dying when first having eaten from the 30,000 basket, then the 2,175 basket? How much safer is that option than just eating from the original 250 apple basket?

Text: This question is specifically aimed at showing how asking high quantities of a population to take the vaccine stops the spread at a population level.

I would assume the following things to be relevant

1. chance of people who get infected that are vaccinated
2. chance of then infecting others, modulated by length of illness, viral load and symptoms (coughing)
3. how good the immunity is from infection + vaccine, i.e. how often vaccinated people get reinfected vs unvaccinated

Im asking this because its pretty frustrating that people always pull a specific country with high vaccination rates and high cases and then say young people getting the vaccine doesnt help others at all. I have the suspicion that their view is limited, but I would like to see evidence or more professional perspectives on the matter :)

Example: in my (old) car, I have a little adapter that plugs into the cig lighter socket; the cable plugs into that; and my phone then charges.  (Until recently, I naïvely thought it was nothing more than a voltage converter.)

* Does EVERY piece need to be at the same level of USB standard in order to get the higher charge rate?  IOW, if the little 12V adapter is 10+ years old, it's probably USB 1.0 and can't possibly deliver 100W even if the cable and device would like it, right?
 * (If that's the case, how does one address this issue?)
* What about these household [combination wall outlets](https://www.acehardware.com/departments/lighting-and-electrical/switches-outlets-and-plugs/outlets/3496551) : What USB version / charge rate will I likely get -- even WITH a USB-C cable?

Many thanks.  Apologies if this has been asked before; I -did- search but didn't recognise anything I could understand 😉 .

So, ever since I recovered from covid in May 2021, I've had this long covid wheezing and coughing it's not extreme just a little bit don't worry, anyway I was thinking, I just woke up from a night's sleep and I was coughing last night and now this morning. Why do we not cough in our sleep? Does coughing require consciousness? Or is it something else, maybe it could be related to our breathing patterns? Like when you try taking deep breaths to stop wheezing but cough bad while you exhale? Idk, I don't have anything near a biology background. 
Thank you in advance!
Ps:This may or may not be a stupid question so again, bear with me.

Text: For example, 1 2 3 4 5 6 exhibits a pattern. Each element is the previous plus one. 

But what if say, you know beforehand, the elements of a sequence are between 1 - 6 like in a dice. You’re trying to figure out if a certain sampling method is random. Say you get 3 2 1 2 2 1 3 1 2 2 1 3 2 1 1 2 3 1. The sequence itself doesn’t seem to exhibit a pattern yet they all share the same property of being within the set {1,2,3} and excluding the set {4,5,6}

Randomness is often defined as the lack of a pattern. This sequence by the face of it doesn’t seem to have a pattern yet we know it’s not coming from a uniform random distribution from 1-6 given 4 5 and 6 aren’t selected. How do you explain this?

In present day this area is rather dry, except the areas in Turkey and the river banks in Iran, Iraq and Egypt.

What are the estimates what kind of climate there was in those areas 10 000 years ago? They were probably much more fertile due to lower temperature. I would also guess that a large ice cap in Norhern Europe would have lowered the temperature even more, and also affected on the precipitation in the area.

Text: I am currently reading [The Selfish Gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene), and during one chapter he lightly touched on crossover during meiosis. I started thinking about crossover and I have a lot of questions that I can't really find the answer to. It seems like most places just touch on crossover as a step during meiosis, but don't really elaborate much. Anyway, here are my questions I hope someone can help me wrap my head around this:

* First of all: does crossover only happen (at most) once per chromosome? All diagrams look somewhat like [this](https://ib.bioninja.com.au/_Media/crossing-over_med.jpeg), which indicate that they swap only the ends. Is that the case, or are those diagrams an oversimplification and more than one &quot;pieces&quot; that are crossed over?

* If the answer to the above is yes, then I want to move onto this [meiosis diagram](https://cdn.lecturio.com/assets/Overview-of-meiosis-I-and-II-1200x1034.png). Is it true to assume then that we all likely possess entire chromosomes that came directly from our grandparents? In the diagram, each of the 4 cells has 2 chromosomes, one that's intact, and one that's crossed over. So for example, if my dad passed an &quot;intact&quot; chromosome 1 to me, there's a 1/4 chance that I'll pass that intact chromosome 1 to my son. Is that correct?

* How does crossing over work with the sex chromosomes? In the case of eggs, there's always two Xs, do those crossover? In the case of sperm, there's one X and one Y, do those crossover in anyway, or are they left alone?

* If the answer to question 1 is yes, then is there a pre-determined (approximate or accurate) length that's exchanged? If so, how is it determined? If it's random, what determines it? 

* Is the number of base pairs in an exchange the same on each side? Also, this question and the above assume it's done by number of base pairs. Is it &quot;calculated&quot; differently perhaps? Number of genes? Something else?

* Now, the question in the title: how does the process ensure that no really bad errors are introduced? If I understand correctly, it's not necessary that the two homologous chromosomes are the same length. One may have mutations the other doesn't, and vice versa. It's also likely those mutations are fine independently. But when mixed together, they could break things... so why doesn't it?

* And lastly: if question 1 is yes, has the existence of the crossover process lead to &quot;less important&quot; (or &quot;more ok to mutate) genes to be at the tips, and &quot;more important&quot; genes to be towards the middle? For example, per the question above, I imagine that eye color genes or genes that contribute to my face shape or skin color or traits like that are more &quot;ok&quot; to be mutated, where as for example, the gene for hemoglobin... you don't want to mess with that one.


Thanks for looking at my wall of text. I'm happy to restate questions if they don't make sense. Hope someone or many of you can help me with this.

Thanks again!

Text: Is there some kind of concept of evolutionary permanence that I can read about?

Like, of course there's DNA: no creature will ever evolve on Earth that is not based in DNA. Right? And probably something similar, if weaker, applies to all the various crazy proteins and other stuff that makes a cell work. Like, look at how conserved photopigments are across the animal kingdom (even beyond, you can find photopigments in non-animals that might be evolutionarily related to the opsins in human and fly retinas, etc etc).

Then you can get up to bigger scales, to things like cell types. Like, will there ever be a descendant of animals that has no neurons? It seems like, since neurons first evolved, they are *stuck*. I read a paper a while back on similarities between invertebrate and vertebrate neurons, and was amazed. They even use more-or-less the same neurotransmitters (if in different roles).

Then bigger: since insects invented wings, virtually none of them have lost them (ants, sort of - and a few other very weird examples). And insects always have that exoskeleton and always will - no insect will ever evolve with an endoskeleton, right?

And how tetrapods all have this 1-arm-bone then 2-arm-bone then lots-of-bones plan for their arms and legs (since they all started as fins-on-pegs). It seems like that just will never go away (though you might lose your arms and legs, like a snake, if you have them they always follow that plan).

What do we call this phenomenon?

There, the presence of two bands (test + control), no matter how faint, means that the sample is **negative** for the drug tested. On the other hand, the absence of a band in the test area means the sample is **positive**. 

This is of course the 'opposite' of how COVID-antigen tests work. Moreover, if the test is detecting the drug (or a secondary metabolite) through immunocolorimetry, the way these tests work make little sense.

Could anybody explain? It'd be greatly appreciated.

I was told recently that if your flame burns blue, it doesn't produce carbon monoxide (or not nearly as much as yellow). I don't see how that would work. The color of a flame (in a commercial gas combustion) is dependent on its temperature, I can imagine maybe, if your flame's yellow it partially burns the gas supplied, leading to more gas in the air, but certainly not carbon monoxide, no?

 Wouldn't just a few cells moving through the body be enough to &quot;infect&quot; another part of the body?

But how do they like move their fins to move thru the water shouldn't it be harder to move with all the pressure. Are their muscles stronger or do they just move slowly or what?

How did pre-Colombian Native Americans survive the severe weather that is relatively unique to the American heartland? How did the first, second, or third generation of European colonists survive some of the most destructive weather on our planet with little to no warning? I'm aware that weather has gotten more severe after industrialization but I really don't know how the random nomadic Native tribe managed to not get killed when an EF2 dropped down a mile away

Whose dna is in that blood?  If she drops some blood at a crime scene and the police swab it for evidence.  Will it match to her dna, will it have both sets of dna?  If it shows as the donors dna in the blood, does it change back to her blood over time?  What about organ donation?  That organ will always have the dna of the donor yes?

But hypothetically, if a climate was hot enough - but was still wet/humid/receiving large quantities of rainfall, could you get a &quot;desert&quot; (as in, dead/lifeless) that is still quite wet - but can't support life because of the extreme heat?

In other words, **how hot does it have to get** before plant/animal life can no longer survive **even** in the presence of large quantities of water?

When we see a planet, we are seeing light reflected back at us after scattering on the planet's surface.

But I've never understood how we 'see' the CMB. If it represents the early universe before any luminous structures existed (i.e. &quot;background&quot;), and that early universe is expanding away from us, what surface sent those photons toward us? Are they just flying in every random direction? 

I suspect I am just thinking about universal expansion incorrectly, but would love some clarification. Thanks!

Asteroids are rocky, airless remnants left over from the early formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago and NASA and our partners are always looking to the skies to study these ancient time capsules. From our missions [to explore the Trojan asteroids in Jupiter's orbit](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/lucy/in-depth/) and [bring a piece of an asteroid back to Earth](https://www.nasa.gov/osiris-rex), to our [efforts to find, track and monitor asteroids](https://www.nasa.gov/specials/pdco/index.html) and other near-Earth objects to protect our planet from potential impact hazards, we're uncovering the history of our solar system while working to keep our future safe.

Ask our experts anything about what we're learning from asteroids, how we're protecting the Earth, and much more!

Hoy, 30 de junio, es el Día internacional del asteroide, pero en la NASA, ¡todos los días son días de asteroides!

Los asteroides son restos rocosos sin atmósfera que quedaron de la formación temprana de nuestro sistema solar hace unos 4.600 millones de años. La NASA y sus socios miran constantemente al cielo para estudiar estas antiguas cápsulas del tiempo. Desde nuestras misiones para explorar los asteroides troyanos en la órbita de Júpiter y traer un trozo de asteroide de vuelta a la Tierra, hasta nuestros esfuerzos para encontrar, rastrear y monitorear asteroides y otros objetos cercanos a la Tierra para proteger nuestro planeta de posibles peligros de impacto, estamos descubriendo la historia de nuestro sistema solar mientras trabajamos para mantener nuestro futuro seguro.

Text: Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for 'X' were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;.

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

Text: Hello Reddit!    


I'm not looking for medical advice, but I am looking for an explanation! I just read some articles about mint tea and in almost all the articles it's written that you shouldn't drink mint tea if you're on low blood pressure medication, because it will enhance said medication. But none of the articles explain WHY it does! And then I thought; the Science Reddit  probably knows this. So, is there someone here who can explain to me why this is an effect that mint has?

Is it passed on during the formation of the egg? Or can it just survive for so long on water/surfaces that it's just a matter of time until they do?

While I  understand that HIV can be present in vaginal fluids, and perhaps the  main contributor of this may be the Bartholin glands, I have not found  any information on the presence of HIV in Skene's glands. Is HIV absent  in this fluid? If so, is that due to certain factors within the fluid  that make the virus unstable as with the case of saliva?

&amp;#x200B;

I have been learning about Piaget recently through the Introduction to Psychology Yale course ([https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6A08EB4EEFF3E91F](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6A08EB4EEFF3E91F)) and I was wondering if it would be possible, maybe through a set of tailored puzzles, to accelerate a child's advancement through Piaget's developmental stages.

 

\- Is there a physical limit for this (possibly that children gain these abilities not only through assimilation with their environment but also the physical growth of brain, therefore such puzzles/toys would not be effective as the child does not have the physical brain capacity to advance in their developmental stage yet?)

&amp;#x200B;

Any studies/videos regarding this topic would be greatly appreciated, let me know what you all think.

Text: I understand how the redox reaction works, but I can’t understand why electrons seemingly spontaneously decide to move across the wire to the cathode from the anode.

In the example of zinc and copper in an aqueous solution, it’s obvious why copper oxidizes zinc: they’re in physical contact. However in a galvanic cell they are separated by considerable distance. 

How is it that the cathode just *knows* the anode is there and current starts flowing when there’s no direct interaction between the oxidant and reductant?

If what we’re doing is looking into the early universe, and the universe has been expanding since the Big Bang, then aren’t we just seeing those first galaxies as they were closer together than they would be today? 

And if what we’re seeing is the very beginning of the universe then wouldn’t pointing the telescope anywhere else for a long enough time reveal a similar picture? In fact, wouldn’t we technically be seeing even the same early galaxies no matter where you point it at?

Text: *Observations:

Every time I trim my body hair, it grows back.

Now there can be two possible explanations for this:

*Explanation 1:

Body hair growth is continuous and hair grows indefinitely long if left ungroomed.

But I know this is not true, because for the first 18 years of my ife I never trimmed any hair, but they still didn't grow further after reaching a certain size.

*Explation 2:

There is some sort of feedback mechanism that let's the hair root cells know that the hair has been trimmed and they grow enough to compensate for the exact length that has been lost.

*Question:

But if hair is made of dead cells, how exactly can the body tell if that particular strand of hair has been cut

(I tried cutting out a patch of hair for this purpose and it grew to the same length as well after a few weeks)

And the exact length to which it has been cut?

....

I specifically put body hair in my question because I've never tested our the full limit of head hair, so I assumed it grows indefinitely.

Generally, most things on Earth have lifespans seemingly corresponding to their size.  Some flies live for days while larger animals live for years.  Of course there are exceptions, but its kind of a general rule.  Do scientists know, or can estimate, how long would, for example, a T-Rex take from egg to hatching, and from hatchling to natural end of life?  Are we talking a few decades, a hundred years, more than a hundred?  Something like the Brachiosaurus must take many decades to reach full maturity right?  If someone told me it took them 200 years to grow to that size I would not question it.

Text: I've read that Monkey Pox isn't an STD. So why is MSM, allegedly, the most afflicted group according to the WHO?

Edit: Unfortunately, I feel that the answers aren't clear enough and I still have doubts.

I understand that Monkeypox isn't strictly an STD, and it's mainly transmitted by skin-to-skin contact and respiratory secretions during prolonged face-to-face contact. So, I still don't understand why are the media and health organizations focusing specifically on the MSM demographic.

Even if the spread, allegedly, began in some sort of gay event, any person, regardless of sexual orientation,  could eventually get infected with Monkeypox. It's not as if MSM only had contact with other MSM. They might also spread the disease to their heterosexual friends, coworkers, acquaintances, and relatives.

In the worst-case scenario in which we aren't able to contain Monkeypox, LGBT people who don't even participate in random sexual encounters or social gatherings might get infected by heterosexual carriers.

Shouldn't the narrative be changed to &quot;people who partake in hook-up culture and large social events&quot;? What does sexual orientation have to do with the spread of the disease?

Edit2: I'm reading an alarming number of baseless assumptions and stereotypes about MSM or gay men in general, I honestly thought this subreddit was much better.

I know neutral is the return for the hot wire in 120v outlets in the USA. But in the USA, 120v is half of the 240v coming to the house. The other half is a grounding bus. Could someone explain it to me why we, USA homes need both, a neutral and a ground wire?

1. Does temperature measure translational, rotational, and vibrational motion?

2. If temperature measures average kinetic energy, couldn’t it just be expressed in terms of joules?

3. Is there a strict linear relationship between energy input and change in temperature? If not, why?

4. Does particle mass affect specific heat? If not why do particles have different specific heats?

5. What is the relationship between specific heat and specific entropy? Why do they have the same units?

6. If joules and kelvin both measure energy, then is entropy dimensionless?

Text: When we &quot;observe&quot; photons, they behave a different way, this is the &quot;spookiness&quot; and the lynchpin of quantum physics. Is applying the energy to the photon what causes the wave function to collapse? Or is it &quot;seeing&quot; it, like a thief having a 20% chance to of being in one of five houses, but that probability &quot;collapsing&quot; when we catch him in one specific house? Does that means Schrodinger's Thief isn't really in all 5 houses at once, right? Is the cat just a thought experiment to show absurd consequences of Copenhagen? 

Is observing/applying energy the same problem with a hypothetical graviton? Like if we abstract out a graviton, we can't measure it without adding to energy to it, which adds to the mass, which adds to the gravity, etc etc etc?

I assume that the closer I travel towards Andromeda (as impossible as that is) the brighter and more visible it will be and therefore it stands to reason that if I am *inside* Andromeda it will be incredibly bright. I mean, I'd be standing inside something which is giving off enough light to be seen from *Earth* in a whole other galaxy.

I assume our galaxy looks the similar from the perspective of an Andromedan so why does it ever get dark?

Text: I read that Si and GaAs, which are both used as semiconductors in computer chips, develop a very thin oxidation layer in air. I also read that the one that Si develops is insoluble in water, so it is a good passivation layer, while the one that GaAs develps contains water soluble oxides, so it is not a good passivation.

On the other hand in the industry, the GaAs oxidation layer is etched off with acid, when GaAs wafers are used - why is this done, and not just water used, if the oxides are water soluble? And how can I imagine the oxide layer itself, is it something that is firmly &quot;bonded&quot; to the GaAs or Si underneath, or is it something more &quot;volatile&quot; that is easily removed? As in: is it really part of the surface, or just &quot;lying on top of it&quot;?

I'm not a chemist, I just read a lot about semiconductor materials recently and am curious.

Can it really satiate hunger for some or is it just them convincing themselves that they are not hungry once they have watched those videos?

After insulin binds to the receptor, what happens to insulin itself? Does it get released from the receptor? Absorbed? Does it change/get recycled? Break down?

Text: Mold is a type of fungus and it is capable of fighting off bacteria in some cases, which lead to the discovery of antibiotics (penicillin, etc.) 

As we know, bacteria have begun to 'learn' how to overcome these antibiotics and we now have some types of infectious bacterial diseases that are immune to virtually all known antibiotics.

Would these 'super bacteria' also be dangerous to fungi, including molds and mushrooms? If so, what would that mean for the ecosystem and humans?

But I could find any answer (that I fully understood) as to why this happened.

I'm curious however if plants absorb pesticides directly into their flesh?

For example avocado... can you spray avocados with pesticides all you want and it will be safe to eat because you are removing the thick external cover? Or will the pesticide leach into the water, and then be absorbed by the plant, then eaten by you?

Or does it perhaps get absorbed directly through the skin?

Just curious!

r/AskScience, please tell me that protons literally spin microscopic turbines to create ATP.


Edit:  Thanks guys, my questions are fairly answered and given me more food for thought and direction to focus study.  My general takeaway from the thread is that these videos are close enough to &quot;reality&quot; to be presented to a student as such, with some small disclaimers that do not necessarily detract from the animations' accuracy.

Did it eventually slope down to ground/sea level at its edges? Or could you walk on dry ground next to it with open air on one side and a mile high wall of ice on the other? 

What happened when it encountered mountains? Did the ice move like glaciers or did the sheet just add and lose ice at the edges? 

How did weather work over the ice sheet if for thousands of miles in any direction, the “ground” was a over 5,000 feet higher than the rest of the continent and surrounding oceans? Did clouds run into it and get stuck? Did they exist over it?

Text: The technology/strategy behind mRNA vaccines is truly remarkable, but many explanations I've read seem to skip over a crucial logical step that is the basis of my question.

Once the mRNA enters a cell and the cell begins producing the protein that the mRNA encodes for, what are the processes between this stage and the stage of the immune system interacting with it? The state of affairs at this stage is a foreign protein inside the cell and it needs to end up in the &quot;hands off the immune system&quot;. If the protein in question is say the so-called &quot;spike protein&quot; of COVID-19, how does it get outside of the cell or to the surface of the cell? 

Cells are complicated^citation ^needed and usually have many interconnected parts like proteins helping other proteins get where they need to go or to fold in a particular way. Does the inherent shape/structure of the spike protein in this case make it thermodynamically favorable to embed itself in the cell's membrane and express itself outward? Proteins don't generally just leak out of cells so my current best guess is that it's presented by the cell in some way. Assuming this is the case, does that immune system now recognize that cell as foreign and destroy it (and thus 'read' the spike protein)?

Thanks for anyone's time.

Text:  I tried looking up some research on the subject, but could not find an answer.

To be more specific, birth control pills are associated with side effects relating to mood. The person in question is suffering from depression and brain fog after taking the pills, in addition to disrupted sleep patterns. We were wondering how the hormonal levels from the pills might be affecting the production of other hormones such as serotonin or melatonin (not an expert here but those are the two I mostly hear about).

Text: So, the DNA within the head of a capsid such as a lambda particle have these extensions at the 5’ strand of each end, called ‘cohesive’ or ‘cos’ ends. Apparently, they don’t bind to each other during packaging and they don’t bind to each other while bundled up inside the capsid. Once released into the host cell, however, they have no issues finding and then binding to each other. Why is that?

Text: Let's assume that, for some reason, a cell is using [active transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_transport) to move water out of itself or an organelle within itself - why, I don't know, but it is, perhaps it's trying to pull the water out of an [aqueous solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution) within itself, or perhaps trying to self-desiccate.

How much ATP would the cellular pump in question consume per water molecule it transports this way? Does it depend on the concentration of water on either side of the pump? Is there a correlation between the atomic mass of a molecule in [daltons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton_(unit)) and the amount of ATP required to force it through a pump?

Title: How big of an advantage does high-altitude training actually give to athletes? (say, at 2-2.5 km above mean sea level so with 20-25% less oxygen)

Text: According to an air pressure calculator I found on Google, the air at 2 km above MSL would be about 0.8 atm and at 2.5 km above MSL it would be about 0.75 atm.

As per my understanding, getting 20-25% less oxygen per breath would mean that a high-altitude athlete's body would have more RBCs, bigger lungs, and a bigger heart, and that should give a noticeable advantage to the high altitude athlete.

But from personal experience (as someone who is rather unfit, and has always lived in coastal cities), when I visited a hill station at 2.25 km above MSL I didn't really notice anything that made me breathe faster or deeper, so I guess the 20-25% less oxygen actually translates to just about 5% more breathing and 5% less physical strength.

So, suppose we take two athletes:

1. A person who has spent most of his life in towns at 2-2.5 km above sea level
2. A person who has always lived in coastal cities

And suppose both athletes are capable of doing the same sports with identical performance in their hometowns.

I agree that the high-altitude athlete would have the advantage when competing, regardless of whether the athletes were competing at sea level or at high altitude, but suppose we were to have a way to accurately measure peak strength and endurance as two separate parameters.

How big would the advantage (in each of the two parameters) realistically be in favour of the high-altitude athlete, if both of them were competing at mean sea level? My guess is that peak strength is equal and the high-altitude athlete has maybe 10% more endurance. (if endurance is measured as &quot;how long the athlete can do some exercise at a given intensity level for&quot;)

Note: I've chosen the 2-2.5 km range because the highest major cities in my country and in the USA are in that altitude range

Note 2: I made a similar post 2 hours ago but since that post was removed by Reddit's spam filters for linking to the air pressure calculator, I am reposting this and deleting that post.

Text: I've heard about how the JWST allows us to see things that happened close to the start of the universe.  I sort of understand how this works, but I was wondering if there is any sort of theoretical limit on how long ago something could have happened that we could see with the telescope?  Are there things that are just gone from our ability to observe, or will we be able to see further back by looking in the right places with more and more powerful telescopes?

How do these countries deal with melted tarmac? Are the chemical composition of the material different?

It seems to perfectly encircle the southern end of the Appalachian mountain range, suggesting it was somehow created when the mountain range formed.  It's not a river valley because a few rivers seem to cross through it without following it.  What is it?

Text: Good morning from Atlanta, I am a college student studying History, though I am also interested in Biology and taking a course with a lab this Summer. I am learning about Prokaryotic vs Eukaryotic organisms and their functions and noted that a key difference is that most Prokaryoteshave a cell wall to protect them from bursting due to water absorption. I also remember from prior knowledge knowing that our intestines contain a bunch of prokaryotes to aid in breaking down waste, etc. I was curious and didn't want to bother my professor with these random questions that pop up as I'm reading the textbook, so I figured I'd turn to you kind folks on here to enlighten me on this random burning question of mine:

Are there any diseases that can damage/destroy the cell walls of prokaryotes, causing them to absorb water throughout the body, i.e. the intestines and burst? 

Thanks!

Text: I know psychology has not had the best reputation when it comes to the results of studies being replicated, but my question stems around direct replication and the results pulled from those. I understand that if you are going to directly replicate a study, you would use all the same materials from the original study, but would you try and use the same amount of participants or try and get close to it? So, let's say that I try and directly replicate a study from 1992 on Adolescent aggression and video game usage, I would use all the same materials, so in this case, Street Fighter from 1992 on an arcade machine and then measure aggression using the same surveys from the original study.  But let's say the original study had 51 eleven year olds, would you try and get exactly 51 eleven year olds for your replication? or would you try and get close? or does it even matter?

It's something I grew up with and never really thought about, but when I looked it up today, I'm not really understanding if the dye itself has any active ingredients. Per my understanding, over-the-counter zelyonka is just the brilliant green dye crystals dissolved into diluted alcohol, so... Is it only antiseptic because of the alcohol? Or does the brilliant green actually have antiseptic properties on its own?

Would the pieces cook faster if they are all together and touching or would they cook faster if spread on the pan ?

I'm assuming the pan is heating evenly.

Text: So I was reading this news article: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/15/age-of-obesity-shaming-overweight-people. 

The author seems to suggest that between 1970 and today, sugar consumption in the USA has increased 39 times, and attributes this as a major cause the obesity epidemic. He pointed out that in 1970 people consumed slightly more calories but yet were thin.

I completely cut out all sweet tasting products from my life. I still eat around the same number of calories and yet in 6 months I've lost 40lbs of weight. Even when I was dieting and in calorie deficit but still consuming sugar, I struggled to lose weight. So I think there could be something true about this, as I don't even think about dieting nowadays and yet the weight just comes off anyway.

Does anyone here know why or how added sugar specifically would lead to rapid weight gain?

Are there good case studies of this sort of thing happening? Links to papers would be super appreciated.

Heat - the general movement of particles/molecules.

While these are not perfect definitions, I think they are fairly accurate. 
If you have electrical signals flowing through a copper cable, why can heat not change the bits being transmitted by disrupting the flow?

I realize that heat is a problem in computing, but usually that is at the processing points and affects materials in the computer rather than the signals, right?

Text: So I read that your body generates on average 50mL of blood every day. So what happens to the old blood? Where does it go? 

So blood cells die and deteriorate just like any other type of cell, but what happens to the blood then? Do your other cells absorb the collapsed blood cells? 

I guess I'm also meaning to ask, if your circulatory system is, for the most part, a closed loop system, what happens to blood cells when they die? Where do they go? 

And, this may be the weirdest question of all, what are the long term effects of blood doping? 

So your body has roughly 10 pints of blood in it. You take out a pint and refrigerate it, then wait for your body to regenerate 1 pint worth of blood, bringing your total back up to 10. 

Then you put that first pint *back* into your body. Does your body just permanently have more blood now? Does it sense that there's more than usual and stop producing new blood until the amount returns to normal? What happens there?

My finger looked normal and didn't hurt, so I removed the small thorn and continued trimming. 30 seconds or so later I raise the same hand up again and noticed I had blood all over the finger, and some had dripped onto my pants. By the time I noticed this it had already stopped bleeding.

Did the thorn hit a vein or something, and removing it caused the area to bleed so much until it clotted? The area now has a bruise around a half inch in diameter.

This thorn was incredibly small, and the puncture isn't even noticeable. It's really hard for me to believe such a small &quot;injury&quot; could cause so much blood. How could that much blood escape an invisible little puncture in only 30 seconds?

I'm disappointed I didn't get to witness it.

Text: Say there's a cloud of plasma floating in space, and there's a uniform magnetic field around/permeating it. If there is also an electric field present, the plasma will move in the direction of E x B, from what I understand.

Now say there is a beam of laser light shooting through the plasma. Light is made of photons, which are electromagnetic oscillations.

So how does a photon end up affecting the plasma?

One option I could see is that the electric field from the laser and the background magnetic field means the plasma moves in the E_laser x B_background direction.

Another option is that it moves in the E_laser x B_laser direction.

Another option is that it doesn't move but oscillates back and forth along one of those directions, because light is oscillating.

Another option is that it moves in the direction the light was going, because light has momentum and its pushing the plasma. Which is just the 2nd option, but with a different reason.

Another option is that it doesn't move at all and I don't understand photons.

But in other cases, it is argued that the carbon dioxide will drop down (as in fire suppression systems), or hot air will rise etc based on differing densities.

I've never forgotten this idea - it sounds plausible but as I've never heard the claim elsewhere I suspect it is wrong. Is there any basis for this?

If it is true, then what's the most massive a black hole could be to pass through the Earth without causing a commotion?

Text:  

As I understand it, rhizomous plants look like separate plants but are often more like parts of the same plant, or at least clones. And from what I understand about genetics, historically when groups of people interbreed within a small group it can exacerbate the effects of negative genetic traits.

If I were trying to create and sustain a community of plants, and they happened to be rhizomous--like a yarrow plant--would it be enough to transplant several yarrow from one area (which are probably clones) to the target area? Or would it be necessary to go to separate locations to get &quot;different&quot; yarrow plants to seed an area?

If I just plant several of the clone plants would I have &quot;Habsburg lipped&quot; plants in a few years?

Text: Recently there was a heavy downpour and I was told that the nearby library had to freeze dry books/papers in their magazine. Apparently, there had been a small water leak and parts of their inventory got wet.

I have then been searching online, how the process of freeze drying actually works and found several sources. However, while reading I began wondering: These processes usually create ice crystal inside the material they want to dry. How does paper survive this process?

I can imagine, that the paper isn't too rigid, it can bend and deform given pressure unlike cell walls. Cell walls seem to be rather fragile as ice crystals can break them. However, if paper had been completely drenched/soaked in water, I would expect at least some damage to the paper. But apparently, freeze drying seems to be a very safe method, why is that?

Text:  

I did google searched and searched this sub for an answer. The closest I got was the link at the bottom.

I understand that many animals have sperm with short life cycles. I also understand that women are able to keep their same oocyte their whole life's. However eggs are living cells that are still attached to the host body and are being fed/wasted carried away from. Is this the same action that happens inside a queens body's when they store sperm for up to 25 years? Or is there a different mechanism of action?

If you have info related to other animals besides queen ants I'd be interested in hearing it as well.

I get the sometimes they might be doing this to get more power and avoid having to install more powerful electric motors to accept the power from the generator rather than just the batteries, but it seems just having more range would a huge advantage.

Text: I've been watching prof. Michael Levin's work in regenerative biology and morphology, where he is working on how cells build bodies. He states that DNA contains no information related to a multicellular organism's three dimensional anatomy. 

Timestamped explanation.

[https://youtu.be/ZmRaIQOlxTY?t=654](https://youtu.be/ZmRaIQOlxTY?t=654)

&amp;#x200B;

But everything I see online, and everyone I ask online explicitly states that DNA tells cells how to build bodies. 

&amp;#x200B;

If Levin is wrong, and DNA does contain anatomical information, are we able to learn the anatomy of an animal, or even a simple plant *just* by reading the genome? Obviously without comparing it to a related organism.

Text: &gt; &quot;The mass, size, and shape of the object are not a factor in describing the motion of the object. So all objects, regardless of size or shape or weight, free fall with the same acceleration.&quot; Nasa

&gt; &quot;As such, all objects free fall at the same rate regardless of their mass.&quot;

So all objects fall at the same speed regardless of their mass. Therefore, an object's **mass doesn't matter**. Okay.

&gt; &quot;Terminal velocity will depend on the mass, cross sectional area, and drag coefficient of the object as well as the density of the fluid through which the object is falling and gravitational accelleration.&quot;

But now I'm told that **mass do matter**, and that an object with more mass will fall faster?

So do they or do they not fall at different speed...?

I was thinking of incorporating that into the design of the base of one of my miniatures (where I think it has an Apollo-retro meets Space-Roughneck kinda vibe) but then I wasn't entirely sure whether that's even physically plausible...

Obviously cans pressurised for use here on Earth would probably explode or be dangerous in a vacuum - but could you make a canned spray paint for use in space, using less or a different propellant, or would it evaporate too quickly to be controllable?

Text: Cactaceae are the only family I know of where almost any species can be successfully grafted to almost any other species. Almost every cactus is capable of producing fertile, hybrids within its genus. Beyond that, it's been found that many cacti are even capable of intergeneric hybridization. Desert cacti are supposed to have diverged and evolved during a worldwide drying event roughly 10-25 mya (I'm assuming the rainforest/vining species evolved at a similar time) This is relatively recent on the scale of plant evolution, is this why they're able to graft and breed so freely? They haven't had enough time to diverge to the point of incompatibility?

Text: I mean to ask this question both in total with all factors as well as if you disregarded humans transporting earth between different areas and the rising water levels due to climate change (which I guess answers the total, but I am not sure).

What I do know is that volcanoes erupting and the lava cooling down can create new islands, so I wondered whether more earth, sand and mass eroded into the sea or more surfaced due to lava.

When disregarding the continents and only looking at all islands (including new ones) it would also be a very interesting statistic. I have for example heard that the tallest volcano of spain on Tenerife was once a lot taller, but collapsed due to not being stable enough. I would guess that this made the total area over water bigger but reduced the mass over water.

I assume it might vary based on the type of rock, like maybe volcanic rocks are “born” when they emerge from a volcano, or sedimentary rocks are “born” when they harden from whatever swampy material they were before, but I’m not sure, and Googling mainly tells me that Dwayne Johnson was born in 1972, which is interesting but not helpful. Since just about every rock is made of material that has been around since the Big Bang, it’s confusing to know what science considers the start of a rock’s existence.

 I mean, there are some claims that due to how rigid the reinforced frame in heavy vehicles is, one is more susceptible to organ damage due to how kinetic energy is transferred. 

In case of lighter ones, they are intentionally made in a way that makes the body and chassis &quot;absorb&quot; the energy in order to reduce the damage the crash inflicts on the passengers. 

I guess the outcome of a collision could rely on the differences in weight between the participants.

TLDR: would a heavy vehicle be a better option safety wise? Or are there other factors in play?

Text: I had a recent urine test and failed to show any of the medication that should have been present (I had last taken it 30 hours earlier but the internet says it usually stays detectable 48-98 hours.)

Just wondering if a high acidity level in my blood/urine or diabetes itself could cause the medication to excretes faster than normal.

Text: So searching for radio telescopes I found that there are almost none currently operating in space and historically very few as well. Most of the big radio dishes in space are turned Earthwards for spying purposes.

As a layperson this strikes me as strange because it seems like a radio telescope would be significantly easier to build and launch than an optical telescope. 

A few possible guesses come to mind based on my small amount of astronomy knowledge:

Fewer advantages over land-based observation, relative to an optical scope?

Interferometry using huge numbers of smaller ground based dishes simply more useful?

Some engineering challenge I'm not considering?

Text: The way I understand it, vaccines use a dead, or weakened, virus. Some vaccines use only parts of a virus (or bacteria). And in the case of the Covid vaccines, they use mRNA technology. 

Now, the way I understand it, once this is introduced into the body, the immune system reacts and neutralizes the antigen. So, when the antigen enters the body a second time, the immune system reacts much quicker. I also understand that microbes can mutate, which has an effect on the vaccine's potency. This is why we have to get a flu shot every year, because the virus mutates. 

However, in the cases of Smallpox and Polio, we have managed to eradicate these diseases by way of vaccines. So, my question is it possible that, with vaccines, we were able to eliminate some diseases with vaccines, but not others? Did these other viruses just not have a chance to mutate? How would we get to the point where we don't let the flu or Covid to mutate? 

Please no &quot;Big Pharma&quot; conspiracies. I just want to know people's thoughts from a scientific standpoint. Thanks.

Text: Note that I'm not talking about &quot;growing the *most*&quot; (i.e. smallest baby size to adult size ratio). I'm talking about &quot;growing the *fastest*&quot;.

As of right now, I think it's the red kangaroo.

[This](https://www.nwf.org/Magazines/National-Wildlife/2010/Worlds-Fastest-Growing-Animal) and [this](https://www.ferris.edu/card-riley-center/Kids_Corner/marsupials.htm) say a red kangaroo is 1 gram at birth, and [the red kangaroo's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_kangaroo) [states that female red kangaroos can be of reproductive age (i.e. &quot;adulthood&quot;) as soon as 18 months](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_kangaroo#Reproduction) (but [that they weigh, at most, 88 pounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_kangaroo#Description)).

Using this information, let's say the following:

1. 1 year = 12 months = 365 days
2. 18 months = 365 \* 1.5 days = 547.5 days
3. 88 pounds / 1 gram = 39,916.1286

Plugging these values into [this exponent calculator](https://www.omnicalculator.com/math/exponent) tells me that, for a female red kangaroo to grow from its birth weight to its weight at adulthood in 547.5 days, it must multiply its body weight by 1.01954x (101.954%) per day.

Alternative, reversing this, and assuming the upper bound of red kangaroo reproductive age (5 years/1825 days), and the lower bound of female red kangaroo body weight (40 pounds), that means said female red kangaroo must multiply its body weight by 1.005387x per day (100.5387%) in order to grow from 1 gram to 40 pounds in 1825 days.

**Are there any mammals** **^((not animals,)** [***^(mammals)***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal)***)*** **that grow faster than this?** Right now, I think the red kangaroo takes the cake, seemingly growing 7.1x to *\~1,170x* its body weight within a year.

Text: As many of you already know, the Quetzalcoatlus was the largest flying animal to have ever taken to the skies. According to Wikipedia, the Quetzalcoatlus was well adapted for the ground as well as the air. It says that the Quetzalcoatlus's main diet was smaller dinosaurs that it could pluck from the ground, akin to today's stork. However, there is one sentence that really caught my eye:

&quot;Though Quetzalcoatlus, like other pterosaurs, was a quadruped when on the ground, Quetzalcoatlus and other azhdarchids have fore and hind limb proportions more similar to modern running ungulate mammals than to their smaller cousins, implying that they were uniquely suited to a terrestrial lifestyle&quot;

The mention of Quetzalcoatlus's limb structures being similar to known running animals is really fascinating to me. Could a Quetzalcoatlus give chase to a small animal on foot if it had to, galloping after it's prey like a horse?

Like oestrogen influences growth of breast tissue for example and there is this other hormone that affects growth and there are many other hormones that affect all kinds of stuff. Correct?

So that has me wondering, if you had this very unethical  experiment where you could inject babies with some hormone cocktails, how much could you control by just controlling their hormones.

For example: Would you have enough control to have a baby turn into 6ft tall adult, with wide hips a big butt, large boobs and a 10 inch penis? Or how much of that would be coded into the DNA?

Text: I'm interested in the chemical reactions that happen between antioxidants and free radicals. There seems to be very little explanation on the internet of the actual chemistry that happens, and if there is it seems a bit too complicated for me.

Free radical = species with unpaired electron. Are all free radicals electrically neutral (not positive nor negative?)

From what I can see, antioxidants are also free radicals. They give an unpaired electron to a free radical. After this, both species have no unpaired electrons. Would they both have a charge of +1 or -1 now?

This makes antioxidants 'good for you' because they result in the free radical now having no unpaired electron, and there are no more chain reactions that occur. I am also curious: when a free radical takes an electron from a different molecule, what makes this reaction 'dangerous' for the body? Which molecule now would go on to be unstable and cause more dangerous reactions, is it the free radical that has been reduced or the other molecule that has been oxidised?

Text: My understanding of vapour pressure is that it is the pressure exerted by a vapour above a liquid when at equilibrium. Physically, this arises because some molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid phase in to the gas phase, and at equilibrium the number of molecules vapourising is the same as the number condensing. 

My question is does the vapour pressure depend on the external pressure? For example, if a volatile solvent was placed in a sealed flask, and it was pressurised with an inert gas, would the additional gas molecules hinder the evaporation from the liquid phase?

Text: I can probably understand why eating or smelling something nasty would provoke a gag reflex and induce vomiting. I guess when there is something in your body that couldn’t be accepted, gagging and vomiting act as ways to expel it. I could be misinformed so pardon my ignorance. 

However it dawned on me that even without taste or smell, we can experience the same physical reactions. For instance, I find spit, pee, vomit, certain kinds of food to be disgusting. Looking at these things can make me gag, tear up, and make me feel like I need to vomit. Even thinking about them alone can sometimes provoke such reactions. 

Why does that happen? Why does the body resort to a gag reflex and vomiting when the disgusting things aren’t directly affecting the body, especially internally? Is it because the brain already associates smell, texture, and taste with these objects we’ve come to experience so merely looking or thinking about these objects is similar to us being directly impacted by it?

Text: I was at my local rec center pool and had this thought.

Let's say you have a donut-shaped pool with jets that keep the water moving clockwise with negligible turbulence and a spherical object floating in that pool. Without bumping into the sides, would the ball begin spinning relative to the ground or stay facing relatively the same direction? 

Thinking about the forces involved, my intuition tells me that the force of the water acting on the ball should always be tangential to the donut. Also, would the stream of water keep the ball in the center, or would it be flung to the outside perimeter of the pool? How would the situation change if it were a neutrally buoyant sphere in a cylindrical pipe?

Text: This question was inspired by my understanding of immune response: A host becomes infected &gt; pathogen replicates until disease &gt; immune response &gt; eradication. At some point between infection and eradication there exists a critical mass of the pathogen such that the host becomes infectious.

An immunized host has memory cells that reduce immune response time. Is that shortened response time enough to prevent the host from becoming infectious before the pathogen is eradicated?

I figure this varies wildly from pathogen so let's just stick to COVID-19 (although additional examples would be great).

A few more things:

First, I'm out of my area of expertise (obviously) so please excuse any misuse of terminology, and please point it out.
Second, please don't hold back with your answers. If I wanted a simple explanation for something as if I was five years old I'd go to another sub (my post was auto deleted for referencing it). If I don't understand something I can go look it up. Hit me with your best shot =)

Text: I was reading earlier today about the kinds of ailments that bone marrow transplants are used to treat (as I am thinking about signing up on the registry to donate), and I noted that in the case of leukaemia, chemotherapy or radiotherapy is used to completely destroy the recipient's immune system first.

However, whilst relatively good, there are still figures that suggest that survivability over the years following treatment is not always that high, some still slip through the gaps.

But what causes these deaths after transplants over a long time since the procedure? Do the recipients somehow reject and attack the donated marrow? Does the new marrow eventually fail? But the recipient's immune system was destroyed, why can't the received marrow/immune system exist indefinitely, or a repeat/follow-up transplant procedure performed further down the line?

A follow-up question I have is are there grounds for marrow transplants to be used to treat immunodeficiency disorders such as CVID? I also read that some investigation has been performed into treating MS with bone marrow transplantation.

This is a long one, thanks in advance!

Text: Every single explanation of non-polar/polar interactions essentially says “non-polar substances have random slight charges that constantly change across the molecule and so are not attracted to the dipoles of water molecules.” I can’t, however, find any explanation to why the two substances (lets say water and oil) actually seperate. I saw a video of someone mixing the oil and water in space and the result was globules of oil randomly dispersed through the water. So in the case of separation of oil and water on earth is it just a case of the water molecules being attracted to each other, “slipping” past the oil and sitting at the bottom of the container due to density and in turn forcing the oil together?

Text: At an interested engineer, totally not a biologist level, I can smell things.  When I try to understand how smell works, though, I get confused.  I've heard a couple of answers which I'm not convinced by, so thought I'd get some clarity.

* Resonating bonds between atoms in molecules.  This sounds semi plausible, but it doesn't account for handedness, where (AIUI) for instance a left hand identical arrangement of atoms smells of lemon and the same atoms arranged right-handed smell of mint.

* That suggests shape is the driver, which seems compelling, but then why do brand new molecules we never evolved for have a smell?  Not perfume blends, that's obvious, but molecularly.  If we don't have a receptor for a molecule shape, how could we smell it, and how could we evolve a receptor for something that doesn't exist?

* Smell buds, and every aroma is a unique combination of the nose equivalent of bitter/sweet/salt/acid/umami.  This seems pretty unconvincing to me as with shape alone - how could novel molecules smell?

* Nose as a diffraction column.  Doesn't seem intuitive, but unique graphs for aromas at least includes the possibility of novel molecules having a smell, but we return to the handedness question.

What am I missing?  Am I overthinking it all, missing something obvious?  I mean it seems like something we should know, but I'm not seeing consensus.

Thanks for your ideas about this, it's troubled me a while!

* I was vaccinated in August 2021.
* I was infected by Covid-19 in October 2021. No hospital visit or monoclonal treatment required.
* Antibodies are said to be good for 90 days. 
* I chose not to get any boosters. 
* I have not been as “safe” as one could be, and have been in largely unmasked crowds on occasion. I have been to stores, out with friends, on vacation, etc. — always following Covid guidelines, but when given the option not to mask up, I have chosen not to. 
* Luckily, to my knowledge, I have not been infected by Covid-19 a second time. 

If your body produces antibodies after infection, is it possible that continued exposure to Covid would ensure your body continues to produce antibodies?

Why would continual exposure to Covid *not* act similarly to a booster?

Text: How would we know the difference? 

It seems a very important point to understand how to prevent and treat depression. The extend to which depression is being talked about almost as a purely physical ailment like a broken leg or a weak heart in modern culture has helped destigmatize it but it just makes me wonder if this is really the right way to think about it. 

Thinking about it as a syndrome seems to put the problem on the shoulders of the individual rather than their enviroment (and vice versa).

Any input would be appreciated. Maybe some neurobiological insight?

Edit: arguably this is a psychology or even philosophy question but I'm specifically interested to know if any neurobiological research has been done on this.

Text: I was driving past an equestrian place the other day while there was a show happening. I drove past again the next day and all the horses were back in their fields quietly munching grass, and it got me wondering whether they had any memory of the previous day's events.

We know that animals are able to remember which plants or other animals are good to eat, and which ones are dangerous, but I wouldn't call this episodic memory. We also know that many animals can be trained to perform a certain action which they associate with a reward, but I doubt a dog is remembering what happened in training when told to sit - it's become an instinct. Conversely we know that abused dogs will exhibit fear of humans, of men, or of particular objects because of negative experiences associated with these things, but are the dogs remembering specific times that they were hurt by these things, or is it again just a learned instinct?

When we as humans recall a memory, we are to all intents and purposes experiencing a dulled down abbreviated version of the original sensory inputs that created it (although obviously the sensory neurons from the body aren't involved this time). We know that it's only a memory, but I'm wondering whether an animal would be able to make this distinction. Perhaps the horses in my introduction would become really confused as to why they were eating grass but at the same time being ridden around, hearing a crowd but at the same time not seeing one, then suddenly seeing a crowd but not hearing any noise, then chewing on grass again but at the same time feeling a bit in their mouths. Do animals possess the intelligence to distinguish memories from live experiences, or is this a reason why they can't possess episodic memory, because it would mess with their heads too much?

Nature published this article which basically takes a look at the change in # of snips within various genetic pathways between Neolithic/Bronze Age Europeans and modern Europeans.

Certain pathways clearly lost associated SNPs while others gained some. What does this mean for these genetic pathways to have more or less associated SNPs?

Does each pathway correspond to a singular trait or set of traits?

Does having more SNPs mean these traits are expressed to a higher degree / magnitude?

For example, hsa04114 	Oocyte meiosis

Or 

hsa04740 	Olfactory transduction

And 

hsa05204 	Chemical carcinogenesis

1) Are all the known corrections enough? Or are there transitions that happen using a state that shouldn't exist according to the model? I.e., are all states from the Hydrogen atom in the model?

2) Do these corrections make a closed formula, or are they had to be done using numerical methods?

Text: Genetic testing for Tay-Sachs begin in the 70s.

Since then [the incidence of Tay-Sachs has fallen by more than 90 percent among Jews, thanks to a combination of scientific advances and volunteer community activism that brought screening for the disease into synagogues, Jewish community centers and, eventually, routine medical care.](https://www.timesofisrael.com/how-jewish-activism-has-wiped-out-tay-sachs/#:~:text=Since%20the%20'70s%2C%20the%20incidence,%2C%20eventually%2C%20routine%20medical%20care.)

[Until 1969, when doctors discovered the enzyme that made testing possible to determine whether parents were carriers of Tay-Sachs, 50 to 60 affected Jewish children were born each year in the United States and Canada. After mass screenings began in 1971, the numbers declined to two to five Jewish births a year, said Karen Zeiger, whose first child died of Tay-Sachs.](https://www.timesofisrael.com/how-jewish-activism-has-wiped-out-tay-sachs/#:~:text=Since%20the%20'70s%2C%20the%20incidence,%2C%20eventually%2C%20routine%20medical%20care.)

[Tay–Sachs disease is a genetic disorder that results in the destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.[1] The most common form is infantile Tay–Sachs disease, which becomes apparent around three to six months of age, with the baby losing the ability to turn over, sit, or crawl.[1] This is then followed by seizures, hearing loss, and inability to move, with death usually occurring by the age of three to five.[3][1] Less commonly, the disease may occur in later childhood or adulthood (juvenile or late-onset).[1] These forms tend to be less severe,[1] but the juvenile form typically results in death by age 15.](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease)

[Tay–Sachs disease is caused by a genetic mutation in the HEXA gene on chromosome 15, which codes for a subunit of the hexosaminidase enzyme known as hexosaminidase A. It is inherited from a person's parents in an autosomal recessive manner.](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease)

[Three main approaches have been used to prevent or reduce the incidence of Tay–Sachs:](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease&amp;section=8)

+ [Prenatal diagnosis. If both parents are identified as carriers, prenatal genetic testing can determine whether the fetus has inherited a defective gene copy from both parents.[30] Chorionic villus sampling (CVS), the most common form of prenatal diagnosis, can be performed between 10 and 14 weeks of gestation. Amniocentesis is usually performed at 15–18 weeks. These procedures have risks of miscarriage of 1% or less.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease&amp;section=8)
+ [Preimplantation genetic diagnosis. By retrieving the mother's eggs for in vitro fertilization, it is possible to test the embryo for the disorder prior to implantation. Healthy embryos are then selected and transferred into the mother's womb, while unhealthy embryos are discarded. In addition to Tay–Sachs disease, preimplantation genetic diagnosis has been used to prevent cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia among other genetic disorders.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease&amp;section=8)
+ [Mate selection. In Orthodox Jewish circles, the organization Dor Yeshorim carries out an anonymous screening program so that carriers for Tay–Sachs and other genetic disorders can avoid marrying each other.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease&amp;section=8)

Each of the mechanisms above would work to eliminate embryos with two Tay-Sachs genes, and preimplantation genetic diagnoses could be used to eliminate embryos with one Tay-Sachs gene, though I have no reason to think it is used that way.

By eliminating embryos with two Tay-Sachs genes, adults (who could reproduce) with Tay-Sachs are also eliminated and so I would think that over time, the genetic frequency of the Tay-Sachs disorder would decline.

Is there any evidence of this for Tay-Sachs?

Has the gene frequency of any recessive genetic disorder been reduced through screening mechanisms?

e.g. 5\` GUCGAUGCUUGGUAGUAAG......... 3\`

The only potential initiation site is AUG, so why do we say that this could encode 3 different proteins?

Text: **Please read this entire post carefully and format your application appropriately.**

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/s93rpe/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxvi/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).
* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)
* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)
* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?
* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

\-------------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

`Username: /u/foretopsail`

`General field: Anthropology`

`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`

`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`

`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`

`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

You can submit your application by replying to this post.

Text: Hi! I am studying a program in Sweden which will allow me to work as a counsellor.

I'd be super grateful if anybody wants to take time out of their day to help me! :)

A study can be found if searched for via google, with the title:

Positive Effects of Methylphenidate on Social Communication and Self-Regulation in Children with Pervasive Developmental Disorders and Hyperactivity

It's on the website of NCBI. 

Within the study, under 'Discussion', in the last paragraph, the word &quot;clinical effect&quot; is mentioned: &quot;the greatest clinical effect was seen with the medium dose&quot; (Jahromi., et al 2008).

Precisely what is meant by &quot;clinical effect&quot; in that context?

Another sentence found in the last paragraph under discussion is: &quot;there may be greater disparity in dose-response across different domains for optimal change&quot; (Jahromi., et al 2008).

Precisely what is meant by &quot;domains&quot;?

Thanks in advance!

Text: I have viral conjunctivitis and I was cautioned about washing my hands and not sharing towels etc.

But it got me thinking, what makes certain viruses only spread via a particular vector?

For example AIDS and blood/sex, Coronavirus is airborne/fomite tramissions, etc.

Logically, it seems once you get a virus, any bodily function should be able to spread it. Why do viruses behave the way they do?

Thanks in advance for your time.

Text: **TL;DR:**
A year ago, we did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/m5i6g5/askscience_ama_series_hi_reddit_we_are_group_of/) answering science or technology questions on any topic from Reddit. We had a blast and so we're back again! So please ask us any questions any of you have to do with science or technology and how they affect your life. There are no silly questions - ask us anything and we will try to give an easy-to-understand answer and, wherever possible, provide some further sources to enable you to do your own research/reading.


Our goal is simply to advance everyone's understanding of science, engineering, and technology and to help people be better informed about the issues likely to affect them and their families.

**More info / Longer read:**
CSES is a registered charity in the UK, founded in 1920. We're a volunteer group of over 250 members and our key strength is our diversity and interdisciplinary expertise. Our members come from a variety of educational, social, and economic backgrounds, from industry and academia and a multitude of age groups, representing groups from the millennials all the way to the Silent Generation (our oldest member being 98)!

There has been growing dis-information globally in the last 20 years. Today's global interconnectedness, while being hugely beneficial for making information easily accessible to everyone, has made it ever more difficult to determine 'truth' and who to trust. As an independent charity, not affiliated or biased to any particular group, but with broad knowledge we are here to answer any questions you may have and to hopefully point you to further reading!

Our goal is simply to answer as many of your questions as we can - but we aren't able to give advice on things - sorry! We will also be clear where what we are saying is the experience-based opinion of someone in our team.

So, Reddit... Ask us anything!

CSES will draw from its large pool of volunteers to answer your questions, however some of the people standing by to answer comments are:

+ **Professor David Humber**: Over 30 years' experience as a researcher, lecturer and senior university manager, specialising in immuno-biology and the life sciences.
+ **David Whyte BEM**: Technologist and Chartered Engineer with over 10 years' R&amp;D experience and 16 international patents across a wide range of technologies. Honoured by The Queen with a BEM, for services to engineering and technology.
+ **Amy Knight**: Science teacher and artist experienced in art/science collaborations with organisations like Soapbox Science and The Royal Society; her work has been featured at the Tate Modern's &quot;Tate Exchange&quot;.
+ **Anthony McQuiggan**: 10 years of engineering experience and 30 years as a serial entrepreneur having built a number of very successful start-up SME technology companies in the UK, Japan, and the USA.
+ **Roger Pittock**: Active retired engineer with 37 years' experience in electronics, software, mechanical, electrical, process, and safety systems. Avid supporter of the Consumers' Association having been elected to their Council for many years.
+ **Adam Wood - President of CSES**: Chartered Engineer with over 13 years' experience in electronics, software, and systems engineering - working in the medical / healthcare, transport, and aerospace industries.

In particular if it happens to children or young adults still in the progress of growing, which i figure would be more sensitive to changes in intake(?), and therefore prevent them from reaching their full &quot;potential&quot;. 

Are there any data indicating that, e.g. &quot;population group X experienced economic difficulties in the year Y, which was reflected in a statistically detectable deviation/anomaly in the distribution for height for the group some N years later, compared to how it is normally&quot;

But that doesn't make the intensities at other wavelengths zero... They are there, non zero but small... I suspect they appear due to scattering from no so tightly bounded electrons. 

But my question is why should they be so low? Like why is the concentration of free electron scattering and tight electron scattering so high compared to the rest(the no so tight electron scattering)...?

One of these is the unfolding argument. Can't seem to find any literature on how Zekis´ theory of the disunity of consciousness relates to this argument. He provides no function for consciousness, is he therefore subject to the unfolding argument, and could be considered a casual structure theory such as Lammes´ recurrent processing theory (2006) and Tononis´ information integration theory (2004)?

I am just confused how tartaric acid is diprotic since it contains four hydroxides in its molecular structure; does this mean that only two of its hydroxides are reactive?  Maybe it means that after two protons have been donated, the structure changes to where it is no longer able to donate protons?  Any insight is appreciated, thank you.

Text: I need to settle a debate with someone. To be clear, we are talking about your average, everyday pendulum like you'd find in a clock or by tying a washer to the end of a string, standing on earth. 

From what I've always learned, the equation T = 2π√(L/g) defines the period of a pendulum. Neither the mass of the bob nor the amplitude have any affect on the period of the pendulum, only the length of said pendulum can change the amplitude.

This person whom I'm debating is stating that with a &quot;huge change in amplitude&quot; (but didn't specify what &quot;huge change&quot; meant) the period will change. As I understand it, acceleration increases proportionally with amplitude and therefore the two cancel each other out.

When I brought that up, they said, &quot;an elliptic integral usually approximated with a series far too long for me to get into.&quot; and gave no other explanation. I have never studied this. I've asked for an explanation, but he's gone dark other than to say, &quot;it's too complicated to get into.&quot; 

So, can a &quot;huge&quot; change in amplitude change the period, and what exactly did he mean by the elliptical integral comment?

Text: What are the actual consequences for researchers performing a study without informed consent? I would think that being unable to actually publish that work would be a given, but can researchers be held criminally or civilly liable? Is this kind of liability different from something like a medical malpractice case in say a drug trial?

Edit: I apologize for some added confusion on my part. I need to make an edit here because I think I didn't word my question correctly. 

I mean what if I ( or anyone else's) had participated in a study where proper consent was not given because of some kind of error on the part of the researchers. Like someone gave their consent, but it wasn't properly informed consent because of something like an omission of the risks, or failing to outline the responsibilities of the subject.

Text: In the UK, Network Rail explained why the UK rail infrastructure is unable to cope with hot temperatures, however, it also said that 'If we stressed our rails for exceptionally hot weather, they wouldn’t be safe for the winter and we’d have broken rail because it’s too cold.' 

What I'd like to understand is how the rail infrastructure in places that do experience extreme sides of weather is able to withstand the extremes. In my head I'm thinking of cities in North America on the east coast which experience very low and very high temperatures. How does their rail infrastructure cope with extremes? How are they built differently?

Text: In trying to research potential treatments for glioblastoma, I came across cannabinoids.  It seems like they all fight cancer (glioblastoma specifically) and could inevitably some day cure people's cancers.  There have been hundreds of studies, but as near as I can tell there has never once been a single study that tested these in live humans, without being administered in combination with chemo and radiation.  I heard a long time ago that they will never ever do that because if a person dies then someone gets blamed for not using chemo and radiation.  That kind of logic seems designed to forever prevent there from being any kind of cure or alternative to chemo and radiation, ever.

Do they ever do any in vivo studies on any (new or existing) cancer drugs that are not designed to see if the drug can &quot;assist&quot; chemo and radiation?  If not, is there any &quot;path forward&quot; for anyone to ever develop a drug that actually cures cancer?

Text: Keeping aquariums, including crawfish, shrimp, and crabs, I have obviously noticed that crawfish visually look a lot more like a shrimp than the average crab. In fact, at the store I work at, it takes a trained eye to distinguish between young crawfish and shrimp. I am assuming much of this applies to young lobsters as well, though all the ones I’ve seen have more distinguishable claws from an early age.

Anyways, I am trying to understand oceanic evolution through time and I’ve read that decapoda evolved into reptantia (lobsters and crabs) and natantia (shrimp). Does this suggest that lobsters are more closely related to crabs than shrimp, or am I misunderstanding something?

This region seems to really stand out in this graph from UNAIDS. Over the last decade, the only other region with a rise in incidence was Middle East And North Africa, but it was only a 7% increase, vs +43% in Eastern Europe And Central Asia.     



[https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media\_asset/2021-global-aids-update\_en.pdf](https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/2021-global-aids-update_en.pdf)

I gathered from this document by UNAIDS that the major disease burden in this region is on IV drug users, and the main hurdles to controlling the disease are punitive laws and social stigma (p.336, 338). But why is this region handling the disease so much worse than other regions, specifically Middle East And North Africa?           

It seems that these 2 regions have similarly oppressive political climate and legislature (Table 18.2 &amp; 19.2). The minorities also appears to be similarly marginalized. And according to the document, Eastern Europe And Central Asia had more resources available than Middle East And North Africa did (\~40% vs 20% of the resource needed for achieving 2025 goals) (Fig. 18.10 &amp; 19.6).      



I understand that this is probably a complicated issue with a myriad of factors at play. And I must admit that I do not know much about the political and cultural situation of these regions. To sum up, my question is: 

&gt;What are the major impetus to the remarkably worse HIV control in Eastern Europe And Central Asia, as compared to Middle East And North Africa, despite having a seemingly similar socio-political environment and higher resource availability?

Just wanted to get feedback from actual geneticists on that claim, as it is expounded more or less in this paper: [https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00361](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00361). I think this sounds like a load of eugenic bullshit (and that the idea of a co-ocurrence of a dysgenic trend with the Flynn effect is methodologically unsound), but I don't think I have enough knowledge of the subject to actually assert so. 

Is this a fringe theory, or is there any support for it in current genetic studies?

Text: I noticed today that when using two different brands of synthetic fertilizers with almost identical NPK levels I was getting a significantly higher EC. the PK levels of one brand of nutrient were higher but I did that math for both nutrient companies in order to ensure I was using identical amounts of RAW NPK. I found that I needed to use significantly more nutrients from one brand to get the same levels of raw nitrogen phosphorus and potassium than the other. After adding the nutrients of the &quot;low quality&quot; brand I noticed the EC was significantly higher (2.3) than the &quot;higher quality&quot; nutrients (1.9) but I'm still adding the same amount of RAW NPK to each tank. 
So my question is this, what exactly is causing the EC to be higher from one brand to the next, is it all the filler from using more nutrients to achieve the same NPK causing this? Or do cheaper/lower quality nutrients use more Iron boron calcium magnesium etc to synthesize their nutrients?

Text: So I've been trying to investigate these New Age claims that say our heart is basically an EMF transmitter but didn't find any convincing proof that this is actually true.

Obviously the heart operates through all sorts of phenomena, electricity being involved as well. Where there is current, there are electromagnetic fields. So it's obvious that SOME field could be detected if we would have a sensitive enough device.

But the problem is their claims seem especially outlandish. The research linked below argues that this EMF can even be detected several feet away, which sounds a bit crazy. If the heart would've had such a strong EMF, it would've been more common knowledge in our society. I mean, maybe they are kind of right. After all, they aren't mentioning any concrete values, they just say it's 100 times stronger than the brain's field (which I also doubt).

[https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-hearts-magnetic-field-which-is-the-strongest-rhythmic-field-produced-by-the-human\_fig11\_293944391](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-hearts-magnetic-field-which-is-the-strongest-rhythmic-field-produced-by-the-human_fig11_293944391)

I first heard about this claim here: [https://youtu.be/ta4w28IlzPE?t=1410](https://youtu.be/ta4w28IlzPE?t=1410)

This man named Joe Dispenza was making a lot of sense up to the timestamp I've selected.  
When he said the heart produces something similar to a WiFi signal, 3 meters wide, that's when my &quot;quack alarm&quot; started going off.

What's your opinion? Is all of this pseudoscience or is there any truth to it?  
Do you have any research to back up these claims?

Edit: For clarity, by &quot;animal in every-day talk&quot; I just mean no single celled organisms, bacteria, etc. Things that are just so obviously far from us because they're so simple. Things like insects, sponges, etc all count. I eliminate them simply because while most likely correct, it's just not an interesting answer, and most people not in the scientific field wouldn't consider a bacteria to even be an animal in any way. For the sake of what discussion can be drawn from this, I want more interesting answers than the very obvious.

My thought is more inclined to the tanning oil refracting light like how immersion oil in light microscopy would refract light, but what does that have to do with the refractive index of skin?

The other explanation is in the moisturizing property of the oil sustaining the substrate accumulation for the melanocytes.

Text: I have messed around quite a bit electrolyzing materials in order to generate hydrogen, oxygen and chlorine. I had very limited means and it was just a hobby project, but a consistent problem I had and I saw others having on the internet is the corrosion of the anode. Even stainless steel or graphite could not stand the test of time and I can imagine platinum electrodes are prohibitively expensive for industrial scale. Other options such as Mixed-metal-oxide seems too expensive for gigawatt scale production as well. Most hydrogen manufacturing websites only mention marketing buzzwords (&quot;ultra high density&quot; / &quot;innovative corrosion resistance&quot;) and no technical details. Perhaps it's all a bit of a trade secret, but I am quite curious!  


Sidenote, I can imagine it getting messed up when messing with NaCl electrolysis with chlorine and carbon steel electrodes. But if I recall correctly even NaOH solutions with stainless corroded after some time. So my question focusses specifically on hydrogen production.

Text: Hey there

In general, stars are moving away from us and, in combination with the doppler effect, this gives us redshift. When we look at stars with our eyes, they look more red than they actually are. When a picture is taken, the star looks more red than it actually is. This leads to two ways to represent a star in a picture (like [this one](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NXmL6bbh7QMA3xxfuu56uZ.png)):

1. The way a star looks for a human on earth (non-colour corrected for redshift)
2. The way a star *actually* looks (colour corrected for redshift). It would display the colour of a star like the star actually sends out.

And so rises my question: are pictures of stars colour-corrected for redshift? Do the pictures display a star like a human would see it, or how it looks in reality (as if you were right next to it)?

For example, in the picture linked above, the star at the centre is just a white spot. But let's take the orange star to the left bottom of the middle. Is it actually that red (colour-corrected)? Or does it look that red because of red shift (not colour-corrected)?

In school, in dutch, I learned the term &quot;Emission spectrum&quot; of a star (almost always hydrogen is used). I think the official english term is RVS? You can use that and the default (&quot;recorded&quot; on earth) to calculate the amount of redshift. If you know how much redshift there is, you can colour-correct a picture for redshift. So if you supply a picture of a star and it's RVS, you can do some calculations and color-correct a picture. However, when searching the web, I didn't find a single &quot;tool&quot; that could do this. Why isn't there any?

I just had this topic in physics class at school and I came up with these questions after his lesson and my teacher didn't know the answer, so here I am, asking it to you people. I hope you can shed some light!

If not, is the process of how they got there understood?  If so, does that imply that life on earth used to be more adapted to elevated levels of heavy metals?

After all, it's more better in a lot ways than carbon fiber, especially in cost. Like, you can make your own graphene at home-type cheap. 

BAC motors made a sports car that has graphene body panels, probably using graphene in its' fiber form, that's what I think is most likely how they used it.

I've learned that it is strongly recommended to replace plastic when it comes to food containers. However, I have a few questions about the use of plastics in every day life that I have found opposing answers for when searching and I'd appreciate your take on:

1. Are plastic containers relatively safe (with or without BPA) as long as they're not used to heat up food? Is not using them for storing food in the fridge or at room temperature still highly recommended or are the risks exaggerated?
2. Do plastic containers/trays/storage bins (with or without BPA) for clothes, personal items, and paper pose similar risks? Should plastic be avoided to store and organize items in desks, closets, shelfs, etc, too?
3. Do the risks of doing 1 and 2 increase for a person with actual hormone problems?

Text: What I know is that the Poincaire group is characterised by, like, 9-10 commutation relations. And every field, before quantisation, is a vector space on which there must be representations of the Poincaire group defined as operators.

For instance, the operator e^(xd/dy-y/d/dx) is a representation of a member belonging to this group, and this operator acts on the vector space of fields, causing to rotate them. e^(d/dx) is another member of this group. Another member would be the exponentiation of Pauli matrices. Those don't operate on infinite dimensional fields, but rather on 2- component objects. Another member of this group could be 4x4 Lorentz transformations, which operate on 4 vectors. Bottom line : **every field that we quantise must have operators of this group defined on them.**

About SU1xSU2xSU3, I know that these are used as gauge groups. But idk much more than that. 

Have I understood them right? And **is there any connection between what these two groups have to do with physics?** Or are just important but independent ideas?

Text: I saw a bunch of studies and assertions that it ruins REM sleep. But I also saw stuff that says it's a miracle for sleep and anxiety and nightmares. These things don't seem to coalesce into one pattern; if it helps with anxiety, then it can't also not let you get real rest, becuase over time you would get worse anxiety from not being able to sleep. Bad sleep=more anxiety. Ditto nightmares, if you can't get real rest, then you get more nightmares. 

So what's going on? Is the data conflicting, does it matter who's being studied and why they're taking the drug, does it matter what particular type of thing they're taking, what ingestion method?

Text: I don't know a huge amount about testosterone supplementation or hyperandrogenism, but I do know that hyperandrogenism in females is usually associated with an increased risk of diabetes, obesity, and insulin resistance. 

However, as far as I can tell, those risks are not increased in the case of people, female or otherwise, taking testosterone intentionally. (For example, transgender men who use HRT, or bodybuilders who use steroids that increase testosterone.)

Why is that? Does it have something to do with the conditions that naturally cause hyperandrogenism?

Text: Is it balanced so perfectly that the oxygen released by the plants is utilised by microorganisms that in turn provide carbon dioxide and nitrogen/waste, which feeds the plants and the cycle restarts? I'd just imagine there being some offset that causes gas accumulation eventually causing the glass jar to explode. 

Especially when the animals within, snails and such, piggybacking on the plants I introduce, begin to breed? 

Similarly to when I did sauerkraut that one time and didn't provide a release valve 😅

I know depleted uranium has less [uranium-235](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium-235) than [natural uranium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_uranium), since said U-235 has been refined out and used in a nuclear reactor or weapon, but I don't know what all the [uranium-238](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium-238) left over has bonded to.

So, if spending time in green space is something we seem to need to thrive, what about the stars themselves? A big percentage of people have never seen the Milky Way at night because it's too bright at night now. I know people who didn't know it was something you could see with the naked eye, and had almost spiritual experiences seeing a proper night sky. Maybe it's a silly question, or maybe impossible to really study separately from the impact of artificial light in general. But I am curious if anyone has looked into whether the lack of stars at night has any effects on our health?

My impression was that each shot remains effective for around 6 months. For myself and others I know under 50, we're well past that point.

Text: If I take a big strong spring and compress it between my arms, it takes a continuous amount of energy for me to hold it there.

However if I put that same spring in a vice and use some of my energy to close the vice, it'll happily sit there closed without me needing to add extra energy to the vice.

What's the difference here? Why do I seemingly need an infinite amount of energy to hold the spring closed but the vice doesn't? Where is that energy from me going?

Text:  

If we have a population of normal and cancer cells, and we give a drug to this population. And lets say this drug induces apoptosis. Usually, the drug would have a detrimental effects on the cancerous cells, but would pretty much cause the normal cells to be unaffected. How is that? If the drug can induce cell death in both normal and cancerous cells, why do the cancerous cells tend to die first? Is it because cancerous cells are way better at metabolism than non-cancerous cells, and so they suck everything from their environment; Therefore the normal cells get a small quantity of the drug, while the cancerous cells consume most of it and hence die?

(I know that some drugs might target  molecules that are unique to cancerous cells. However for the ones that are non-specific, how do these drugs manage to destroy our cancerous cells pretty well, while sort of not over-harming our normal cells)

Text: My understanding of math/physics is formally at an undergraduate level, so I apologize in advance if my questions are confusing or not very well formulated.

I've watched some videos about the holographic principle and how it was the attempts to solve the so-called black hole information paradox that lead to the development of string theories and the holographic principle. Ultimately this culminates in the correspondence between Anti-de Sitter spaces (a model of the universe under general relativity) and conformal field theories (i.e., quantum field theories). In the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klpDHn8viX8), the presenter tells us two things: 1.) That this correspondence leads to a &quot;natural&quot; theory of quantum gravity, and 2.) that interactions (between quantum particles?) on the boundary of the mathematical object's surface correspond to the emergence of gravity within the volume. However, he tells us that this isn't applicable to *our* universe, because anti-de Sitter spaces assume a negative curvature on the space-time metric, while as far as I understand, in reality it is zero (i.e., a Minkowski space-time).

So my questions are twofold: what quantum information is the problem here, and in need of conservation; are they things like spins and energies, and why does this lead to the holographic principle? Secondly, what is being said about the actual physics going on between quantum field theories and gravity with regards to this strange mathematical object?

Text: There are multiple arcs of light spreading from many of the galaxies shown in the deep field image from the James Webb Telescope. From googling I'm understanding that these arcs are generally the result of gravitational lensing caused by a mass outside the focus of the image. My specific question stems from the multiple arcs that aren't concentric.

I've worked to the perhaps invalid understanding that each non-concentric arc must represent a different lense (gravitational mass) How is a single perspective (the telescope) able to focus the light from multiple lenses at once?

I'm imagining that it's possible that we and chimpanzees share some junk DNA that's been hanging out since our ancestors diverged a relatively short time ago. Is this true?

Text: So I tried to find some information on this topic, especially the difference between medical reactions observed between male and female (Biological not Gender), and how transitioning can change reactions to treatment.

What I found was [this](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2009/1201/p1254.html#:~:text=Pharmacodynamic%20differences%20in%20women%20include,experience%20an%20adverse%20drug%20reaction) &quot; Pharmacodynamic differences in women include **greater sensitivity to and enhanced effectiveness of beta blockers, opioids, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and typical antipsychotics**. Additionally, women are 50 to 75 percent more likely than men to experience an adverse drug reaction. &quot;

**So my question is, does transitioning with hormones (lets say a Transwoman/ Male to Female) have an effect on how the body reacts to medical treatment?** 

Also other interesting things I would like to know regarding that topic, are there differences in blood values between male and female, and how do transpeople get evaluated with that in mind.

&amp;#x200B;

(I would greatly apreciate it if you could also link studies if they exist, I tried to find studies, but couldnt find any and I dont know how to find them if they exist. I know that it could probably be a topic that is not well researched).

Text: White paint is commonly used on aircraft for practical and economic reasons - it's easier to resell a white plane that can be painted with the buyer's livery, its easier to spot leaks, the plane heats up less while sitting on the tarmac and most importantly, white paint will not fade or flake as quickly as other colours since it reflects light rather than absorbing it.

However this got me thinking, is there any strong evidence that the reflective nature of white paint used on airliners helps combat exposure to UV-A, B or ionizing radiation for the occupants?

Text: Consider the potential due to a pure dipole... It's 
V=k(p.r)/|r|^3 ... where r is position vector of the point at which the potential is considered and p is dipole moment of the charge distribution... 

Because the net charge Q=0, p remains the same even if we shift the origin... Now consider shifting the origin such that |r| remains the same but r doesn't so that p.r has a different value now... Therefore V has a different value in this frame...

Why? Isn't the potential at a point just the potential difference between this point and a chosen reference point(which happens to be infinity in this case) which shouldn't change unless you change the reference point itself? 

Any explanation???

Text: I am teaching myself about the processes by which penile tumescence occurs and is maintained.  I have found that part of the process of Ca^2+ sensitization that occurs in cavernosal smooth muscle cells is by the action of Src tyrosine kinases acting on BK(Ca) receptors by phosphorylating the alpha subunits.

However, what I don't understand is how exactly that phosphorylation winds up affecting the calcium levels?  Does it activate the ion gate?  Does it hyperpolarize the surrounding membrane?  Are other chemicals like cAMP or DAG involved? I am not a biochemist and I am but a humble physicist.  The publications on the matter seem to overlook this little detail as prerequisite material, so I'm at a bit of a loss.  I see how this works in Na ion channels as well as in vascular smooth muscle cells, but those seem to be operating by a different mechanism.

Text: I just got done watching a video about Parting of the Waters in Moran, WY. There is a unique feature here in which a creek running along the continental divide splits and half runs to the Pacific while the other half runs to the Atlantic. The title of the video is &quot;The Creek that Flows to Two Different Oceans&quot; if anyone wants to check it out for more context.

Anyway, it got me thinking: Assuming no evaporation, absorption into the soil, or any other means of exiting the continuous flow, how long would it take a drop of water to flow from that location all the way to the Atlantic Ocean?

There are overlapping issues like estimating actual path lengths of the creeks and rivers, different flow rates that depend on precipitation and water levels, fluid dynamics, and I'm sure a bunch other stuff I'm not even thinking of. Seems like such a cool multi-disciplinary problem. Is it possible to simplify it enough to get a rough answer? I'd love to hear everyone's take!

If there are thousands of (even extremely distant) galaxies at every point in the sky (when viewed from Earth), why is the night sky dark in so many places? It seems like it could be bright almost everywhere -  is it just that some are so much closer &amp; brighter, so it looks that way?

Text: (I didn't get any answers on r/loseit and a mod on r/nutrition recommended to post this here)

I'm not going to quote any sources but correct me if I get anything wrong. I did some googling and reading on Reddit, and heard that when you grow up obese, your body makes more fat cells to store fat and that number gets locked in after adolescence, or they won't be made except under extreme circumstances afterwards. Also that generally childhood obesity makes the body have a tendency / more &quot;biologically wired&quot; to store fat or more fat.

Let's say I have person A and person B. A had childhood obesity while B didn't, and both have the same stats that would be put in a TDEE calculator like [this one](https://www.freedieting.com/calorie-calculator) (sex, age, physical activity, etc.) except for weight, but if they enter in the same weight, both would get the same TDEE Result. If they both ate, let's say 2000 calories a day, would person A weight noticeably more, or they weigh about the same (and any difference would just be the result of being 2 different people)?

The Wikipedia article is somewhat unclear and could use some revision, or at least more explanation in this regard.
