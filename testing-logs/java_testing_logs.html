Text: Whether they are trying to level something like the equivalent to hanging a picture frame in space or a nondescript surface, how would they go about it?



Surely a situation where astronauts need to level something has occurred, I just can't think of an exact scenario due to lack of knowledge, nor can I find anything online. I know most levels require gravity in order to work. And then it also depends on what they truly define &quot;level&quot; as--is something level when it is perpendicular to the force of gravity and/or just parallel to another object? Could they use several gyroscopes and simulate &quot;gravity&quot; and creating something like an x and y axis?



Or is &quot;level&quot; simply not a property in space? And how do they deal with this?

Text: Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Physics, Astronomy, Earth and Planetary Science**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for 'X' were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;.

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed.

Given that 1) fire needs oxygen to burn an object and 2) there would not be any oxygen inside of a blob of lava.

What would happen if you quickly encapsulated a chunk of wood inside a blob of red hot lava? Can it burn without oxygen? Would it just get so hot that it turns straight into carbon or something???

Text: I heard that asteroids or dwarf planets can sometimes get &quot;caught&quot; by larger planets and become moons. But if the intuitions of orbital mechanics I got from playing Kerbal Space Program are correct, there's no way of approaching a body such that you immediately get an orbit. You can only get a fly-by and then reduce that into an orbit by accelerating retrograde.

It also seems like it should violate time reversibility of classical physics. Imagine if an asteroid fell towards a planet with the right angle and velocity to get a stable elliptical orbit and then completes 5 laps around it. If we now suddenly and perfectly reversed its velocity, the asteroid should trace back the way it came from, right? So would it move back along the same ellipse 5 times in the opposite direction before suddenly being flung out into space, despite no other forces acting on it?

It seems to me that if orbital mechanics are time-reversible, then if they are stable forwards in time, they must also be stable backwards in time. So how can stable orbits be created through mere encounters?

Text: So I just got into a huge argument with my boss, a MD at a cancer hospital in a developing country regarding hpv and cervical cancer. 

Allow me to paint the picture: we are working on a grant submission on communicable diseases. The focus is hpv prevention but she wants to focus on cervical cancer, bu I’m adamant that the grantor won’t even review our submission if it’s on cervical cancer. She says to just trust her and don’t argue with her because she’ll escalate it to the medical director and get me fired.

She claims that hpv is the same as cervical cancer as hpv is the major risk factor in 80% to 99.7% of all cases of cervical cancer. My argument is that they’re not the same. Preventing hpv through vaccination and educating patients on safe sex and contraceptive use is not the same as preventing cervical cancer. CDC says that it’s the major risk factor, but hpv infection does not mean a person has cervical cancer. I said that correlation does does mean causation and she says yes it does.

So here I am, on my last straw, on reddit at 6 am asking scientists: is hpv the same as cervical cancer?

I’ve been going back and forth on how to simulate an electromagnetic “ray” and got stuck on whether or not I need to account for both Doppler shift and phase changes due to spacial variation (k=2pi/lambda), or just one.

I’m convinced you only need one or the other since they are derived from one another but was told this isn’t the case and need to account for both?

Ie:  
signal = exp(i(2pi*(fc+fd)t)) vs 
signal = exp(i(2pi*(fc+fd)t-kd))


Would anyone be able to explain why both are needed even though the Doppler shift is derived from the wave number?

But I saw this article yesterday:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2024/02/01/why-women-have-more-autoimmune-diseases/

It mentions that overwhelmingly, research is done on men, which I’ve heard. So they only just now are discovering a potential cause of a huge health issue that predominantly affects women.

And it got me thinking - surely we could involve more of us gals in research by selecting menopausal women, prepubescent girls, maybe even avowed celibate women.

I’m sure it would be limited to an extent because of that sample size, but surely it would make a significant difference in understanding our unique health challenges, right? I mean, I was a girl, then an adult woman who never got pregnant, then a post-menopausal woman… any research that could have helped me could have been invaluable.

Are there other barriers preventing studying women’s health that I’m not aware of? Particularly ones that don’t involve testing medication. Is it purely that we might get a bun in the oven? 

Edit: thanks so much for the very detailed and thought provoking responses. I look forward to reading all of your links and diving in further. Much appreciate everyone who took time to respond! And please, keep them coming!

Text: When we breathe, we use the oxygen of the air to oxydize our body sugar or fat to produce energy (via ATP molecules). Water and carbon dioxyde (CO2) are by-products of these reactions. ATP is used by our muscles to move. Water is easily recycled within our body and we finally exhale the CO2. So O2 in, energy and water in the middle and CO2 out.

Now, we don't inhale oxygen, we inhale air which is roughly made of 80% nitrogen, 20% oxygen and a few other molecules in very little quantities. So does our body handle or process the nitrogen in the air, and if so, how ?

Text: I never really thought about it but I am finding it hard to believe that a surrogate baby has nothing passed down to it from the carrying mother. Isn’t all the nutrition and whatever will “make up” the baby passing through the carrying mother first? Does that not affect how the baby gets made?  I’m sure I just have a fundamental misunderstanding but I’d like to know what that is.

Text: There was a question on here years ago asking about the caloric content of an egg vs a chick, but I’m wondering how a chick manages that massive amount of cell division on just 70 calories. Incubation is 20 days so theyre only using 3.5 calories per day on average.

I’m aware they’re kept warm but that just means they dont have to heat themselves. that energy can’t be used for division which is the main thing I’m curious about.

Text: For example, since according to relativity there is no preferred reference frame, to a neutrino moving at 99% c towards me, it could look like I am actually moving at 99% c towards it. But in the latter reference frame, I'm an object dozens of orders of magnitude more massive than the neutrino moving near the speed of light, so I should have an absolutely absurd amount of kinetic energy. Now imagine I bump into another person, or even just move through air particles; at such a speed, the resulting collision should be equivalent to detonating several nuclear weapons. Basically, the question becomes, doesn't the fact that we are not constantly exploding all the time imply that there is a preferred frame of reference, in this case the one in which the neutrino is moving at relativistic speed and I am not?

Text: I'm a junior chemistry major but I still haven't really had this explained.

The curve in an absorbance spectra, as opposed a straight line at an exact frequency, can be explained by the doppler effect. If light is absorbed in an orbital at X frequency and you shoot light with a frequency of 0.95 X at the orbital, if the molecule is moving towards the light source at a certain speed, the doppler effect will increase the effective frequency to X from the perspective. Works similarly if you shoot light with a frequency of 1.05 X and the molecule is moving away.

There's uncertainty in every measurement. When you measure a liter of water, you can say a liter, or be more precise, say 1.0 liters, and then 1.02 liters, 1.018 liters, etc. You can always get more and more precise. How do we deal with precision in the energy difference between electron configurations? The frequency of light needed to excite an electron configuration from the ground state to an excited state is in a molecule is often given in eV. If there's a difference of 3.21 eV between two configurations, and the light hitting the orbital has an energy of 3.21 eV, the orbital will absorb the energy and become excited. What if the difference between the configurations was really 3.214 eV, and it was hit by light with an energy of 3.213 eV? Would it still be absorbed? When is the difference too much?

Text: Delta IV and Delta IV Heavy sets itself on fire right before takeoff. This is expected behaviour and looks alarming but it's OK, they know it's going to happen and they've made sure the flames won't damage anything. 

The usual explanation is that Delta IV runs hydrogen through the engines early on. The rocket has liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen on board and they don't want excess oxygen to build up in the engines because oxygen is very chemically reactive and could damage the engine. So they run excess hydrogen through the rocket, especially early on. This hydrogen burns in a dramatic looking (but not actually very dangerous) fireball.

But then why don't other rockets set themselves on fire? The Shuttle, Ariane 5, Japan's H-II and China's Long March 5 are all using hydrogen on their first stages but don't set themselves on fire. I get that rockets using kerosene won't have the same fireball issue but why don't all hydrogen fueled rockets have a fireball? 

I feel like it's been explained a hundred times but with only half an explanation. What does Ariane 5 do differently to Delta IV that means one has a fireball and the other doesn't?

If a magnetic field is needed to induce electricity and electricity is needed to have a magnetic field, which one comes first? The earth’s outer core is liquid molten metal and has convection currents which generate electricity with the help of an already established magnetic field? Or is it established mini magnetic fields within the core due to the convection currents or would that be the same thing? If there’s an electrical current there’s always a magnetic field. How does a magnetic field already exist to create an electrical current and needs an electrical current to exist I’m not even sure I know what I’m confused about here someone help! Is it like nuclear fusion in that it “helps itself” using its own process? Also can someone help me apply this to electronics and electrical systems?

Text: When there is an error during meiosis (during the disjunction of homologous chromosomes or during the disjunction of sister chromatids), we end up with 1/2 gametes with n+1 chromosomes and 1/2 gametes with n-1 chromosomes. We know that the fertilization of an egg cell with n+1 chromosomes with a normal male cell is the cause of Down Syndrome, where an individual has 2n+1 chromosomes. But what about the n-1 egg cells? Are they all polar bodies, or is it possible that an individual can be born with 2n-1 chromosomes (even if they can't survive)?

Text: As I was driving home from vacation, I drove through a windmill farm as I do every time I drive this way… I got to thinking after staring at them…

There are HUNDREDS of windmills in this one farm, yet only a fraction of them are actually rotating. Why? Why can’t the blades all be in the “on” position and just generate electricity as wind permits?

What/who (I imagine wind patterns and some engineer or AI software) decides which windmills are on? Being there are so many windmills, they’re all slightly varied angles, but there are many examples of two windmills facing the exact same direction, immediately next to each other, and one is on, one is off. Why?!

I must know why windmills are so mystifying!
Thank you!

Text: For example, looking up, raccoons are one of the most common animals infected with rabies, but, looking even further, this is mostly located on the East Coast. In my state, Illinois, raccoons (and other terrestrial animals, for that matter) are \*\*VERY\*\* rarely infected with rabies, the vast majority of rabies cases are bats. 

I should say, looking up, I discovered this is, I imagine, due to rabies variants, but, my  question is, why does one rabies variant seem to so rarely affect other animals, meanwhile humans seem to easily acquire rabies from so many different species? Are we humans just especially susceptible to many more variants of rabies than other animals are? To say it a different way, why isn't it common for a raccoon in Illinois to be bitten by a rabies infect bat, then pass that rabies on to another raccoon and-so-on? Do these other animals have resistances to certain variants of rabies that humans lack?

Text: We don't see Dinosaur fossils in the record after the K-P Mass Extinction Event from the Asteroid; however, it is suggested that Non-Avian Dinosaurs dropped like flies. I've heard the reason we don't have much fossil evidence or complete fossil evidence from stages before the K-P extinction event is because many animals were scavenged upon dispersing the bodies. So, with the rapid change in climate, mass die-off after the asteroid collision, and destruction of so many millions, if not billions of animals with very few larger non-avian dinosaurs to destroy the evidence then where are the fossils? Several billion organisms dying off in about a million years or less would certainly have a large footprint, wouldn't it?

Text: So this applies to multiple diseases, but the one in the news the most lately is obviously covid. For that reason, I'm using covid as the example, but the question goes for any disease.

After recovering from covid, it's estimated that a person has one month of near immunity, which tapers down to a mild resistance over the following two months, and then no resistance once three months have passed. (These figures may not be precise, but it's the concept that's important here.) While there's no guarantee, even in that first month, that you won't catch it again, it is less likely. So my question is:

If you were exposed on a weekly basis to covid, starting one week after recovering from having it... would it effectively refresh your period of heavy resistance? Assuming you didn't get unlucky and actually *catch* it any of the subsequent exposures, that is.

On top of this, HSV-1 can shed without symptoms, further increasing the risk that children and even adults unknowingly spread it across themselves. Why aren't these conditions more common (emphasis on the ocular and finger ones, as I can understand why genital HSV-1 is common due to oral sex in teens, though info on that would be cool too)?

So please ask us any questions any of you have to do with science or technology and how they affect your life. There are no silly questions - ask us anything and we will try to give an easy-to-understand answer and, wherever possible, provide some further sources to enable you to do your own research/reading.

Our goal is simply to advance everyone's understanding of science, engineering, and technology and to help people be better informed about the issues likely to affect them and their families.

CSES is a registered charity in the UK, founded in 1920. We're a volunteer group comprising over 250 members and our key strength is our diversity of thought and interdisciplinary expertise. Our members come from a variety of educational, social, and economic backgrounds, from industry and academia and a multitude of age groups, representing groups from the millennials all the way to the Silent Generation (our oldest member being nearly 100!)

There has been growing dis-information globally in the last 20 years. Today's global interconnectedness, while being hugely beneficial for making information easily accessible to everyone, has made it ever more difficult to determine 'truth' and who to trust. As an independent charity, not affiliated or biased to any particular group, but with broad knowledge we are here to answer any questions you may have and to hopefully point you to further reading!

Our goal is simply to answer as many of your questions as we can - but we aren't able to give advice on things - sorry! We will also be clear where what we are saying is the experience-based opinion of someone in our team.

So, Reddit... Ask us anything!




CSES will draw from its large pool of volunteers to answer your questions, however some of the people standing by to answer comments are:

+ Professor David Humber: 30 years' experience as a researcher, lecturer and senior university manager specialising in immuno-biology and the life sciences.
+ David Whyte: Technologist and Chartered Systems Engineer with 12 years' R&amp;D experience, and 17 international patents across a wide range of technologies. Honoured by The Queen for services to engineering and technology.

Text: Many people say &quot;oh the poor tree, don't cut it down&quot; even though it was planted for commercial use. So is there any correlation from the amount of CO2 a tree takes in to its age? Like at age x, the tree takes in y kg of CO2 per month or something like that. And if there is, can somebody point me in the right direction for a study or something like that?

Text: If you play a note of a certain frequency on a flute and simultaneously sing a note at a different frequency, then you create a third frequency that wouldn't be there if you play or sing in isolation - and the frequency of this subharmonic is the difference of the flute frequency and the voice frequency (I'm talking about the fundamental frequencies for simplicity). This is caused by modulation (product rule: cos(f1*x)cos(f2x) = 0.5*(cos(f1-f2)+cos(f1+f2)), which in turn suggests some nonlinearity in the system.

I made some observations about this effect:

1. It is not unique to flutes- works on any wind instrument (commonly known as Growling on saxophones)
2. It is NOT the Tartini tone / missing fundamental / difference tone. I know it might be tempting to classify it as such, but keep in mind that the Tartini tone is just in your head (caused by some nonlinearity in the hearing apparatus). The subharmonic mentioned here is clearly measurable on a spectrogram.
3. Whistling into the flute does not work. Sure, it produces a beat frequency (linear superposition) and a Tartini tone (illusion in your head), but the subharmonic is not visible on the spectrogram. This suggests to me that the nonlinearity that causes the modulation is somehow in the vocal chords. The problem might be somehow linked to coupled oscillators, but beyond me right now.

Do you have an intuitive explanation for this? Thanks!

Text: People can tell where a sensation is (arm vs leg vs back vs foot).

These signals travel to the spinal cord and to the brain.

How do these signals carry the location information of a sensation? For instance, is the signal that results from an electric shock to the arm different than the signal from an electric shock to the foot?

Additionally, there are a lot of other information carried to the brain as well such as pressure, texture , etc. 

Is this something science has figured out? Are there any current attempts to use ML to decode nerve signals?

If nerve signals are ever decoded, then the potential is massive. You can build devices that replicate sensations of certain things.

Text: I understand that we could (up until recently) communicate very slowly with Voyager I. I also understand that Voyager I's nuclear generator will stop working at some point (I've seen some reporting that the generator will stop working around 2025). Once Voyager is fully powered down or has broken to the point where it cannot communicate with us (which may be the case right now?), can we still track Voyager I with direct sensing? In other words, I understand that with astrophysical simulation we can estimate where Voyager is at any time in the future, but once Voyager can no longer transmit back to us, do we have any way of &quot;seeing&quot; voyager. In other words, are we able to aim a very powerful telescope at Voyager and see a reflection (or a transit of a star?). Could we aim a laser at Voyager and confirm that Voyager is where we thought it was by the reflection of the laser?  In other words, once Voyager I stops transmitting to us, would we have any way of knowing that it still exists (as opposed to, say, crashing into a rogue asteroid)?

Text: Just had my first extremely disgusting experience dealing with a tapeworm infestation in my cat. The cat is dewormed and fine, but I learned that the specific type of tapeworm he caught (a Taenia species) sheds eggs that must be ingested by an intermediate host (usually rodents) where it develops into a sort of cyst that can infect cats if they eat the mouse or whatever. The vet and every source online I have found all agree that direct cat to cat infection is basically impossible, but none explain why.

My question is why does the worm need the intermediate host? The mouse and the cat are both mammals with basically the same anatomy (or so I assume as a layperson) so why would it not just go straight to the cat and skip the middle step?

Text: To start this out; when asking &quot;How effective are masks?&quot; this is in reference to actual data, like numbers, diagrams, charts, tests, etc. How effective masks are during prolonged usage, range, etc. How well do they protect from/stop germs/particles.

Not looking for any personal preferences, political/religious views, medical aspects or anything like that, purely data. Also not just asking about how (in)effective masks are against Covid-19, but in general, such as for sicknesses, smoke (Like in China), any other use. Wearing one, or others wearing one. Surgical, Cloth, Woven, etc. 

If you're providing any information to link to the research paper, article, website, etc. If this has been asked before please link it, but more recent data is preferred.

Text: I think I understand (at high level) the El Niño phenomenon: usually pacific winds blow east-to-west, and this &quot;pushes&quot; warm surface waters to the west. As a consequence, surface water is cooler in eastern Pacific than in western Pacific. When El Niño occurs, these winds weaken or reverse and the surface water gets warmer in the East (central and south America) and this of course has major consequences in these regions.

What I don't get, though, is that at a global (Earth) level, the western pacific water would get cooler during El Niño, and at this global level both effects (warning in the east and cooling in the west) would sum up to zero, hence, there would be no global effect, only local ones.

From what I hear or read, it seems that this reasoning is wrong and that there would be a global warming effect of El Niño

Am I missing or misunderstanding something ?

Even if a boar, or whatever, could feed a village/tribe on its meat alone, that is only going to stay good for consumption for so long and has its own risks for hunting it.

I’m seriously amazed we as a species managed to survive in the wilderness with our caloric requirements, assuming there wasn’t a massive shift in those between early humans and now.

If this estimation is based on our current/recent frame of reference, some other being on some other planet should just as easily say age of the universe is around 100 years and we should both be correct. Which should mean trying to calculate age of the universe is not really useful or meaningful?

Adding to that, suppose someone go back 6 billion years in time and try to calculate age of the universe. Wouldn't their frame of reference be much more different than ours? So, would they come up with an age of around 8 billion years?

People cannot physically process all of the calories they eat. This got carried away and I claimed that if you ate a pill that had 100,000 calories (please ignore that this is pretty impossible but it’s a hypothetical so the possibility of it is unrelated), you would absorb some of it, and poop out the rest of it, as you can only digest a certain amount of calories per hour, and the pill will stay in your digestive track for a certain amount of time, as it moves down at around a constant speed (I think). He says that you would die from your body trying to absorb too many calories, but I think this wouldn’t be possible as you would just poop out whatever you don’t absorb, as if you could just absorb 100,000 calories in an hour, it wouldn’t make sense as how would you have enough energy to do so.

Text: In chlorine neutrino detectors, whenever a neutrino interacts with one of the chlorine atoms, that one atom changes to Argon.

This is atomic number 17 gaining a proton and becoming atomic number 18.

If the neutrino is millions of times smaller than the nucleus, how does this tiny interaction actually make that atom gain a new proton?

It doesn't make much sense to me. I also wonder what other elements or compounds would make a good detector. Is chlorine just the cheapest and most abundant element we have for these kinds of detectors?

Neutrinos make zero sense to me, but I am very fascinated by them and if they have some larger purpose not yet understood.

I know that there's been talk of creating a designed bacteria to breakdown and digest plastic for use in environmental contexts, but is there any scientific backing to the notion that mankind has already accidentally created bacteria that flourishes breaking down metal alloys or potentially biohazardous waste that's not naturally occurring? Are there any actual recorded examples of this happening?

In modern days, it seems drinking from even fairly large rivers these days without filtration or boiling seems (anecdotally) to have a nearly 1:1 correlation with illness. Have rivers and lakes gotten dirtier or more contaminated? Have we perhaps gotten weaker as our water became increasingly sourced from wells or other cleaner sources than rivers and lakes?

How quickly does this &quot;wandering&quot; happen, for example how much time would elapse between entering the alveolus and entering the blood (?) on the other side? And does something (e.g. picking up debris or a microbe) have to trigger the movement, or are they always wandering in and out on their own?

Text: Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for 'X' were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;.

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

Text: I am fortunate to have lived overseas in numerous countries and still live in the US.

The pattern I believe I am seeing across different countries is that, as winter gets shorter, spring remains colder for a longer period of time.

Just as a quick example, it's 55 degrees this morning in May, which I would call historically atypical for my location in the Midwest. I think this phenomenon has been growing over the past decade.

Likewise, I recall Thanksgivings of my youth featuring ground cover amounts of snow, and it hasn't been like that since my childhood. Instead,  it's more like there won't be ground cover until January...as if fall is pushing into winter, and spring is pushing into summer.

Is this discussed in climate research? Or is it just my own anecdotal evidence?

But why was it that the Asian giant hornets were never able to make it in America?

Edit: I have gotten a few great answers.  The gist if it is:

1: There was a great “eradication” program.

2: They can only spread so fast, and it’s at a pace much slower than I expected.

3: They are only well suited to thrive in coastal mountain areas, which includes a large but relatively small section of the west coast.  They never had the potential to take over the US.

Text: One of the concerns raised in discussions about geo-engineering the climate by dispersing reflective aerosols is the possibility of termination shock. 

2 questions: did this occur after the cooling effect from the Pinatubo eruption? And also what is the reason for termination shock exactly? 

I can’t seem to find a clear explanation. My guess, from what I’ve read, is that co2 would keep accumulating but the effects wouldn’t be felt until the intervention stopped and its effects wear off. As a result it would be like jumping to much higher co2 concentrations in a very short time. So would this only be a perceived effect on living things having to adapt to a large change in a short time or is something else going on?

Thanks!

A while ago I took a class in paradoxes and one group of paradoxes dealt with supertasks - tasks with an infinite number of steps that are completed in a finite amount of time - specifically ones where you'd take an infinite balls out of an urn.  The were all set up like take one ball out at t = .5, t = .75, etc.

There were some conclusions that resulted in the urn being empty at t = 1.  Now, I get that there's no last action in the abstract supertask.  However, in reality, if you have an urn full of balls (even if it's infinite), empty it one at a time, and end up with an empty urn, then you must have taken out a last ball, right?  Like, this seems to me as axiomatic as any of the math.

I sent the professor an email saying this, but he responded as thought I didn't &quot;get&quot; the idea of a supertask, explaining that there doesn't have to be a last step.  But I do get that.  I just think that it can't describe the emptying of an urn of balls one by one because that process necessitates a last ball.

So, can you empty an urn of balls one by one without removing a last ball?

Text: I know each type of cone has a wavelength of light it’s best at detecting. What I’m confused about is: is a green cone named a green cone because it’s best at detecting green wavelengths of light, or because it sends a signal to our brains that’s perceived as green? If an eye that only had green cones was shown a non-green color that falls under the spectrum of wavelengths a green cone is able to detect, would the brain perceive that color to some extent or would it only perceive green? I’ve seen people say that colors outside of red, green, and blue, such as yellow, are only perceived due to multiple cones being stimulated and the brain interpreting that as a different color, but would we be able to see yellow with only red or green cones?

Text: Heya, i was looking through one of my books (BiNaS, it’s basically a guide thing we use in the netherlands to look up many different formulas and vallues) that i use for chemistry and physics, and noticed in the chart of isotopes that the difference in mass between C-11, C-12, and C-13 is not the same.

It list a single C-11 isotope as having a mass of 11,011433 u, C-12 isotope as having a mass of 12,000000 u and C-13 isotope as having a mass of 13,003354 u.

I noticed the difference in mass between C-11 and C-12 is 0,988567 u, but the difference between C-12 and C-13 is 1,003354 u.

To my (highschool level) knowledge the only difference between these isotopes is having a different amount of neutrons, which are listed in my book as having a mass of 1,008665 u. So where does this different difference of mass come from?

Edit: i’ve tried looking up the answer to my question but all the results just tell me that the difference between these isotopes is how many neutrons they have, which i already knew and doesn’t answer my question :)

Text: Hello,
  

  
I've been trying to understand the nature of cancer and its origins better. From what I've learned, cancer typically begins with random mutations in our DNA that cause cells to start dividing uncontrollably and eventually form tumors. However, one aspect that puzzles me is the apparent randomness of these mutations versus the commonality of certain types of cancers among millions of people.
  

  
If the mutations are truly random, how is it that so many individuals end up developing the same types of cancer, such as breast, lung, or prostate cancer? 
  

  
I'm curious to hear your insights or if there are any recent studies that shed light on this topic. Thank you!

They joked they could &quot;take the heat and move it somewhere else&quot; when one of them realized that, with the carbon better capturing the heat, we really can't get rid of it? 

The problem of climate change, from what I understand, is that the atmosphere is trapping CO2 at a higher rate. There's excess energy in an enclosed environment. If it was localized weather, I guess we could just &quot;move it away.&quot; However, this energy is *everywhere* which kinda' screws us, I assume.

Clearly, my understanding of climate change is lacking.

Text: Hi r/askscience, I was prompted to ask a question which has been bothering me for a little while now:

We all know that burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, resulting in the greenhouse effect and giving rise to climate change. But what about the other by-product, water? Release of water vapour would mean that there are (presumably) more clouds which form, more rainfall, more ground saturation, more flooding, etc. Much like carbon dioxide, water is pretty energetically stable, and is surely not being removed from the system as quickly as it is being formed. So how impactful is it's formation on our climate? Can it contribute meaningfully to rising sea levels, for instance?

Text: Hi everyone.   


As the title says, and this might be a very stupid question: how do we process numbers in the context of longer texts or conversations? 

AFAIK, there's quite a lot written on shorter/longer/bigger/smaller multi-digit numbers from the perspective of mathematical cognition. However, they're studied in isolation from the usual contextual information you'd have if you'd encountered such a number in a 'normal' context, e.g. in conversation. 

Are numbers just processed holistically, somewhat like semantically-meaningful words? Digit-by-digit? How does it work? How are they linked to measurements expressed verbally, e.g. *5 pounds of...*? In short, how do we get from digits to meaningful phrases?

Text: So I was on my way to the doctor, and I got to thinking. I have no specific education in medicine and biology or such, so this may be built on false assumptions:

An immunocompromised person would presumably function as a sort of incubator for whatever disease they may be infected with. So I figured that perhaps they may be more infectious to people around them.

However, I could also argue that they're more susceptible to weaker diseases that might not affect a healthy person, and so not *really* be infectious.

Or maybe my presumptions are all wrong, and they'd be just as infectious as a normal person.

The scenario is built on the presumptions that healthy people are being introduced to the immunocompromised individual, without and quarantine, as well as no other infections being introduced.

Text: Surely wherever you are there will be a star closer to you than say a billion light years! So what's the actual number of lightyears for this limit, even very roughly?

For example, Wikipedia introduces Point Nemo as follows: &quot;It represents the solution to the &quot;longest swim&quot; problem. The problem entails finding such a place in the world ocean where, if a person fell overboard while on a ship at sea, they would be as far away from any land in any direction as possible.&quot; And the answer for the longest such distance is 2,688 km. Isn't it natural to ask for a similar question about a lost hypothetical interstellar traveler, the longest possible distance to the nearest star if one is stranded somewhere in the observable Universe (hoping for a rough estimate of the answer, of course it won't be remotely as precise)?

The density of intergalactic stars is apparently estimatable, Wikipedia says there are about a trillion in the Virgo cluster - which is exactly what prompted me to ask this question. If we know the place with the lowest density of intergalactic stars, then it's gotta be in it, and if that density is &quot;about one per [volume]&quot;, then the answer for the furthest you can ever get from a star in the observable Universe is about the cubic root of that [volume].

Text: Me and my friend have a spot in the woods with a lake and it's way up at the of the mountain and we have to cross a river some ways up. So I have a dumb question would the river be more intense or less intense in the spring at the top of the mountain? In my head I imagine all the rivers are like a traffic lane that all merge at the bottom of the valley but I honestly don't know?

Text: My understanding of Clinical Trials I that they should be double blind, in that neither the patient nor the clinician administering the drug and accompanying therapy know if the patient is in the placebo control group. 

  
But how can this work for clinical trials for psychoactive substances like MDMA, LSD, Psilocybin etc, surely the patient can tell if they're in the placebo group simply because they're not (in the case of something like LSD) 'tripping balls'? 

I've seen videos of MDMA therapy and the patient is lying there, frankly, off their head. Surely that rules out the blindness of the trial?

Text: Given how much of astronomy was discovered long ago before there were clocks nearly as precise or even calculators I would guess it should be possible to get a lot on your own. If you know that the Earth has an elliptical orbit and is tilted on its axis, by measuring the apparent altitude of the Sun throughout the year you could calculate the length of each day and the equation of time (I think). With a camera and telescope you could take photos throughout a year showing the changing size of the Sun to determine the eccentricity of the orbit. And so on for other factors and the Moon and planets too. Which leads to the question of how far could you get on your own. For example, I believe it should be possible to measure the synodic draconic and anomalistic months so you could get the saros cycle, but could you go further and predict where the Sun and Moon would appear to be for any given place on Earth, therefore letting you predict all eclipses, not just those in a single saros cycle (I would expect the distance to be Moon to be an important factor in this but that might be measurable by either using the distance to the Moon within a single night to vary by approximately the radius of the Earth or by having 2 people 1000s of miles apart and parallax with the stars). The time scales for other planets can be many years as opposed to a month or year for the Moon/Sun so that's why I'm not focusing on that yet.

Text: In the ABO blood group classification, it is the type of sugar that is produced by an enzyme in the bodies of individuals with those blood types determines their blood type. This enzyme produces sugar, but for what reason? Does the sugar produced become available for use within muscles or something? 
These sugars are the antigens that are the defining characteristics of the different blood types, so to say they can be consumed by the muscles would seem strange as that would mean that at some point those blood cells turn to O (once rinsed of their antigen by the muscle), so I'm assuming the production of these sugars is not for the purpose of fuelling the muscles. What is the specific purpose of the production of these sugars?

Text: I was [reading about a hotel in West Virginia](https://mountaineerhotel.com/history) recently, and came across this passage.

&gt;From April 2-5, 1977, heavy rain fell in the Appalachians. The National Weather Service reports that some areas in West Virginia received **up to 15.5 inches of rain.** This massive amount of rain caused the Tug River to rise to record-setting levels and overflow. Williamson, along with The Mountaineer Hotel, was one of the flood casualties. By April 5th, **water had risen above 53 feet** in downtown Williamson. Waters had reached the mezzanine level, fully encompassing the basement and lobby, of the hotel.  

How is it possible that 15.5 inches of rainfall doesn't translate to 15.5 inches of water level rise? How does it accumulate exponentially?

Because this is a new technology I know that currently they can tell if people got a broken nose and it got cured and survived or a broken arm.

Text: I understand that there are many ways to observe a small induced current in an open AC circuit. For example : due to a capacitive effect in an open switch or due to the proximity of the two poles. 

But imagine this scenario: an AC circuit with two terminals that are far apart and completely isolated from the outside world.

In this scenario, I wonder if there is still an infinitesimal current that flows. Indeed, if I understand electrostatics correctly, there are still very small displacements of electrons due to the change in voltage and the capacity of the wire.

By extension, if we put a large capacitor on the branch : even in an open circuit, I imagine that we will observe a current for a certain time?

I don't know if my intuition is correct or not? If so, how can this be calculated?

(I am putting aside, in this question, the effects of radiation due to the antenna effect which would necessarily induce energy loss).

Thank you.

But it creeps, AFAIK, along with the San Andreas. When I try to find answers to this question, all I get is plate boundary faults and explanations involving plate tectonics. The San Andreas is clearly active next to the Hayward fault (assuming the epicenter of the 1906 earthquake is correct). I assume I have an overly simplistic understanding of faults, so if someone could paint a picture for me, I’d be much obliged.

I recently watched the Expanse (great show) where a [Belter slingshots himself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIpAZOR4Gl8) around the rings. How accurate is this in theory? I would think he'd get hit by a stray dust particle.

Text: After doing some reading I have heard that herpes viruses tend to break out in a person after a variety of triggers, such as stress, sun exposure, illness, hormonal changes etc…, and people can avoid outbreaks by avoiding these causes.  These sources have also stated, however, that it is unclear whether or not these directly impact outbreaks. Furthermore, it is known that lots of people with herpes tend to never show any symptoms, while others may experience them highly frequently. Is there a definite correlation between these triggers and outbreaks, and can a person’s immune system or genetics play a role in their occurrences?

1) are the lights from aurorae just highly energetic, even if they're dim in the visible spectrum, so that they end up being captured better by CCDs?

2) when taking pictured at sunset, perhaps there's still enough ambient light bouncing off environmental surroundings, whereas taking pictures of the aurora, there's no ground illumination to compete with.

Text: Hi Reddit! I am a researcher from the University of Maryland here to answer your questions about lightning this Lightning Safety Awareness Week.

**Daile Zhang** is an Assistant Research Scientist at the University of Maryland's Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center (ESSIC). Her research focuses on evaluating and assessing lightning data from different lightning locating systems, including ground-based and satellite-based networks. Daile serves on the Board of Directors for the African Centres for Lightning and Electromagnetics Network and is a U.S. National Lightning Safety Council member. She also serves on the World Meteorological Organization's Committee on Weather and Climate Extremes and helped certify two new megaflash lightning records in 2022. Daile and her co-author Ronald Holle published an educational booklet &quot;So You Think You Know Lightning&quot; in 2017 and a Springer book &quot;[Flashes of Brilliance: The Science and Wonder of Arizona Lightning](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-19879-3)&quot; in 2023. In 2024, Daile took the lead in organizing the 2024 International Lightning Safety Day event to mitigate lightning hazards worldwide.

**About Lightning Safety Awareness Week:** National Lightning Safety Awareness Week started in 2001 to call attention to lightning being an underrated killer. Since then, U.S. lightning fatalities have dropped from about 55 per year to less than 30. This reduction in lightning fatalities is largely due to the greater awareness of lightning danger and people seeking safety when thunderstorms threaten.

I'll be on from **2 to 4 p.m. ET (18-20 UT)** - ask me anything!

Or are lungs just something animals like whales and dolphins have to deal with because they evolved from terrestrial animals?

Text: Specifically your classic sugary sodas such as Coke, Pepsi, or Sprite and your typical grocery store juices like apple and grape juice.

I just got into a fairly involved debate with a person who I tried to tell that the idea that Coke etc dehydrate you is a myth and that while obviously not being as effective as water, these beverages don’t technically “dehydrate you”.  Not referring to a marathon runner, person in a desert, or anything like that.

From the time I spent researching myself it seems hard to nail down simple researched answers except regarding outlier scenarios like diabetics, excessive drinking of caffeine, etc.  Most offhand forum results and “blog” type pieces I saw agree that the idea that soda dehydrates you is a myth but I’m short on actual evidence or science.

Text: Sea water contains [roughly 35,000mg of salt per liter (1000ml).](https://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/ocean/sea-water) At 20 °C (68 °F), [one liter of water can dissolve about 350,000mg of salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_water) (10x the amount in sea water). Adult humans should have no more than [2,300mg salt per day](https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-education-resources-materials/sodium-your-diet), which I assume is related to how much salt the kidney can (safely) filter. (I couldn't find anything related to the kidney's salt-filtration power after several minutes of googling.)

By my flawed logic, humans should be able to drink some small amount of sea water, excrete the excess salt using a fraction of the sea water consumed, and then keep the remaining desalinated sea water for hydration.

Using hard numbers: Consume 25ml of sea water containing \~875mg salt, urinate \~3ml of water containing all \~875mg of salt, keep \~22ml water for hydration.

Even if salt can't be excreted at the density at which it can be dissolved, there's still room for more water to be used for urination that's also less than the amount consumed.

I know I've taken several logical leaps here, but without additional information I have no choice but to wonder. What am I missing? Thank you.

Text: Hello Reddit! I'm Joao De Aquino, an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine. My work uses behavioral pharmacology, psychophysical methods, and clinical trial strategies to develop novel treatments for pain and addiction. Joining me today are Julio Nunes, a PGY-2 Psychiatry Resident, and Gabriel Costa, a medical student, who both play integral roles in our Pain and Addiction Interaction Neurosciences (PAIN) Lab. Our latest work, a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis featured in the American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse (AJDAA), revealed that cannabis use does not significantly change non-medical opioid use among individuals undergoing opioid use disorder treatment. This finding challenges many outdated policies in U.S. opioid treatment settings, where people who use cannabis might encounter obstacles to accessing crucial medications for opioid use disorder, such as methadone and buprenorphine. We're here and eager to engage with your queries about addiction science, approaches to treating substance use disorders, or insights on publishing within the field of addiction.

Text: The Pampas Deer (*Ozotoceros bezoarticus*) used to be one of the most common mid-sized mammals in South America, with tens of millions of them across grasslands and savannas of the continent. However, centuries of overhunting and habitat fragmentation have drastically reduced their numbers to around one hundred thousand, reducing their distribution to the Pantanal, the Cerrado and some isolated spots. Some say as much as 98% of their range has been lost. In fact, many Brazilians nowadays don't even know our country has deers, even though we have 8 species of them. The larger Marsh Deer (*Blastocerus dichotomus)* has also been impacted by the loss of its habitat, large wetlands.

However, despite fragmentating as much of its open ecosystems and deer hunting being legalized to this day, the deer populations of the United States still have millions of individuals, to the point they may cause problems due to overpopulation. How did they manage to preserve their deer numbers so efficiently? And why did the reasons not apply to Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina and other countries with vulnerable deer species?

Text: **Please read this entire post carefully and format your application appropriately.**

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/15186wx/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxiv/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).
* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)
* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)
* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?
* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

\-------------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

`Username: /u/foretopsail`

`General field: Anthropology`

`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`

`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`

`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`

`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

Given that electromagnetic fields extend infinitely and create interactions between every charged particle (within the limits of causality), then if the electromagnetic force is mediated by photons, does that mean that every electron (for example) is constantly exchanging photons with *every other* electron within its light cone?

...it seems like an awful lot of photons. Or is this just a problem caused by relativity meeting quantum mechanics?

But what prevented them from continuing southwards? Was South America simply too hot and humid for them? Were there animals present that already filled the same ecological niche that the bears serve in the north hemisphere? Did early human interactions stop them before they did?

What about American black bears? I know they’re way more adaptable than grizzlies, and they still live as far south as Mexico. What stopped them?

Text: Hello,
  

  
I recently had a flu vaccine and was wondering about the effect on older ones.
  

  
From the very limited amount that I understand, the body creates antibodies and memory cells in response to a vaccine, which helps your body fight the disease in future.
  

  
However there is presumably a finite number of possible antibodies and memory cells in a body. As such, does having a new vaccine dilute the effect of previous ones to any significant degree?

As an example, if someone takes a flu vaccine every year for forty years, would this be expected to have an effect on reducing defenses against illnesses they were vaccinated against when a child? 

Many thanks in advance! (I searched to see if this was covered but all responses that come up are questions about COVID vaccines from 2021-23)

Now the second group gets a combination vaccine (like a 2 in 1) of meningitis and chicken pox in one arm and now placebo in the other arm. I'm having difficulty explaining this as a FAQ to patients without scaring them away. The trial is observer blinded only.

Text: I am working with a high school freshman on understanding the Krebs cycle. The student has become exceptionally frustrated by not being able to know the destination of the 2 hydrogen that are lost from malate as it becomes oxaloacetate at the end of the Krebs cycle. We know one becomes part of NADH but me telling him &quot;it likely is a part of another metabolic pathway&quot; has not been a satisfactory answer. Please note: this attention to detail goes far beyond the level to which this course is typically taught at this level. This student is simply curious and I am doing my best to satisfy his curiosity. 

We've been primarily using the [model posted in khan academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/cellular-respiration-and-fermentation/pyruvate-oxidation-and-the-citric-acid-cycle/a/the-citric-acid-cycle?loggedInViaDiscussion=true) as well as [this video](https://youtu.be/d9hffYCwfEA?feature=shared&amp;t=3332) from &quot;The organic chemistry tutor&quot; (timestamped to the part that has caused the frustration).

Text: So photons are the carriers of the electromagnetic force, gluons are the carriers of the strong nuclear force, and W/Z bosons are the carriers of the weak nuclear force. Why is it that of these particles, only photons are ever observed in a “free” state? Is it because the electromagnetic force has an infinite range, whereas the other two are limited to the subatomic range?

Bonus question: if the forces are unified at higher energies (i.e. electroweak), is there a different particle that would carry the unified force, or would it be both particles?

Why does skin burn in the sun (red or deeper brown), but dead bodies such as those on Everest bleach to a bright white? 

Would it not be the same biological process or is it just because there’s no red/white cells to react to the damage?

And then I saw a post of a dinosaur depicted with feathers/more bird like, and started wondering if dinosaurs also had hollow bones. What I’ve found so far is that birds that have hollow bones have heavier skeletons due to increased bone density despite the “air pockets” (ie a 2oz bird and a 2oz mouse, the birds skeleton would be heavier). Also that it’s not every bone that’s hollow and that diving birds have fewer hollow bones in comparison to birds that rely more on flight. But yeah, this just piqued my curiosity.

Today I am here to discuss my research exploring an in-depth mechanism of a gene in estrogen receptor negative breast cancer metastasis. I am analyzing how this gene impacts metastasis and the mechanisms behind the gene that are impacting metastasis.

I completed my postbac and Ph.D. at the NIH in the same lab. Returning to the same lab for my Ph.D. was an easy decision as I find the research fascinating, and Dr. Hunter is an incredible mentor. The collaborative environment made the lab the perfect fit for my training. During my Ph.D., I have been actively involved in science communication. As a fluent user of both American Sign Language and English, communicating science
in an accessible manner is particularly important to me. Over the past few years, I wrote several articles about cancer in layman terms for OncoBites and the importance of having qualified scientific interpreters in STEM. I was also featured in a few podcasts, including NCI's Inside Cancer Careers podcast and NPR.

I am here Tuesday, May 7, from **12:00 - 2:00 pm (ET; 16-18 UT)** to answer your questions about my research and experience conducting research at NIH.

2) I've read that radiocarbon dating cannot work on rocks, and it definitely cannot be used to date items past the 60 000 years mark. How would anyone be able to even accurately date it?

Text: Hello folks,

I've got a question about iron in human biology. I know that it's used for lots of things, but I don't really know what it actually does: I know it's present in blood, and I read something about a protein called ferritin that's present in most cells, but I have no idea *how* it assists with blood or what ferritin *does*. And I'm sure iron does other things in the body that I don't know about!

So, I've got three questions:

1. What things does iron do in the body, and how does it do them?
2. What is it about iron that makes it able to do these things? Could another kind of metal do the same thing, or does it *have* to be iron? Maybe another kind of ferromagnetic metal?
3. Does iron interact, or is it involved, with DNA at all? Or no?

I'd appreciate it, too, if you could explain this in as simple terms as possible, because I am not at all a biologist or physician. Thank you!

Text: From my high school chemistry class, I remember that salts with a higher van't Hoff factor do a better job at lowering the freezing point of water because they disassociate into more particles when dissolved in water. 

It is my understanding that most roads (in the US at least) are salted with sodium chloride, which only has a van't hoff factor of 2 (dissociates into 2 particles, 1 Na+ ion and 1 Cl- ion).  


 Why don't they use a more effective salt that has a higher van't Hoff factor, like Magnesium Chloride (dissociates into 3 particles, 1 Mg+2 ion and 2 Cl- ions)? Wouldn't those salts do a better job at keeping the roads clear?

Text: Our newborn just had their first vaccination at 8 weeks old and that cry was heartbreaking. 

Now we were wondering why vaccines dont get given to the mom to pass onto the child via breastfeeding. Is it not possible or is the current way the most effective one? 

I tried googling this, but the results just show 'breastfeeding helps keep the baby calm'. 

Edit: I don't know why everyone seems to get from the above that I won't have my child vaccinated anymore. My child will be vaccinated, we were just curious if there wasn't an easier way to pass it onto the baby.

Or do they just innately understand it and follow their instinct?

Sometimes I have seen these standalone hills in seas, and that often makes me wonder if the sea level was lower in the past, or if the rock/hill has risen above due to tectonic movements, or something else is happening?

  
How exactly are these layers formed?

Text: So I've learned a good deal about imprinted genes and disorders associated with imprinting in my education. I've also heard of but never really studied the process of producing an animal in a lab with a single set of maternal DNA. It seems to me that for this to be done successfully whoever is producing this animal would need to find a way of reproducing methylation patterns that occur during spermatogenesis otherwise the resulting specimen would be unviable. I assume I am either grossly misinformed about how cloning animals work or am missing an important part about imprinting. Thanks for any help this question has been driving me crazy since I first heard about imprinting but don't feel compiled to invest the time it would take to figure it out myself.

Is there a way to actually measure the range of the likelihood of a mutation that would allow to easy person-to-person spread of the bird flu? 

And along the same lines - are epidemiologists concerned about this? Irritated at useless and uninformed headlines that overstate the risk? Stocking up on canned goods?

Text: Question is in the subject line above. For a more extended backstory behind this question:

This question arises from some research I've been doing on pet food safety. There is a prominent theory that legumes/pulses (like peas, lentils, chickpeas) impact food absorption or body mechanisms in a way that causes diet-associated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) aka enlargening of the heart chamber in dogs and maybe cats (this started from widespread reports to the FDA about grain-free diets and non-genetic DCM cases which led to the FDA issuing an alert and investigation into this issue).

Apparently in the pet food industry, only less than a handful of brands are ever vet-recommended mainly because their ingredients and the interactions of those ingredients in those forms have been researched front and back on safety. Namely corn. 

So apparently, when mixed with meat products, corn is harmless, but legumes might be causing severe heart problems. Why is that? I know there isn't enough research on this specifically, but in a broader sense and theoretical aspect, how can food combinations do this?

My question is how is the energy released? All I get on the internet is the atom is split into two smaller ones, and this converts the mass to energy… so is the mass not destroyed? Does the conservation of mass not apply here? Where does the energy come from and why is it so much?

Text: I recently got &quot;diagnosed&quot; with &quot;some sort of arthritis&quot; (they are still figuring things out) and in general have been dealing with random symptoms throughout my life, which has led me to read up on several autoimmune diseases throughout the years.

And they all seem to have one thing in common:  
We have either no idea why they happen (and in some cases not even the mechanism behind the symptoms). Or at most, a host of theories and maybe some knowledge about (potentially) involved genes (but even then, only theories, if at all, as to what actually triggers the onset).

Why is it such a struggle to figure out how autoimmune diseases work?

For comparison, the brain is still considered pretty much a black box and yet it seems to me we have more of a clue about how mental illnesses come to be, how they work, and how to diagnose and treat them, than we have about autoimmune diseases.

Text: Or more specifically, what's the time constant for the body producing spike proteins from the mRNA vaccine? Let's say, the time it takes for the body to generate half the spike proteins it will generate from the vaccine (similar to half-life). 

If you can describe the entire time course of the vaccine even better (including all the stages: spike protein production, immune response, antibody production, etc.).

And is it different for Moderna vs Pfizer?

Are the cells that HIV infects &quot;immortal&quot; and last a full human lifetime?

Though I have somewhat of a grasp of VDJ recombination, and those basic diversity generating processes, I am confused on how your B cells ALWAYS end up generating the correct antibody to whatever antigens we encounter. Is it just an extreme statistical improbability for them not to do so?

Text: I was thinking about concussions and how devastating they can be to the brain and I wondered if there were ways to mitigate the damage sustained from your brain smacking across solid bone. Then I thought about how woodpeckers protect themselves with their tongue as padding. I wondered why humans hadn’t evolved a similar soft tissue padding inside their skulls before realizing we didn’t have much need for it as head injuries probably weren’t a common cause of death in our history. Then I thought about how Neanderthals are said to have bigger brains and I’m assuming we think that because they had larger skulls and assumed it must’ve been filled with more Brian’s. But I’ve heard they were able to take much larger blows, say from a big animal, and survive. Being knocked around because of an insistence to use melee combat when hunting as opposed to spear probably would result in alot of deaths due to head injuries. So my question is, is there a possibility that they had larger skulls to make room for a kind of soft tissue padding for their brains? I mean if they had larger brains wouldn’t they have figured out that if they were dying to Homo sapiens because they’re throwing spears then maybe they should’ve done the same?

How long can I expect them to return to this &quot;dry&quot; spot?

I know they communicate food source locations, but can they also tell each other NOT to go somewhere? 

What happens to bad source information in the bee brains? Do they forget?  Or does the info just get replaced by newer better information, like computer reformatting?

Because this would only work for systems whose solar plane is lined up with Earth, does that mean that for most exosystems (that being the ones that are not lined up with Earth), we don't have a way to detect exoplanets there, and by extension if they are habitable, have life, etc?

Text: On Wikipedia the circumference of the globe is stated to the meter which is pretty accurate. I'm assuming this means we know the base featureless shape to a very high precision. 

I don't know how much of the earth has been topographically mapped or if they have all been combined into one global surface model. But if we have, how accurate is it? If I were to take random samples how accurate would the height be? +- 100m? More? Less? 

I feel like it depends heavily on what you define the earth's surface as. Most of the ocean isn't mapped so if we assume that the surface stops at sea level how much does that improve the accuracy?

the article was talking about how rats choose mates that are immunologically different from themselves (dissimilar MHC). the theory has been stretched to humans. for example: 1995 t-shirt sniff at uni.

my question is: isn’t every organisms MHC and immune system unique? if every organisms is different and no two are indentical then how much weight does this theory hold? is there like a quantifiable scale of difference? 
I’m meaning is there an ideal level of immunological difference? say only 10%, 20%, 30% identical? anyway just how important is MHC in mating behavior?

I do not know science at all haha out of my realm just curious. could be an awful question.

So could that extra 100 million years have lead to differences we can see/measure today. For example could the west coast have bigger or deeper water aquifers due to the millions of years of hurricanes dumping water inland that the east coast didn't get? could the soil be saltier due to tidal flooding? could there be more offshore oil on the west coast due to the extra 100 million years of whales, sharks, plankton, and other sea life or larger calcium deposits from the extra shellfish species?

Text: Conflicting messages in the textbooks on this one. I understand that co-operative binding occurs, resulting in each sequential O2 bound to the Hb tetramer to be easier to add than the previous. However, both the following seem plausible to me as a consequence of this phenomenon:

1. Hypothesis 1: the majority of haemoglobin exists fully-saturated oxyhemoglobin or fully-desaturated deoxyhaemoglobin, with % saturations being based on a ratio of the two. This is because oxygen will preferentially bind to haemoglobin molecules which have already overcome the relatively high energy barrier required to bind the first oxygen molecule.
2. Hypothesis 2: the % saturation represents a ratio of amount of oxygen carried by the haemoglobin and the amount that could be carried by the haemoglobin. I.e. a population of Hb molecules at 75% saturation would all contain a distribution of oxygen molecules centred on a mean of 3. Under this hypothesis, only the last (fourth) molecule tends to be loaded at the lungs and unloaded at the tissues. 

So which one is it? Both seem plausible. Both are given as explanations in (different) sources. Only the former seems to be compatible with my understanding of how a pulse oximeter works.

Text: Overwhelmingly, the answers I've seen to this question on Reddit and elsewhere are anecdotal, so I would love to read any answers supported by strong research. However, I recognize that designing studies to answer this question are probably challenging due to sample size concerns, confounding, selection biases, etc.
  

  
A few important qualifiers to this question:
  

  
(1) I am specifically referring to primary and secondary education, not post-secondary education.
  

  
(2) I recognize that &quot;life outcomes&quot; is vague, but my goal was to keep the scope broad. Things that come to mind when I think of &quot;life outcomes&quot; which could be impacted by school type include, but are not limited to: substance use disorders/mental illness in childhood or adulthood; non-psychiatric illness in adulthood; expected lifetime wealth; expected lifetime career satisfaction; expected marital/relationship satisfaction; etc.

(3) I'd be open to comparisons between children who attend &quot;average&quot; private schools vs. those who attend &quot;average&quot; public schools... OR other comparisons, such as children who attend &quot;average&quot; private schools vs. those who attend &quot;above-average&quot; public schools. Again, I recognize that what constitutes an &quot;average&quot; school, or an &quot;above-average&quot; school, is vague, but I'd be open to any number of different operationalizations of these constructs (e.g., student-teacher ratios, AP classes offered, number of extracurriculars offered, etc.).

After any process the total entropy in the universe always increases or stays the same. How does this play into this concept? From this holistic perspective, can we say that there is a “forward” and a “backward” direction to time flow, but that this naming is arbitrary and physics makes no distinction as to which one is the “real” one? So an equivalent principle would be that total entropy always decreases, and time flows in the other direction? Or from a physics perspective is time flow in either direction indistinguishable?

Text: It’s kinda easy to track a woman’s hormonal cycle because ours is punctuated with our periods, but I was wondering if males also have a cycle that’s just harder to track without some sort of technology.

Also, if they do have a cycle, are there specific times where they feel weird? While the old fashioned ideas on how much hormones affect women’s behavior are blow WAY out of proportion, I do tend to feel like shit mentally right before my period starts, and I was wondering if men also have something like that, and people just never talk about it.

Text: Edit: clarification and working hypothesis:

I didn't mean the southern lights, I meant the northern lights that had stretched unusually far south.

I think what's going on, and what I wasn't clear enough in my question to get at, is that 1) as lots of comments say, color varies with altitude and 2) as I failed to clarify, I think I'm south of where the aurora is actually happening.

I think I'm used to people taking pictures from inside the aurora, where they're surrounded by green. But because I'm south of it,the low altitude green is blocked by the curve of the earth, and I can only see high altitude pink.

Text: I’m sure it depends on their location/climate. Maybe it’s best to focus on comfortable climates. 

I was watching someone on TikTok make the point that Ted Kazinski said in his manifesto that he wanted humans to return to the time before technology started booming because early humans were focused solely on survival and he liked that for some reason.

It all got me thinking, how hard was it out there for early man?

I’m talking pre agriculture Homo sapiens. Part of me agrees and thinks it was hard for my ancient brothers and sisters and that existence would be a constant toggle between fight and flight. But another part of me thinks, wait a minute. Those dudes pretty much had all of my cognitive ability. They just lacked my technology and cultural knowledge. Maybe these guys are smart enough to get food fast and then chill for the rest of the day.

Isn’t that what our technology comes from - leisure time? Maybe these mother fuckers had it in droves. 

To be clear, I’m not saying Ted Kazinsky was on to something. The process of getting back to those days is a non-starter. 

I’m just wondering if there was a golden age of kicking it for thousands of years rolling out of bed and spending 2 hours per day hunting and gathering and then doing an hour or so of chores and shit and then the rest of the day is yours. 

was inventing agriculture a mistake?

I know they're specialized but surely at some point a person would accidentally ingest one and it would make its way into our gut where it can spread. So why aren't they more of a problem for humans?

Text: So I think I know the answer but not sure and didn’t know how to word it on google. 

So I know that when you jump on a plane you land in the same spot due to conservation of momentum and obviously your face also stays the same but when you watch those videos of astronauts in g force simulators their faces move around like they’re getting pulled back. So I was wandering what’s the exact reason that conservation of momentum doesn’t apply here? I’d assume it’s because of the massive speed difference and maybe something to do with gravity but I’m not sure. Or is it because it’s the rapid increase in speed like when a plane or car starts to accelerate and your head goes back? If so would their face return to normal if they were at it for a long time?
 
Sorry if this is a stupid question I’m not sure and thank you for any answers.

Text: I was using a pretty realistic map generator, which at one point yielded a very interesting feature on one of the continents: a river that began in the arctic tundra of the southern hemisphere, and snaked its way through taiga and steppes and deserts and forests, well into the tropics, until it reached the sea north of the equator. Depending on the season, parts of the river, in the desert, almost dried out, while at peak, the river's discharge when it entered the sea in the tropics was about 3 million m^(3)/s. I think the river was at least 13 000 km long? Winding of course...

Does anything of this seem remotely plausible? The Nile isn't nearly that long, I mean in terms of distance from the equator. The longest river I seem to be able to find any evidence of, prehistorically I mean, seems to be closer to 10 000 km. And that discharge... isn't it more than all rivers of Earth combined? I know much higher discharge rates have occurred in geological times, like the Zanclean flood, which was much, much bigger, or the Missoula floods... but they were very temporary. Could such a high discharge as this fictional river actually work, if continents looked differently? Would so much water in a river system somehow affect the climate, or is that amount of water still far too small to be noticed in the grand scheme of things? Rather: could enough water even be deposited by rain, or from glacier melt water?

Im just curious if atoms that have the expanded octet feature also can make bonds like this and theoretically create complex molecules with maybe even up to six other atoms. Or are those bonds much less stable or something? (And I also suppose four bonds is completely sufficient for creating complex molecules but I’m just curious)

Text: I wear a very thick mask to sleep. It blocks out light really well, and with it on I can't tell when the bedroom light is on or off.

However, this morning with the bright sun shining through my window onto my pillow, I realised that I can tell when my eyes are in direct sunlight, even though what I'm &quot;seeing&quot; is still complete blackness. It feels uncomfortable, like looking too close to the sun does (although less intense). Closing my eyes makes very little difference. Putting my hands over my eyes makes the sensation noticeably less intense.

This leads me to wonder, am I picking up on non-visible light that is able to pass through my mask? Do my eyes have some way of detecting strong UV light that's separate from &quot;vision&quot;? If so, how does this work? Are some blind people also able to perceive direct sunlight? 

If not, what else could explain this?

He has a B.S. and M.S. from Arizona State University and a Ph.D. from the University at Buffalo, SUNY and currently works as a research scientist with the University of Maryland on a cooperative agreement at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. In the field, he collects high-resolution topographic data using a terrestrial laser scanner. The data inform volcanic mapping and provide ground truth for remote sensing measurements. Patrick uses remote sensing data to characterize explosive volcanic stratigraphy on Mars. His work has implications for volcano hazard mapping, on Earth, and for interpreting volcanic histories of the terrestrial planets.

I'll be on from **1 to 3 p.m. ET (17-19 UT)** - ask me anything!

And even after language was established, how and when were rules so specifically created, like grammar and rules like that?

Text: I feel like this question gets asked quite often, but I haven't seen any responses that would satisfy my.

Can we be cartain that everyone sees colors the same way? I'm not talking about colorblindness.

People usually reply with ,,we can't know&quot;, or ,,there are slight diffrences&quot;, but I want to know if we can reasonably assume that someone's blue might be another person's red.

I know it's technically possible, because we can't really check color interpretation differences between people, but this doesn't seem right to me. 

Could our brains really perceive colors so differently? I mean if you look at the color spectrum, blue and red are far apart. How would our brains come to such different results? Wouldn't everything have to be swapped around? 

The wavelength of red is around 700nm and the wavelength of blue is around 500nm. If some people saw red as blue, why would their brain jump from orange to blue without any colors in between?

Another thing is, wouldn't that result in a lot of people having color blindness? Chances of having colorblindness are quite low, especially if you have XX chromosomes. Wouldn't a lot of people perceiving colors very differently lead to genes often mixing in a way that would leave some blind spots on the spectrum?

Text: Hi Reddit! We are human genetics and genomics researchers here to discuss how genetics and the environment interact.

Many human diseases have a genetic component. Some diseases result from a change in a single gene or even multiple genes. Yet, many diseases are complex and stem from an interaction between genes and the environment. Environmental factors may include chemicals in the air or water, nutrition, microbes, ultraviolet radiation from the sun and social context.

We are members of the [American Society of Human Genetics](https://www.ashg.org/) (ASHG) and are holding this panel as part of ASHG's [DNA Day](https://www.genome.gov/dna-day) celebrations and the announcement of the [2024 DNA Day Essay Contest](https://www.ashg.org/dna-day/) - a contest for high school students around the world in which students examine, question, and reflect on an important topic in genetics.

We are here **all day** to take your questions - ask us anything!

Text: So spontaneous synchronization is the idea that multiple oscillators that are physically connected in some way, can spontaneously synchronize their oscillations. 

My question is, is it possible to construct some system such that the random vibrations of molecules due to their thermal energy could spontaneously synchronize?  Could macroscopic movement arise from these microscopic thermal vibrations?

It feels like what I'm suggesting would violate the second law of thermodynamics,  but im not entirely sure about that.  As spontaneous synchronization of any oscillators also feels like it'd violate this law yet it obviously is real.

Perhaps it is possible, but only for sufficiently small systems?  I recall from a statistical mechanics class i took years ago that certain weird phenomena were actually possible for sufficiently small systems (such as a decrease in entropy for a small collection of particles, as the more orderly microstates were far more likely simply due to the number of permutations being much smaller)

Edit:  after seeing some comments I'd like to point out that I'm asking if *any* such material/structure could exist.  Obviously most everyday materials do not exhibit this behavior in anyway

+ I'm the first Black man and second person of color to ever lead the EPA. It's fun when things come full circle, because I started my career at the agency as an intern (don't ask me how long it's been).
+ I'm originally from Goldsboro, North Carolina and a proud graduate of NC A&amp;T. Aggie pride!
+ Like many people, my passion for the environment developed while exploring the outdoors as a kid. I would hunt and fish with my father and grandfather in rural North Carolina, and I love seeing that same spark of
curiosity in my own 10-year-old son now.
+ As a member of President Biden's cabinet, I've had the honor of traveling to 30+ states and 13 countries meeting with folks who care deeply about protecting public health and the environment.
+ Just like anyone starting a new job, I had a big list of goals in mind - tackling climate change, advancing environmental justice - but my philosophy comes down to this... I want to make sure all people have clean
air to breathe, clean water to drink, and the opportunity to lead a healthy life. It's really that simple!

We’ve had a busy few weeks at the agency – just yesterday we announced the selectees for our $7 billion dollar Solar for All program, which follows our $20 billion dollar Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund announcement from two weeks ago! We’ve also  finalized stronger pollution standards for cars and trucks, banned ongoing uses of asbestos, protected 100 million people from PFAS in drinking water, and made good on a promise to folks in Cancer Alley and overburdened communities across the nation by slashing cancer-causing pollution from chemical plants.  There’s lots to talk about, and that’s why I’m so excited to be here today... so ask me anything!

[Proof](https://twitter.com/EPAMichaelRegan/status/1782524048821408172)

PS. If anyone has tips for a good baseball pitch, I’ll also take that – I'm throwing the first pitch at the National-Dodgers game tonight and want to throw a pitch as strong as our plan to fight climate change.

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/198hzvn/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxv/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).
* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)
* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)
* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?
* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

\-------------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

`Username: /u/foretopsail`

`General field: Anthropology`

`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`

`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`

`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`

`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

You can submit your application by replying to this post.

Text: I've been seeing antiviral nasal sprays mentioned more often recently, especially in &quot;covid conscious&quot; communities. The products claim to both block viruses from being absorbed in the nasal cavity and to &quot;inactivate&quot; viruses.

1. Is there any credible evidence that these products do anything to prevent viral infections?
2. Even if these products *did* completely prevent viruses from being absorbed through membranes in the nose, would it matter?

Examples of some products that are being marketed under this umbrella:

- [BioSURE \(Ethyl Lauroyl Arginate Hydrochloride\)](https://bebiosure.com/blogs/blogs/the-science-behind-biosure-pro-protective-nasal-spray-and-why-it-really-does-work)
    - &quot;the BioSURE PRO formulation is able to block and even inactivate the virus to help naturally reduce the risk of infection&quot;
- [Covixyl (also ELAH](https://covixyl.com/pages/about)
    - &quot;The molecule binds to cells in the nose where it blocks the virus from attaching to nasal tissue and inactivates virus particles&quot;
    - &quot;Initial testing against SARS-CoV-2, Rotavirus, H1N1 (Influenza A), and Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) proved the efficacy of ELAH against infection in vitro, showing 99+% reduction across all 4 viruses.  &quot;
- [Enovid \(Nitric Oxide Nasal Spray\)](https://buyenov.com/pages/clinical-data)
    - &quot;...participants who took NONS after COVID-19 exposure were 75% less likely to become infected when compared to the control group...&quot;
    - &quot;After confirmed exposure to COVID-19, infection rate in participants (n=625) who took NONS™ was 6.4% versus 25.6% in the control group (P&lt;0.0001).&quot;
- Bonus: [Xlear \(Xylitol\)](https://xlear.com/xlear-sinus-care/). Not *currently* claiming anything about COVID, I assume because they are being [sued by the FDA](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/10/ftc-sues-utah-based-company-falsely-claiming-its-nasal-sprays-can-prevent-treat-covid-19)

So, is the catalyst the oils or salts on your skin or?

Text: Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Biology, Chemistry, Neuroscience, Medicine, Psychology**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for 'X' were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;.

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

I imagine an asteroid can’t form an atmosphere, but then what’s the smallest gravity that could hold one? And especially one that would allow Earth life to survive? Thanks.

Text: It occurred to me that since there's nothing to push against in space, maybe you need to emit _something_ in opposite direction to move forward, and I presume that if you want to move something heavy by emitting something light, you need that light thing to go quite fast.

I was curious if this is correct and if so, does it mean that for a space ship to accelerate or decelerate the implication is that it will always lose weight? Is this an example of entropy?

The body recognizes that the splinter is a foreign object and it rejects it. If someone breathes is grilling food and breathes in the smoke they will cough and wheeze. They cough and wheeze because the body recognizes the smoke is a foreign object and coughing is the body’s way of pushing the smoke out. Why doesn’t the human body reject tattoos in the same way?

I know the moon is slowly pulling away from us and making our years longer by a fraction of a second, but how much do those milliseconds add up in 250 million years? I saw a source online saying that in 100 million years it will add half an hour to a day, but I don't know how true this is. If that is true and we would have an extra 1.5 hours per day, would that be that we would basically have 22.8 extra days? (I could be wrong here, math isn't my strong suit)

If anyone can help answer my question that would be greatly appreciated 🙏

Text: Hello, Reddit!

We are members of Iverson Lab at Vanderbilt University, Dr. Tina Iverson and Prash Singh. We study the connection between metabolism and cell fate when organisms respond to their environments. One of our projects seeks to understand how bacteria use a nano-motor to move in response to environmental conditions. This is important because these nano-motors allow bacteria to move towards energy-rich environments for survival and hide from antibiotics during infections. Globally, bacterial infections account for 1 in 8 deaths each year. Currently, antibiotics are our best defense; however, due to factors such as antibiotic misuse/overuse, genetic mutations, and gene transfers, bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to these drugs bacteria are
becoming increasingly resistant to these drugs. There is an urgent need for alternative approaches to combat harmful bacteria.

How does a very small motor direct bacteria? Think of bacteria as tiny boats that have propellors but no rudders. This means that their propellers have to be able to guide the direction. These specialized propellors are called flagella, which resemble Indiana Jones-style whips. Depending on how the bacteria rotate the flagella, these features can both serve to move the bacteria forward and change the direction of swimming. At the base of each of the flagella is a very small and extremely efficient rotary motor that controls this direction of flagellar rotation and is the key to the entire process.

To visualize and understand the inner workings of the bacterial flagellar motor our recent research used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy. We captured and analyzed millions of pictures of these bacterial nano-motors at 100,000-fold magnification. We then combined them to reconstruct models of the different states of the motor which are shown here: https://youtu.be/sGiVNUN2ypg. Our results suggest that the motor uses interlaced cogwheels to change how the flagella rotate and guide the bacteria https://youtu.be/MsPPyNWhqPoh . We can also propose how this nano-motor can accept torque from multiple sources so that bacteria can swim at different speeds (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TLm5aoy3PM).

We are here today on Reddit to answer your questions about our findings, experiences, future directions, and more.

We will be here to take your questions from **12-1PM ET (1600-1700 UTC).** Ask us anything!

Text: Organs cannot be freely donated from one human to another, requiring multiple factors of genetic compatibility between donor and host. Even with a good match, transplant recipients need anti-rejection drugs for the rest of their lives. So why is it that you can't get a heart from a human with a different blood type because your immune system treats that as foreign, but pig cells work fine? Isn't the porcine valve going to be a lot more foreign than any human tissue?

Text: 
So, from my knowledge coal and oil are created from biological materials that were laying deep beneath ground and sea floor under high pressure and temperatures.

From that knowledge i figured that if at some point in history there was life on a planet then sooner or later coal and oil would be created.

But the thing is, that coal and oil are created in different circumstances, time frames(not sure about this one) and places.

So, is there a way for coal to be created but oil not at all or at the very least in very small numbers?

Text: I've been learning about Hadley Cells, and while I generally get the gist of it, the one part I don't understand is why the Coriolis Effect causes the split into 3 cells instead of just one (per hemisphere).

As I understand it, the Coriolis &quot;force&quot; is purely a longitudinal (east/west) effect. As such, it shouldn't have any effect on the north/south component of velocity/momentum/etc. Is this understanding just wrong?

If that is the case, then why should that prevent a mass of air from making the full trip from equator to poll, or vice versa? Sure the direction of travel becomes increasingly deflected, but the the north/south component of that velocity should be unchanged right? What does the longitudinal motion have to do with anything?

Probably, the answer is just animal intuition and/or some type of inborn knowledge, but I wanted to know if any actual studies have been done about how they know which specific spinneret or silk gland to engage.

Text: Recently I had a strange experience. Just before dusk, I spotted a bright star in the sky for 20-30 minutes, completely still the whole time. It was the only star visible at this time, and by far. It was very bright, and appeared to be much farther out than earth's orbit. While outside, more and more satellites came into my view, until I could see at least 20 at once. As it gets darker, more stars appear, but the original bright star that was still begins to start traveling the same direction as the satellites, to the west, slightly north. It was traveling almost the exact same speed as the satellites, but would take occasional pauses in the sky for a few seconds. I did a google search of the ISS location and movement around this time. It was stated as possibly visibly during that week, but was only supposed to be visible for \~10 minutes.

My question, can the ISS stay still in the sky? For 20-30 minutes? And would it be in my view for about an hour total? Can it start and stop moving at will?

Text: Sorry this question is a bit weird. We have a border collie who has so far chewed:

1. A wire on an automatic gate
2. A wire on a pump/water feature
3. The brakes wire on our caravan

But here’s the odd thing. She isn’t much of a chewer, and she stops chewing the wire after it’s disconnected. The pump wire has been severed months ago. The wires are still hanging, if they were fun to play with before, they’re still fun to play with now. Only difference is now there’s no current flowing, so no magnetic field. And she stopped chewing it.

Idk if this helps but I think all of the wires she bit were DC (connected to battery for the van and solar for the gate and pump). So a static magnetic field, same as Earth’s field, although sharks, for example, can still use it to navigate.

All of the sources online are a bit sus, but there’s a lot that claim that dogs can detect magnetic fields, so I was wondering if anyone here had thoughts on whether my dog can detect magnetic fields or if it was just a coincidence.

Text: I read that a difference in sugar (fructose,hexose,etc) distribution is responsible for certain parts of the strawberry being sweeter. Supposedly the distribution of acids (citric and malic acid) is homogeneous throughout the fruit, and the parts with higher sugar concentration balance out the taste of the acids. But is there any evidence that the compounds responsible for the characteristic strawberry taste (other than the sugars and acid) are concentrated in certain parts of the strawberry?

Text: I recently learned that *Oryctolagus cuniculus*, the European rabbit, is considered endangered in its home range. This is the same species which gave rise to the domestic rabbit, which has been introduced elsewhere in the world and become a pervasive introduced species that can disrupt local ecosystems.

I'm curious now how common this is, and what the impacts of these kinds of situations are on conservation projects; I'm also wondering if this may become more common as climate changes and the habitable ranges of plants and animals move outside of their historical ranges.

What kinds of plants and animals are simultaneously endangered in their natural range, and detrimentally invasive in other areas?

Are there any notable examples of species that are fully extirpated from their native range, but where introduced wild populations continue to thrive elsewhere? If so, how do conservationists approach these situations?

Text: Hi everyone! I'm part of several groups who find and repost prehistorical petroglyphs and rock carvings from various areas around the world and many of them seem to show what appear to be stars or other lights in the sky. It occurred to me that over time constellations might change over time and I was curious about A. if they change then how much do they change over several thousand years B. if there are resources about what the sky would have looked like during these time periods. I'd love to know if anyone with a stronger scientific background than me has ever done attempted research into this discipline. If so what is it called? &quot;paleoastronomy&quot; I even lack the language to start my own search into the scientific literature. Playing at deciphering these images is a fun past time for me and I'd get a real kick out of it if I could match up real images carved into rocks with a constellation. All help is very welcome. Thanks in advance!

I know I will get the &quot;motionless compare to what?&quot; and I guess a way we could know we're absolutely motionless is based on time dilatation.
Since every moving object experience a slight time dilatation the absolutely motionless object would not experience the slightest time dilatation.

Text: I was reviewing my public utility bill which includes my water.  I typically never review it, but out of curiosity I was looking at the breakdown of charges. I observed that I pay a $20.00 connection fee for water, but I used so little that my usage did not even equate to a penny.  The same is true of my waste water. 

It occured to me that I have no ince tive to reduce my water consumption (I live in the southwest USA which is under a water crisis).  It seems to me that if my utility removed the connection fee and increased usage fees to compensate that individual households and businesses would be more incentivised to reduce their usage to save money.  Is there any scientific research that backs up my hypothesis? I would like to share that data with my local municipality to try to push them to enact changes to help our city use less water (and potentially enable folks save money.)

Text: I found sources saying that the Pauli Exclusion Principle was more important than electrostatic repulsion for why you can &quot;touch&quot; objects which I don't understand. This implies that Degeneracy Pressure is a kind of &quot;force&quot;, except with no mediating particle.
  

  
This is the way I understand it, suppose you have a region of space filled with electrons. They all repel each other, but you can overcome this repulsion by exerting more and more force. The resistance you feel has absolutely nothing to do with the Pauli Exclusion Principle. However, you will eventually reach a point where you quite literally can't anymore. This is because the Pauli exclusion principle says that any further compression will result in the electrons occupying the same space, which makes no sense since their wave functions are anti-symmetric. It's not a force, but more like a rule of reality that prevents any further compression.

We never hear about Covid or vaccine research in the news anymore. Meanwhile, millions of people are still being infected with it every year, and the most vulnerable are still dying.

Text: Hi. I'm Lisa and I'm a sleep psychologist. I was just on the Washington Post's [&quot;Try This&quot; podcast](https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/try-this/introducing-try-this-/) and also [write columns](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/lisa-strauss/) for the Well+Being section. Looking forward to answering any questions you might have for a longtime practitioner. I love my work and have learned pretty much everything I know from my patients. What really matters is what works for someone in all their individuality.

I started in this field in the 1990s knowing nothing about sleep other than how good it felt and how many psychotherapy patients struggled with it. My boss at the time generously offered me the life-changing job-which I didn't know existed--while we were kibbitzing in the hallway. He might as well have casually suggested that I teach a course on comparative vertebrate morphology. But I learned on the job, and learned through parenting both the toll sleep loss takes and its survivability.  I have increasingly come to appreciate how the disciplines of sleep therapy and psychotherapy inform each other. My practice and the field have evolved a lot since the days of same-old, same-old behavioral advice.

This is of course not a healthcare forum, so any information provided here is for educational purposes only and is not a substitute for personalized, professional care from a qualified healthcare provider. Do consult with a specialist as needed for diagnosis, advice and treatment. Many sleep psychologists and allied professionals can be found through [behavioralsleep.org](https://www.behavioralsleep.org/) or [cbti.directory](https://cbti.directory/). Sleep physicians are usually someone's first stop because they can evaluate for a range of conditions that go beyond the behavioral and psychological.

Was that just wrong information is it actually possible to spread radioactivity into other materials?

I always assumed that if a radioactive object is air tight sealed it doesnt make the room Radioactive.... ofc while the Uranium piece is there you can measure it but as soon as you put it away the room should be completely clean and free of anything but the natural background radiation....

First thought is no, because a new unfilled balloon has nothing in it right?  But it also relates to the atmospheric pressure upon the balloon with regards to its surface area and volume, right?

So when we say “helium is lighter than air”, are we also implying that it is less dense?   So using aeroplanes as an example of higher pressure and lower pressure air acting upon the wings to create lift?

Text: As [COP28, the United Nations Climate Change Conference](https://www.cop28.com/en/), wraps up, stakeholders from around the world are looking to continue ramping up work on solutions to the climate crisis. While the majority of attention goes to anthropogenic contributions, one area that is gaining increased attention is the role of microorganisms in greenhouse gas cycles that are the main source of
climate change.

Join us today, December 12, with panelists coming in throughout the day, for an AMA presented by the American Society for Microbiology focused on microbes and biogeochemistry. We are experts in biogeochemistry from around the world who will answer your questions and discuss the role the world's smallest living organisms have in climate change contributions (and solutions). We'll discuss impacts of microbial metabolisms on the nitrogen cycle, contributions to methane production and consumption, and effects on levels of carbon dioxide. Ask us anything!

Text: If you look up the definitions today, a second is defined as the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of a caesium-133 atom's… vibration (I suppose?) while the meter is defined as the distance travelled by light in 1 / 299,792,458 seconds.

These definitions were definitely never taught to me in school, growing up. I guess I never asked enough questions as a kid, and just accepted second to be 1 / 60 of a minute, which is 1 / 60 of an hour, which is 1 / 24 of a day, while meter is pretty much the length stated by every ruler I've ever owned.

What if a kid is to ask me these questions today, though? Or if my future kid asks it? How and why is a second a second, or a meter is a meter? How do I explain these things in a way a kid can relate to, without going into what's caesium, or what's caesium-133, or why caesium, or why 9,192,631,770?

The meter is definitely something I'll grapple with too. I accepted the meter for what it is in day-to-day life before I learnt the speed of light in school, so the concept of defining the meter according to the distance travelled by light feels extremely circular-logic-ish in my head.

What's the accepted layman, non-pedantic definitions for SI units (not just second and meter) commonly used in day-to-day life, in terms which is relatable in day-to-day contexts?

One might hypothesise that some kind of spatial processing ability enabled by vision is a precondition to developing echolocation. It seems somewhat reasonable, since echolocation seems a lot 'simpler', relying only on mechanical phenomena rather than the complex photochemistry and optics necessary for vision. It does seem strange that bats and dolphins are the only animals I can name which possess this ability, both of which are mammals. Are there any examples of a species which rely on similar methods as a sense?

Text: Hi everyone. Learning about electromagnetism in physics. Not sure if I’m crazy, but do we really gloss over why a magnetic field points north to be clockwise around a current carrying wire? Do we know anything more about how or why it points clockwise other than “that’s just how it goes.”

For background, this came up when doing Oersted’s “compass experiment.” The compass sat idle pointing to earth’s north. Then current is suddenly run through the above wire and the north of the compass snaps from the earth’s north into a position *always* pointing north as clockwise relative to the direction of current (right hand rule direction).

So we know by experiment that this true. But do we know how it’s true, or is it more of a ‘brute force’ fact? It’s this *always* that gets me.

And the fact it’s so clear through such a simple experiment - compass points to the earth’s north, current is run through wire, compass snaps into north as clockwise, *always clockwise,* to the direction of convention current in wire.

Thanks all!


Tldr: Why does a magnetic field around a current-carrying wire always point clockwise, as observed in Oersted's compass experiment?

Text: Before COVID I didn't really have any concept of &quot;viral load&quot;, I thought that getting infected with a virus was a very binary thing - you get exposed to the virus and you're sick, or you don't get exposed and you aren't.

Now I understand that *how much* of the virus you get exposed to can determine how sick you get. If I got drenched in the face by a sneeze from someone with a high COVID load (funny story: my first COVID infection, I believe, began with a sneeze in the face from my infected 2yo son), I would get a lot sicker than if I my exposure had been much lighter.

Is it this way for all viruses?

Like, with HIV, would I get sicker much faster and progress to AIDS much sooner, if my initial exposure was to a much larger amount of virus?

tldr; question is, do all viral infections vary in intensity according to the magnitude of the exposure? Or are some more &quot;binary&quot;? 

Bonus question:
Is there some concept of &quot;critical viral load&quot;, like, if I get a single HIV viron in my bloodstream, there's a chance it will never find a host and the infection will never happen (right?). But if there are 1000, infection is a certainty (right?). So there's a 'critical value' somewhere in-between (right?). How does this vary for different viruses - are some more *virulent* than others?

Title: Do we have any evidence or ideas if the ancient Indo-Europeans may have brought potential zoonotic or other diseases to new environments that contributed to their impact on native hunter-gatherers in the new lands they went to?

Text: It seems that there was, in some locations such as Europe, a large-scale 'replacement' of native populations by Yamnaya or Indo-Europeans. The closest analogue in modern times we have is the European peopling of the Americas, with diseases like Smallpox being a huge component to the course of events. Could smallpox, itself, have been responsible? Would it have had a significant impact on urbanized centers during the Bronze age that may have contributed to the worldwide 'Bronze Age Collapse'?

Even more so now since COVID, I find the idea of how disease has impacted human culture so fascinating and underappreciated. I'd love to learn more about it.

Title: Why does hair loss only seem to target our heads while hair growth increases everywhere else on the body?

Text: The paradox of hair loss is that while we seem to lose the hair on our heads, it tends to increase everywhere else on our bodies.

Many men entering their 40s and 50s will develop baldness. That said, they paradoxically seem to gain body hair in other place. Some examples of this may be thicker beards or ear hair or thicker chest and back hair.

My question is why does the process which causes hair loss on the tops of our heads not impact hair on the rest of our bodies? It seems like we start off young with a full head of hair and lack of body hair. Then we lose our hair and our bodies go into hair growth overdrive.

Is there an answer as to why?

[The article mentions that 10 of the edits were to reduce the odds of rejection](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/first-pig-kidney-transplant-human-rcna144273), but nearly 60 edits were to &quot;reduce risk of infection from viruses&quot;.   


How do gene edits prevent viral infection?  If the concern is a porcine CMV virus, wouldn't it simply be a case of if the kidney/tissue has an active infection, or not? As in, if the donated kidney was free from from the virus...what good do the additional gene edits accomplish?

Text: Hi Reddit! We are a group of lactation/human milk/breastfeeding researchers. In honor of [World Breastfeeding Week](https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-breastfeeding-week/2024), we are here to answer your burning questions about babies, boobs, and breastmilk!

Lactation science is fraught with social complexity. In recent years, tensions between [researchers](https://theconversation.com/breastfeeding-research-improves-lives-and-advances-health-but-faces-conflicts-151820), advocates &amp; [industry](https://www.thelancet.com/series/Breastfeeding-2023) have reached a crescendo that impacts both our work and the lived experiences of breastfeeding families. We believe that this science belongs to everyone, and that engaging the public on this topic is an important part in addressing these challenges. Science should never make anyone feel bad, but instead should inspire awe and curiosity!

World Breastfeeding Week is a global event held in the first week of August every year, supported by WHO, UNICEF and many government and civil society partners. The theme for 2024 is &quot;Closing the gap: Breastfeeding support for all.&quot; WBW celebrates ALL breastfeeding journeys, no matter what it looks like for you, while showcasing the ways families, societies, communities and health workers can have breastfeeding parents' backs. In recent years, public health experts have been moving from simply &quot;promoting&quot; breastfeeding toward &quot;protecting, promoting, and supporting&quot; breastfeeding-that is, emphasizing the role of the entire community in creating the conditions that make breastfeeding easier, more accessible, and sustainable for all families who want it.

Today's group hails from biochemistry, epidemiology, microbiology, neonatology, family medicine, nursing, epigenetics, and biological anthropology. We can answer your questions in English, Portuguese, Italian, Farsi, Sinhalese, and Hindi.

We will join from **11-2pm CST / 12-3pm EST (16-19 UT)**. Ask us anything!

EDIT: THANK YOU for your thoughtful questions everybody!! We learned a lot, and had SO MUCH FUN! A few of us commented to each other how thoughtful and informed the questions were! When you spend a lot of time with a topic every day, it’s easy to get a bit up in your head about it, so this was really helpful for us to take a step back and get a sense of what the wider public is thinking about with regards to our work. You gave us a lot to think about, and even got us thinking about future research questions to pursue!  

Some of us will hang back a bit past our “official” end time (3PM EST), and some of us will pop in out throughout the rest of the day and answer any stragglers.

World Breastfeeding Week continues through the 7th (Wed), but that won’t be the end of what is a more than month-long party!

Are the outer layers of the star dense enough to decay the orbit of the planet, sending it spiraling toward the core of the star? Does the gravity of the planet carve out a bizarre hill sphere of dense stellar atmosphere around the planet? What might be the difference between the orbital velocity of the planet and the rotational speed of the stellar atmosphere at that distance? When the star collapses to a white dwarf, is it possible the planet has survived somewhat intact?

What I mean specifically is, they can determine meteroid impacts from tens of thousands of years ago, (like the younger Dryas impact) by finding samples of Iridium in the soil, which they know came from outer space and was not already here in our soil. 

How do we know for example Iridium is from outer space... What was the line of investigation that lead to this firm agreed upon understanding, for any element / metal?

Text: I wasn’t sure whether to tag this physics or chemistry. 

Hard to describe without a photo being allowed, but when pouring a liquid from one vessel to another, it seems that as the stream of liquid falls, it gets narrower. 

Refilling the hand wash dispenser from a bottle of refill, the higher I lift the refill bottle from the dispenser, the narrower the stream becomes (and the easier it is to get it into the filler hole).

As Professor Julius Sumner Miller would ask - “Why is it so?”

Text: NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft [experienced a serious problem](https://blogs.nasa.gov/voyager/2024/03/15/engineers-working-to-resolve-issue-with-voyager-1-computer/) in November 2023 and mission leaders weren't sure they'd be able to get it working again. A failed chip in one of the onboard computers caused the spacecraft to stop sending any science or engineering data, so the team couldn't even see what was wrong. It was like trying to fix a computer with a broken screen.

But over the course of six months, a crack team of experts from around [JPL brought Voyager 1 back from the brink.](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-voyager-1-resumes-sending-engineering-updates-to-earth) The task involved sorting through old documents from storage, working in a software language written in the 1970s, and lots of collaboration and teamwork. Oh, and they also had to deal with the fact that Voyager 1 [is 15 billion miles (24 billion km) from Earth](https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status/), which means it takes a message almost a full day to reach the spacecraft, and almost a full day for its response to come back.

Now, NASA's longest running mission can continue. [Voyager 1 and its twin Voyager 2](https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/) are the only spacecraft to ever send data back from interstellar space - the space between stars. By directly sampling the particles, plasma waves, and magnetic fields in this region, scientists learn more about the Sun's protective bubble that surrounds the planets, and the ocean of material that fills most of the Milky Way galaxy.

Text: Hello r/AskScience!

Joining us are Lucas Eastham, M.S., Priera Panescu, Ph.D., and Bryan Quoc Le, Ph.D., who are here to answer all your questions about upcycling agricultural &quot;leftovers&quot; for the production of alternative proteins.

**Upcycling sidestreams is a critical step toward creating circular bioeconomies that produce food more efficiently, affordably, and sustainably.** The [Good Food Institute](https://gfi.org/) (GFI), a nonprofit think tank working to make the global food system better for the planet, people, and animals, recently released a new report, &quot;[Cultivating alternative proteins from commodity crop sidestreams](https://gfi.org/resource/cultivating-alternative-proteins-from-commodity-crop-sidestreams/).&quot; Find the GFI Sidestreams analysis report [here](https://gfi.org/resource/cultivating-alternative-proteins-from-commodity-crop-sidestreams/) and webinar [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5HMeQzRU34).

The report identifies sidestreams (&quot;leftovers&quot;) that have tremendous potential to maximize food production via alternative proteins, while also reducing the costs and environmental impacts of agricultural waste. Specifically, this analysis identifies the optimal sidestreams candidates from North America's top crops that could be valorized for (1) protein concentrates for plant-based food ingredients, (2) protein hydrolysates for fermentation or cultivated meat media, and (3) lignocellulosic sugars for fermentation media.

This analysis highlights the major challenges associated with bringing these sidestreams into commercial use for the food industry. It also outlines strategic geographic opportunity areas and the need for public-private partnerships to fully exploit the economic and environmental potential sidestreams offer. Ultimately, the report aims to provide a landscape and actionable insights that commercial, non-profit, and public sector stakeholders can use to direct their efforts in building a sustainable, circular bioeconomy in the food industry.

[Lucas Eastham](https://gfi.org/team/lucas-eastham/) (/u/lucase-GFI) is a Senior Fermentation Scientist at The Good Food Institute, and previously worked for 10 years in microbial biotechnology bioprocess development for biofuels, biofertilizers, food ingredients, and cosmetic ingredients.

[Dr. Priera Panescu](https://gfi.org/team/priera-panescu/) (/u/Chemical_Preaction) is a Lead Scientist at The Good Food Institute. She is focused on analyzing plant-based meat and proteins, and how to expedite their progress. Prior to GFI, she spent nearly a decade working on polymer, formulation, and materials chemistry research.

Text: Both Hawaii (the big island, anyway) and Iceland have significant volcanic activity, but Hawaii doesn't seem to have the level of geothermal energy availability that Iceland does.

Iceland has major percentages of its electricity and heating needs met through geothermal power. Hot springs abound, and are readily located throughout the country. 

Hawaii doesn't have any hot springs that I'm aware of. I know they've had some geothermal power plants before, but it's nowhere near as widespread as Iceland. 

What's different about these two? On the surface they seem like they should have similar features.

Text: I understand escape velocity is the velocity at which an object needs to be travelling to 'escape' another object's gravity, given no other forces are acting on it.

But, the range of gravity is infinite, it just falls off at the square of distance. So no matter how far away the escaping object is, it will always feel some small pull back towards the object it's escaping, even if it's infinitessimal. Therefore given enough time and obviously no other object to capture it, it will fall back even if its initial velocity was above escape velocity.

Is escape velocity an approximation given the realities of the universe (at some point the gravitational pull is so small it will be captured by another object) or have I missed something?

EDIT: Thank you for all the great answers, I understand this now. I should learn calculus.

Like if you search up a diagram of an earthquake, you will see that one side of the fault will move, usually going up. Or both sides will move in opposite directions while still colliding (ie one going north and one going south)

But isn’t that only possible with interplate earthquakes? Because how can 2 sides of a fault be moving if there inside a tectonic plate?

Text: Hello, folks!

I have two quick questions about gravitational waves. Let me say up top, I realize that there's not much we know about them, so I'm perfectly satisfied with 'best guess' answers here. Obviously if there *is* a known correct answer, that's best, but if not, an answer that seems to logically make sense given what we *do* know will work fine!

Now, for the questions!

1. Do gravitational waves diminish over time? Or, rather, do the distortions they cause diminish over time (and space)? Do they start to fade like a ripple in a pond, or do they maintain their level of distorting spacetime as they expand?
2. What is your best guess for how a strong gravitational wave might affect a human body? Would it just kinda pass through a person without being noticed, since it's distorting spacetime and the person is inside spacetime? Or would you feel it, kinda like a pressure wave? Would its effects likely be more macro or micro in scope? What would be your best guess as to how this would affect a human body - or, what might you compare it to? Any medical conditions you might compare it to?

Again, I realize that there's probably very little information to go on, so if we have to resort to conjecture, I'm comfortable with that, but I'd like to base our conjecture on as reasonable information and/or assumptions as possible. So! What do you all think?

Text: ASTM E595 outlines the process to test and requirements required to pass outgassing for space and other critical systems. It is generally considered the “standard” for all outgassing testing criteria, at least in my field. 

What I am struggling to understand is why the TML (total mass loss) is adjusted down based on the WVR (water vapor recovered)? 

The process states that the test sample will be exposed to a 50% RH environment for 24 hours then put into the test environment, which is some X hours at some T temperature (can’t remember exactly what these values are). 

The mass lost in the test environment relative to the mass after the 24hr exposure to 50% RH is the TML. 

Afterwards, there is an “optional” step where the sample is re-exposed to the same 50% RH environment for 24hrs and its mass is measured again. The mass regained can then be deducted from the previously calculated TML to get the adjusted value. 

Why is this allowed? Does outgassing in space not care about water vapor? If so, why not? 

Edit: to any one who is curious: I reached out to the ASTM standards people and got a response from the engineers responsible for outgassing standards and she said that they allow for the exclusion of WVR for the same reasons that SAE standard allows for the reduction of TMR (I may have gotten the acronyms wrong, sorry I’m drinking lol). 

That is, water vapor is reduced in *some* but not all cases because generally speaking water vapor is not considered to be a major contaminant in space applications. I believe this is due to the fact that small amounts of water will sublimate in space and so it will not cause condensation issues and will simply dissipate into space. 

However, it is ultimately up to the client/customer to determine whether or not they approve of the use of WVR to meet the 1% TML standard.

Text: Regardless of if it's a probiotic supplement, or if it's just a food touted to contain probiotics, it always seems to be genus Lactobacillus. For example, L. Casei (and L. Casei Shirota), L. Acidophilus, L. delbrueckii, L. kefiranofaciens, all found in various foods and supplements.

Does the human gut flora not require any other genus? Are there other subsets of probiotics (both food and supplement) that I'm just not aware of that contain other genera?

Text: I've read claims that processed foods are responsible for alot of inflammation, among other claims that they're generally awful for you.

So I looked up the definition of processed(being that it means any transformation from the food's natural state) and it seems like such a broad label that any one health claim about *all* foods in that category would stretch belief.

Now, obviously there are foods out there that are WAY more processed than other foods. Synthesizing Cheese Whiz in a lab is going to be very different from slicing a carrot and the cheese whiz is going to be way less healthy for reasons that are likely related to it being more processed but that doesnt really help my understanding.

Hope my question's clear, please let me know if I need to be more specific.

Text: I know in general that when things go wrong that the body can and that is basically how we can get cancers or invasive scaring, but in general, how does the body know not to go haywire? For instance, when a tooth breaks, the gum tries to heal and seal over the broken bits if left untreated in the gum. Why doesn't this happen to our teeth in general, then? When we get a cut or burn, the wound seals, but even if it is bad, such as a whole hand injury, you generally don't get fingers fusing together. I would attribute some to movement, but this doesn't solve every case. There are people that can't eat or talk and their teeth are normal. There are people that are immobilize after serious injury and they heal normally. Is dna really that complex that it knows how to heal a finger, an arm, that it knows when to stop the healing process and when to reactivate it? Is there not an answer yet and that is why we can't trigger these mechanisms ourselves to grow new limbs for instance?

Text: I have recently learned that the queens of honey bee colonies can live for several years, while most worker bees in the same colony typically only live for a few months (depending on the season, and assuming everything goes right).

That got me wondering, what other species have similar or even greater differences in lifespan within the same species? I assume this phenomenon is really only present in less complex organisms and eusocial colonies (and various dog breeds, I suppose), but I would love to be pleasantly surprised!

Text: Most birds have a very unusual and particular way of moving--you know, lots of swift, jerky movements, particularly the head when they're looking around. Mammals, even small ones that might occupy the same sorts of niches as some small birds, move much more smoothly. Why is that? Is it something to do with their musculature, or differences in the nervous system, or evolutionary pressures (probably), or what? 

A bonus question: do scientists think that dinosaurs moved similarly? So would a t-rex jerk its head around like a chicken or an ostrich?

Text: Some background and then details on my specific case:

When people record live music, there's typically a few things they carry in their kit: 1) a microphone (in some cases a pair of electret mics), 2) a &quot;battery box&quot; which provides power to the mics and passes the signal through to a 3) recording device.  Most recording devices also have their own &quot;mic level&quot; power, but &quot;tapers&quot; highly recommend using a battery box and turning off the power from the recorder if possible.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are: what does a battery box do and is it really important in my setup described below?  Is there anything I can do to improve my design, like using different resistors - i.e., would 3-6K resistors (or even lower) be better?

In my case, I'm making my own &quot;battery box&quot; using info available online.  It basically has [this](https://i.imgur.com/SUswVO6.jpg) layout.  I am using a 12v (21/23) battery and 9.1K resistors, along with capacitors of sizes ranging from 22pF to 1uF (I've built several on the premise that the 22pF caps help provide bass roll-off, while the 1uF do not).  I kinda understand the purpose of the caps (at least in theory), but it's the resistors that I'm confused about, and ultimately how important the battery box is in this setup.

When measuring the inherent &quot;mic level&quot; output of my recorder (a Roland R-07), I see 2v and what looks like \~0.015ma.  This would directly feed the mics in the absence of a battery box.

With the battery box (12v battery + 9.1K resistors), I see 12v and \~0.10ma.

The electret mics I'm using typically have 2.2K impedance, require 1-10V, and use ~0.5mA max current.  A schematic of one set of mics I'm using is found [here](https://i.imgur.com/aibNo3C.jpg).  I've tried some prototypes of both the mics and the battery box out, and the recordings sound fine when recording volumes loud enough to require ear plugs - no clipping or anything, but I wonder what the resistors are doing and if the 9.1K ones I've chosen are the best for this application.

E: corrected some values. 

Thanks in advance for any help!

Title: The chemical composition of a whisky changes as it matures and develops new congeners. Is it feasible to analyze the aged whiskey and then synthetically mature a young whisky by adding in the identified congeners?

Text: Its my understanding (please correct me if Im wrong) that the difference between diluted ethanol and an alcoholic drink (say whisky) is the presence of congeners - a complex mix of dissolved compounds that develop during production and maturation. Break-down of fermentation/distillation products and the acquisition of solutes present in the oak casks, result in a highly complex mixture of compounds. These compounds, collectively referred to as congeners are what determine the taste/smell of the whisky. The abundance/concentration of various individual congeners is what separates Lagavulin from Laphroaig and more broadly, what separates different kinds of whisk(e)ys.

Lets say you have a well equipped anal chem lab and unlimited time/money. You acquire a bottle of Lagavulin just before its casked, analyze it and then 16y later obtain a bottle from the same cask for comparison. Are modern spectrometry and other analytical techniques advanced enough to confidently identify the precise composition/identity of congeners present in each bottle?

If so, is it possible to isolate (or alternatively, synthesize) the individual congeners in the mature bottle and then add them to the pre-cask whisky (at the measured concentrations) to &quot;instantly&quot; mature it? Or is the chemistry during maturation too complex to define and/or reproduce accurately?

Or better yet, as a pipe dream develop a lyophilized &quot;congener concentrate&quot;  (ideally one free of histamine and other biogenic amines) that one could reconstitute with ethanol+water.

Obviously the cost effectiveness in either case would be questionable. But if you had best proc dev team on earth and could consistently isolate/reconstitute the congeners at large scales, I'd wager it could reap huge profits over the long term.

Text: Tortoiseshell cats have a different melanin allele on each X chromosome. Why do we see what appear to be lines or patterns of fur coloration? 

One X chromosome is inactivated by Lyonization and becomes a Barr Body, the other is expressed. The expressed melanin allele determines the color of the fur produced by the cell.

When a somatic cell divides, the daughter cells express the *same activated X*, and *suppress the same X in the Barr Body*, so the color of the fur of daughter cells is the same its parent cell. 

So we *shouldn't* expect to see a coat where the fur colors are expressed uniformly at random  from the set of two possible alleles.

We should expect contiguous &quot;islands&quot; of coloration, from all spacially adjacent descendent cells divided from the earliest progenitor cells, which progenitors selected an X at random to supress.

*So finally the question: But why do we also see what appear to be lines or patterns?*

 Differential growth rates of the descendent somatic cells? Die offs of certain cell lineages? Is this mostly determined in utero or can it change over the lifetime of the animal?

Text: I know that the differing red/black color is due to differing X chromosome inactivation, and that the white color is due to the piebald gene altering the migration of pigment producing cells across the body, but how do these interact? Why is it that in an individual cat, there’s bigger patches of color next to white spots but it’s more brindled farther away? Is the white spot stopping the spread of one color but not another? I’m guessing it isn’t actually doing anything with the X activation or gene expression and instead is about the physical movement of pigment or how the cells divide, but Im not sure exactly how it works. 

Mostly I guess I just want to know how the pigment cells spread over the body to make patterns in animals.

That made me curious about that undescribed 4,000. Presumably, to come to a hypothetical number of undiscovered minerals we must have worked out what their theoretical chemical composition and crystalline structure are, right?

If so, and if we're able to synthesize minerals like diamonds, has science tried synthesizing any of these hypothetical minerals? Have we had success in it?

Looking into the question a bit, I do understand that the technical definition of minerals as naturally occurring makes the answer from that standpoint an automatic &quot;that's impossible&quot;. I'm having a slight bit of trouble reconciling that with synthetic diamonds and all that, but I hope that people are alright with extending a little bit of definitional leeway here since I'm specifically thinking about those theoretically naturally occurring minerals.

Is it to do with planetary alignment not being right to sling outt that far, or depsite modern advancements in instruments we wouldn't learn anything more than the 1st two already have?

Text: Electrical ground seemed simple at first, but the more I've studied electronics the less I've understood it.   
Examples of confusion are:  


The earth, dirt, seems pretty insulating. If I touch an electric fence wearing rubber boots, I wont be shocked, but without those boots I should be. What makes rubber such a better insulator than dirt to prevent me from being shocked? How can electricity travel to the &quot;ground&quot; when the ground (earth) is non metallic?

A 3 phase delta generator, going through a rectifier, to a load, to ground, according to my teacher will have no current going through it since the ground doesn't connect back to the delta generator. Why must the current return to the generator, couldn't it dissipate into &quot;ground&quot;.   
A DC circuit I can understand needing to complete the loop, however with AC it seems like I should be able to generate electricity, send it out somewhere, without the need for return.   


Ground has been defined as 0 volts. A car chassis is connected to &quot;ground&quot;. If I then connect the car to the earth, does the car chassis no longer have exactly 0 volts, since the earth is *more ground?*

Text: Tall people are believed to have low longevity, potentially because they may be more likely to have cancer (more cell replications) and because their heart has to work harder.

What about muscular people? They also have more cells to maintain, and their body is bigger.

Building muscles is believed to have many benefits: lower diabetes risks, better musculoskeletal functions, etc.
Having said that, do those benefits cancel out with the similar low-longevity risks that tall people have?

Text: Hi Reddit! I am a biologist from the University of Maryland here to answer your questions about aging. My research has focused on the molecular mechanisms of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), a premature aging disease, and the potential connections between HGPS and normal aging.

**Kan Cao** is a renowned scientist, anti-aging authority and professor of cell biology and molecular genetics at the University of Maryland. She has been studying human aging and in particular the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome (HGPS), a premature aging disease that claims most victims by age 13. While conducting research on aging and HGPS, Kan's lab discovered that a common dye, methylene blue, had incredible anti-aging properties for human skin. With support from UM Ventures, she started Mblue Labs and launched Bluelene Skincare, the first commercially available methylene blue anti-aging cream.

I'll be on from **1 to 3 p.m. ET (17-18 UT)** - ask me anything!

Text: I was wondering, what if the tilt of the Earth with respect to the Sun was fixed somehow - so, for example, we take its tilt on December 21 and so, now, Earth is tilted North-away from the Sun forever.

I was thinking about how it gets colder in winter since the winter hemisphere is tilted away from the Earth (and vice-versa for summer) - but then it starts to tilt back again after the Solstice (since the Earth's axial tilt is actually fixed with respect to, I dunno, &quot;space&quot;), and so the cooling stops and things start warming up again. If the tilt were fixed, how much colder would the winter hemisphere get? How much hotter would the summer hemisphere get? How close do we get to whatever the &quot;equilibrium winter/summer&quot; would be?

*I know this is impossible*, I know that it would require the Earth's rotation to actually constantly be changing, which couldn't happen and would cause some other maybe catastrophic things to happen if you were to somehow force it to happen. I really just want to understand about just how far the whole &quot;getting colder/warmer as we move towards the solstices&quot; thing could go, hypothetically.

Thanks!

Text: In light of the seeming extinction of the Influenza B/Yamagata lineage, the WHO recommended in September that “the inclusion of a B/Yamagata antigen as a component of influenza vaccines is no longer warranted, and every effort should be made to exclude it as soon as possible.&quot;

The response to this has been that the flu vaccine market is shifting back to the trivalent vaccine used up until QIVs were introduced. The WHO has also acknowledged that additional support will be needed for manufacturers who currently only make quadrivalent vaccines to pivot to making trivalent vaccines.

However, my question is -- if we're already prepared to produce quadrivalent vaccines, why don't we take the &quot;slot&quot; opened by B/Yamagata to immunize for a third variety of Influenza A? For example, the Northern &amp; Southern hemisphere currently have different recommendations for the H3N2 vaccine component. Wouldn't it make more sense to have both H3N2 varieties packaged together and utilize the existing technology for a quadrivalent vaccine?

Text: Isn't part of knowing something is invasive is because we have a somewhat current record of what species belong where? Thus, any deviation from the present status and an introduction of a new plant or animal into an existing system we can identify as invasive?   


Example: If we stumbled on island A and we identified a certain new creature, we wouldn't know if it arrived there last month, last year, last decade, or it's native to that island since forever. Further, what if we stumbled on another island, not necessarily close by the first island, and there we also found the same creature. How would we know that this creature was a native of island B versus an invader from island A, or vice versa (a native of Island A, and an invader on Island B)?   


If the creature on one island was fluorishing, does that make them invasive? What if the creature did end up on Island B from Island A somehow, but on Island B, they were languishing, not fluorishing? Would they still be invasive, even if they weren't thriving, and would likely die out?

Text: It is a common concept in my country that people who are born and raised in villages have better immunity and are better at fighting contagious infections/allergies because they have been exposed to multiple antigens/pathogens through unhygienic environment, dust etc in rural areas and hence have better immune responses to wide variety of pathogens/allergens. Or is that just a myth??

Text: I was reading about measuring the stability of oscillators and measuring their accuracy; but I didn't see anything about how we measure the frequency stability of the most stable clocks. I'm talking about things like Strontium lattice clocks here. 

If I have a quartz crystal oscillator I can compare it to a GPS disciplined rubidium or cesium oscillator; but how do they measure the accuracy over various time intervals for clocks which are more accurate than anything else?

Text: In the present, to my understanding, oxygen in the atmosphere is produced by plants, which do so using carbon dioxide, and that phytoplankton were the primary cause of the massive jump in atmospheric oxygen content that happened during the Archean. My question, is that given that there were basically only single celled organisms on earth, where did the oxygen come from in the first place? Is it bonded in rocks and trapped in the crust, and the phytoplankton were able to free it? Was it dissolved in the ocean? Was it somehow transported from another part of the galaxy such as in an meteor? Was there significantly more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere? And if there was carbon dioxide, where did that come? Were there mono cellular organisms on earth already undergoing cellular respiration, and if so, where did they get the oxygen to do so in the first place?

Then if everything else goes well, then of the 4 resulting daughter cells, 2 of them would have n chromosomes, and the other 2 would have n+1 chromosomes. But I wasn't able to find anything about it online.

Text: I was thinking about how trains stop, the engineer pulls a lever which releases air from the brakes, which makes the wheels slow down.

Intuitively longer trains take longer to stop because they have a lot more momentum, but obviously they also have more wheels and brakes. I'm guessing that a 100 car train will have the same &quot;brake to weight&quot; ratio as a 10 car train.

I read that the delay between the lever being pulled and the air being released toward the back of the train contribute to the braking distance. Before the last car even starts braking the train has already moved forward. 

But in a perfect system where all of the brakes are applied at the same time, would a train with 100 cars take longer to stop than one with 10 cars? Assuming each individual car has the same mass and braking force. After all if you had 100 semi trucks driving on a motorway and had them brake at the same time, they'd stop within the same distance as a single semi would. Is that the same for trains?

Text: I started thinking about this phenomenon because of the total solar eclipse that had place on April 8, 2024 and was visible in the US and Mexico. I'm from Poland and I wanted to check when I will be able to see such an eclipse in my country but to my disappointment the next one will take place in 2135, so needless to say I won't be able to witness it. I started going through Polish Wikipedia only to discover a weird pattern - every few centuries there is one century with 4 total eclipses and then there is either one, two, or none in the other centuries. You can see the dates below:

- March 20, 1140
- September 4, 1187
- June 26, 1321
- June 16, 1406
- June 7, 1415
- June 26, 1424
- March 16, 1485
- January 24, 1544
- August 12, 1654
- September 23, 1699
- May 12, 1706
- May 13, 1733
- November 19, 1816
- July 8, 1842
- July 28, 1851
- August 19, 1887
- June 30, 1954

There were 4 total eclipses in the 15th and 19th century, one in 20th and there will be none this century. I know that it is for sure connected with the Earth rotations, but how exactly? What is the precise explanation? Does the Earth somehow position certain hemispheres differently every given time period and then this hemisphere/ region experiences more total solar eclipses? Is there a scientific name for such a position and what it is? Are there certain requirements that have to happen to experience more solar eclipses in a certain region? I'd be grateful for any kind of info.

Because of this the atmosphere receives more radiation, then, the amount of nitrogen that becomes carbon 14 and is deposited in living beings also increased over time?

Taking into account that the carbon 14 deposited in the current and ancient organism has the same ''age'' at the time of the animal's death in their respective periods.

Everytime I drink coffee and have ice floating at the top, it never travels towards my lips, no matter how close my lips are to the surface of the water, the dam ice cubes never come closer. Why is the water being pulled from the bottom of the cup instead of the top. Wouldn't it make sense to have the water being sucked up later by layer so to speak?

TLDR why does ice not rush to your lips when sipping coffee.

Text: I am writing a book and want to have a &quot;natural&quot; disaster scenario where a group of villages are at the base of a mountain that has recieved heavy snowfall in the middle of winter and the mountain heats up from inside (its a fantasy novel so not a natural occurence). While it is a fantasy novel I do prefer to keep stuff like this accurate so was wondering what would actually occur as the mountain heats up in as much detail as possible.

I can clarify if needed but these are the factors I know will be relevant:

1. Heavy snowfall (let's say 4.5 feet)

2. Mountain heating up from near the base

3. Relatively conical mountain

Thanks for all the help everyone! I think I got a good basis to make everything work and be at the very least not so far off it doesn't make sense.

Text: I was thinking about this and realised that it’s probably curtailed by a couple of factors: 

1. Their orbital periods are much longer and therefore passing through areas of dust happens on a lower frequency than earth 
2. The density of comets off gassing and emitting dust is lower at distance given the weakened sun power. 

Therefore, I wonder if it is much lower in likelihood. However, do planets such as Uranus and Neptune experience meteors and other ‘shooting stars’ like we do at all?

Text: So I bought this [light](https://hokolite.com/collections/rechargeable-work-light/products/three-head-construction-led-work-light) to use for climbing at night. The light itself is great and while it doesn't seem like 8000 lumens it does the job plenty well. The unexpected issue I ran into is that on camera the light causes flickering that just about ruins any video I take with them. My guess is that the hz of the light is dropping below the frame rate of the camera. What I don't understand is that doing testing I can use 60fps recording just fine until about 1m15s of the light being on, then the flickering begins. Once the flickering begins I can't even run 30fps recording without it being horrible. I'm able to repeat this every single time on multiple of these lights. What could be causing the light to be operating above 60hz for the first minute but then drop below 30hz thereafter every single time?
  

  
It is a battery operated light but I see this issue regardless of the charge. I will say it is substantially worse on my GoPro 9/mirrorless camera vs my galaxy s21 for the same frame rates but I'm guessing samsung has some kind of smoothing AI it uses that is the cause for that difference. Looking for input on both why that could be happening and if there is anything I can potentially do to fix it (unlikely I know)

Text: (Somewhat specific question that I wasn’t sure where to ask and couldn’t find info on elsewhere, tis the respiratory virus season 🦠🎁 thank you in advance!) 

If someone knows they have covid, they’ll often take the rapid home tests until they show up negative to know they’re in the clear. Can the rapid flu tests pharmacies offer be used in the same way?

I know early on covid pcr tests would show positives for longer than the rapid tests, are flu tests like this as well? Can’t find info on how long flu is detectable on tests or how those tests work!

Text: I am referring to several different phenomenon (at least I think it’s several), so I will link and describe each.

[These](https://www.google.com/maps/place/-23.711641,+120.269599/@-23.7119651,120.2701462,16z/data=!3m1!1e3!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d-23.7116409!4d120.2695991)
I’ve searched far and wide and cannot seem to find any answers. They don’t appear to be the sand ridges of the Simpson desert, they look drastically different, some look like the first picture looks (I see many of these when flying overhead) like off-road tracks/manmade clearing - however they certainly are not as they almost never link to a road, yet are clearly gaps in foliage
Are these survey lines? Mine suitability testing? Maybe even the remains of roads of a ghost town/telegraph line towns?

[These](https://www.google.com/maps/place/23%C2%B010'37.4%22S+122%C2%B033'54.8%22E/@-23.1736845,122.5835532,12z/data=!3m1!1e3!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d-23.1770556!4d122.5652222)

These look like wind erosion to me, however it seems strange to me as looking at wind maps it seems to be heading in the wrong direction/doesn’t correlate with wind patterns (I could be wrong, I’m not meteorologists)

[These](https://www.google.com/maps/place/21%C2%B039'57.7%22S+119%C2%B025'39.1%22E/@-21.6660278,119.4275278,16z/data=!3m1!1e3!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d-21.6660278!4d119.4275278)
This one just baffles me. It’s a huge long hill? It could not possibly be manmade, but there’s no reason for it to have formed the way it does?

I’m actually mostly interested in the first link, as I’ve seen many of those. 
Thanks for the help guys!

As a specific example, I'm interested in horses in America. Are those abundant in fossil record before they are thought to have died out??

In general, I am under the impression that for some species at least, fossils aren't very abundant at all, so I wonder how one could conclude that a species died out X thousand years ago if fossils were rare to begin with. Maybe because the preconditions for fossilization weren't there, or the population was small, or other reasons.

But then why isn't this the case with humans and UV or Infrared light? As far as I can tell, based on that logic, we should be able to see solely UV light right? In a UV-lit room, we should still be able to see, albeit dimmer and without color. But as far as I can find, this isn't the case.

Text: So, if we pretend there is no air/atmosphere, it seems like a projectile launched exactly vertically will always land in the same spot. This makes sense for things like a baseball, an arrow, or even a bullet shot out of a gun. But what happens when we really push the envelope and say hypothetically we shoot something straight up at a wicked initial velocity of, lets say, 15,000 m/s. The projectile will travel several thousand miles above the surface of the earth, until gravitational acceleration eventually overcomes the initial velocity and it falls back to the earth. Will it land in the exact same spot?? Or because the earth is rotating, will it land in a different spot? Would it make a difference if you launch it from the north pole or from the equator? According to newton's equations, our projectile would land almost an hour after it was launched.

Is it a matter of the relative advantage of dexterous hands and the opportunity cost of developing more? Seven or nine fingers would seem to be more useful than 5 if a creature were being designed from the ground up.

For that matter, would it not be just as useful to have hands with two thumbs and a single central finger?

Since everything was going in an outward trajectory from the point of the Big Bang (if space is even considered to have existed then), and assuming there's no/negligible drag on a galaxy zooming through space, how would the velocities of Milky Way and Andromeda change to now be directed towards the point of collision? The only thing I can think of is if they're pulling on each other via gravity, but that seems unlikely given their distance of 2.537 million lightyears.

Can a galaxy's trajectory through space curve?

Are both the Milky Way and Andromeda headed in the same direction, and one is catching up to the other? But if that's the case, why would one of them be slowing down?

By without any harm I mean, no frost bite or hypothermia even after living in that temperature for hours. Shivering is fine. (Assume the person has access to infinite food, but the human is normal, so can eat only the amount his body allows him to eat and can digest.)

\___

This question is not about internal/core body temperature.


This question came to my mind while I was reading about how some researches found that living in cold temperatures lead to more number of brown fat cells.
And people with higher number of brown fat cells start to shiver at lower temperatures, because brown cells can use energy quicker to heat up the body.

I am trying find the lowest, the temperature which no one can withstand without body getting harmed.

Text: If there was an unmanned spacecraft that's emmiting a constant signal like a TV or radio broadcast, and this craft is traveling away from us at high speeds (for the sake of the question let's say 10% the speed of light), and there was a scientist at mission control always observing the signal. 

Assuming the signal is strong enough that connection wouldn't be lost, what kind of distortions would we see on earth? Would it appear to slow down as the craft got further away?

Text: I mean, because friction in space is very close to zero, nothing stands still in position or rotation, so, as a layman, I conclude the universe may be rotating itself, even if it is not of closed geometry. I know the last measurements point to a flat universe but this may also be that the universe is so gigantic we see it flat (like the flat earth illusion, isn't it?). Is there any way, or any research going on to check something as a rotation or torsion of distant regions?

Text: On April 8, 2024, the moon will pass between the sun and the Earth, creating a total solar eclipse. The path of totality will stretch from Mexico to Maine.

It's the last total solar eclipse visible from the contiguous United States until Aug. 23, 2044. On average, any given location experiences a total solar eclipse once every 375 years.

Joel Achenbach is a science writer on the Post's National Desk. He joined the Post's Style section in 1990 after eight years at The Miami Herald. He wrote the syndicated column Why Things Are, an online-only column Rough Draft for [washingtonpost.com](http://washingtonpost.com/) and later, while working for the Sunday magazine, created the newsroom's first blog,

Matthew Cappucci is a meteorologist for The Washington Post's Capital Weather Gang, as well as for the MyRadar app and various TV outlets. He is an avid storm chaser and self-proclaimed &quot;umbraphile,&quot; and has traveled thousands of miles chasing solar eclipses. Cappucci graduated in 2019 with a B.A. in atmospheric sciences at Harvard. Nowadays, he can be found roaming the Great Plains in an armored truck dodging hailstones the size of softballs while chasing after tornadoes. His second book, &quot;Extreme Weather for Kids,&quot; just came out.

Text: Hi reddit! We are leading the federal agency charged with setting and supporting the national agenda for mental health research and are excited to talk with you today.

[Joshua A. Gordon, M.D., Ph.D.](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director) is the Director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). He oversees an extensive research portfolio of basic and clinical research that seeks to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure. Dr. Gordon pursued a combined M.D.-Ph.D. degree at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Medical school coursework in psychiatry and neuroscience convinced him that the greatest need, and greatest promise, for biomedical science was in these areas. Dr. Gordon's research focuses on the analysis of neural activity in mice carrying mutations of relevance to psychiatric disease. His lab studied genetic models of these diseases from an integrative neuroscience perspective, focused on understanding how a given disease mutation leads to a behavioral phenotype across multiple levels of analysis. To this end, he employs a range of systems neuroscience techniques, including in vivo imaging, anesthetized and awake behavioral recordings, and optogenetics, which is the use of light to control neural activity. His research has direct relevance to schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, and depression. [Follow Dr. Gordon on Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/NIMHDirector).



[Shelli Avenevoli, Ph.D.](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/organization/od/about-nimh-deputy-director-shelli-avenevoli-phd), is the Deputy Director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). In 2001, Dr. Avenevoli joined the NIMH intramural research program as a staff scientist in the Section of Developmental Genetic Epidemiology of the Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program. In 2005, she moved to the NIMH division of extramural research as Chief of the Emotion, Mood, and Depressive Disorders Program. In 2008, Dr. Avenevoli became Chief of the Developmental Trajectories of Mental Disorders Branch. She has been heavily involved in a number of key NIMH efforts, including revising NIMH's Strategic Plan, re-defining the Institute's approach to supporting research in neurodevelopment and bipolar disorder, and serving as a liaison to other agencies for special initiatives. Prior to joining NIMH, Dr. Avenevoli received her Ph.D. in Developmental Psychology from Temple University, and completed an NIMH-funded postdoctoral fellowship in psychiatric epidemiology at Yale University School of Medicine.

Text: I am trying to learn about the near-field and far-field effects of antennas, but do not have the necessary background to understand. My knowledge of electromagnetic physics begins and ends by approximating what comes out of an antenna as a plane-wave over a sufficient distance.

However, when reading about the near-field, many descriptions of it refer to the em waves *reacting* with the antenna. This makes me wonder: hypothetically, if a massless, chargeless point in space began emitting electromagnetic waves, would there exist a near-field about this point in space, or would there be no near-field due to there being nothing for the waves to interact with?

Do other languages have equivalents to those two words?

Is there a term for those types of words?

Text: I've spent a lot of time recreating in the mountains in the northeastern US. I understand that the mountains there were shaped by the Laurentide Ice Sheet 10k+ years ago. This massive glacier reached all the way down to Long Island in NY State, which I understand is actually a glacial moraine. Today, the nearest glaciers to the region aren't anywhere close (Baffin Island maybe?). 

Conversely, I've also spent time in the Washington Cascades, which are still riddled with glaciers; some sizeable, but most are small in the grand scheme of things. I've been told that these glaciers used to be much larger in Washington, but even at the peak of the Ice Age, glaciers didn't even reach down to some of the valley floors in the eastern Cascades. 

So why is it that the Laurentide Ice Sheet formed and receeded so dramatically over thousands of miles in the northeast US, while the Pacific Northwest merely saw a growing and shrinking of our modern day glaciers? I know glaciers form when annual temperature and snowfall combined to prevent snow from fully melting during the summer. By that logic, the weather patterns over the Ice Sheet must have been wildly different than they are today, even a greater difference than the weather was and is in the PNW today.

Text: So I am rereading Project Hail Mary at the moment. 

In the book, the main character meets an alien, named Rocky, who lives on a planet with such a thick atmosphere that light can't reach the ground. The characters talk with each other about their biology at length in order to learn about one another, and they talk a lot about sleep, too. Rocky has a weird sleep cycle and lives on a planet that also spins very fast. His sleep cycle does not seem to match his planet's day-night cycle. 

This got me wondering about Earth life. From what I understand, all animals sleep, it's almost a biological mandate. Even though some are nocturnal, it seems that sleep cycles are still, somewhat, in tune with the rotation of the Earth. Sunlight would be the main indicator for the body for any creature that can see daylight. 

But what about animals that live in total darkness, like in caves or deep in the ocean? Do we know anything about their sleep patterns? If we do, do they somehow follow a day/night cycle?

I suspect we probably know very little about these animals, but I'm really curious about this.

If you then wait 6 months, if the Earth rotates every 24 hours, then youd expect to be facing the same direction, but this time youd be facing directly away from the sun. Why is it that throughout the year, we dont have to take into account the orbit around the sun when calculating time?

Text: Okay I've asked this question other places before, but I've never seemed to be able to get a proper answer from first principles.

Why is there desert at places along the latitude of Mexico, Sahara, and Arabia yet India and Bangladesh are some of the wettest rainforests?

My understanding is that at approx. 30 degrees north and south of the equator, the convection of heat creates zones of low moisture. Whereas the American and Gobi deserts are caused by their distance to the sea and the presence of mountains that block moisture.

So what explains the climates of Thailand, India, and Bangladesh? They are the same latitude as the other deserts and have a similar distance to the sea as Arabia and Mexico.

Another way to ask my question: If I were to imagine a new world map with a new set of continents, what principles could I use to determine which places would be deserts or rainforests?

Text: To quote Surf City, if there were “two girls for every boy” wouldn’t there be a big reproductive advantage for the population? Pregnancy takes a long time, but there’s no time constant on men. More pregnancies = more people = a stronger species. Humans have evolved to possess many biological advantages, but the 50/50 ratio of men and women seems like a missed opportunity.

Text: I’ve recently gotten into charcuterie, and in the textbook I use as my main resource, there is a chapter on whether or not we made better sausages in the past, citing things like: lack of excess preservatives beyond just curing salt or regular salt, hand making the sausages, and having to rely on nature as opposed to manufactured environments to cure and dry sausages. This also made me curious on a wider scale though: did we actually make better food (in regard to animal products like meat and dairy) in the past? When looking it up I came across an answer to a similar question someone asked on Quora (which I’m taking with a grain of salt) that said that due to things like feedlot farming and things like feeding cows corn due to the low cost and efficiency, even though it’s not their regular diet, can cause an animal to be stressed. In turn, apparently the adrenaline and cortisol can affect the taste of the meat. I know that things like diet and exercise for an animal can affect the taste of its meat, but can stress-related chemicals really do the same? And how does this hold true for something like foie gras, where birds certainly must be under stress as they are force fed in order to engorge the liver, yet most people enjoy foie gras for its taste, as well as its texture?

Text: In high school, I used to assume that the bone marrow was connected to the bloodstream in a simple way, and that all blood cells moved into the rest of the body by means of diffusion. But that is not the case. 

Apparently, finished blood cells have to &quot;squeeze&quot; through semi-permeable tissue before they're allowed to enter the veins. I doubt this is accomplished through simple stochastic processes alone. Unfortunately, it's been difficult trying to figure out how this looks at a granular level, and I don't know where to begin. 

I wanted to know more about how this is accomplished, if there are any key gateway proteins or other molecules responsible for the process, if this process looks substantially different for each kind of blood cell (e.g. RBCs, WBCs, platelets, etc.), etc. A brief rundown or series of pointers that can get me going on my own research would help enormously. Thank you!

Text: Earlier today, I was looking up what caused the glaciation of Antarctica, and also when it took place. As I understand it, the main causes were the appearance of the Circumpolar Current and a drop in global temperatures caused by falling CO₂ levels.

What I couldn't seem to find was an explanation as to ***why*** there was a global drop in CO₂ during the Late Eocene. The Azolla event is theorised to have been responsible for a similar drawdown during the Middle Eocene, but is separated from the Late Eocene by the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum, a period when CO₂ levels were among their highest.

To go from the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum to global temperatures being cool enough to allow permanent ice sheets to form over Antarctica, the drop in CO₂ levels in the Late Eocene must surely have been dramatic, but I couldn't seem to find an explanation as to what had caused/contributed to it.

Text: Self-explanatory. At that temperature we are well below CO2's freezing temperature, would it precipitate out of the atmosphere as CO2 snow? Or would the sunlight immediate ablate it back to a gaseous form. What about the gradient between neighboring air masses. If the -89 degrees area is surrounded by -70 degrees further away, would the CO2 flow into the colder area due to the difference in concentration? Could we harness this principle to precipitate CO2 out of the atmosphere by permanently creating extremely cold localized spots, precipitating then collecting and storing that CO2?

On that shadow is where we can see the solar eclipse happening. Therefore, if you were capable of being in any position of space at any moment (without inmediately asphyxiating, freezing and dying like, idk, Superman), and in a normal day of the week you positioned yourself a set distance from the Moon with the Sun behind it, right where the shadow the Sun casts is, could you not see a solar eclipse?

Text: Random thought I had after I read a thread about how quickly they reproduce while you are becoming ill and then your body either suppresses it and doesn't get passed on or you transfer it and it still gets suppressed in your body. 

So let's say I had the common cold or whatever you think is the best scenario, and I get sick but as I'm getting better I infect a person in the store and I get better. They then pass it on and on and so forth. 

What is the possibility that you catch the same virus that you originally had, be it weeks, months later? 

Could a virus just have started with one person and just kept spreading throughout history until now? Multiplying through the years? 

Sorry for the post in advance, just random pre-sleeping thoughts.

Text: As I am about to donate stem cells for a person with a disease of the hematopoietic system, I am currently very interested in the topic and would like to understand more, but I am not completely familiar with the subject.
When selecting a donor, attention is paid to various HLA characteristics in order to have a 10/10 match in the best case scenario. 

Is it a coincidence that unrelated donors and recipients have the same HLA characteristics?

And the second question is probably clarified by the answer to the first question and the fact that even siblings only have a 25% chance of being suitable donors: is there a possibility of a distant relationship if some (or all?) HLA characteristics match?

Perhaps someone has an explanation for me, in detail if possible, or any websites, papers or anything else that explains this in more detail.

I'm trying to search it up and I'm not getting any answers. For cross-presentation to occur to activate CD8 T cells, do these antigen-presenting cells engulf the whole epithelial cells to get access to the peptide? The question implied that the viruses wouldn't just be floating around extracellularly. I know the infected cells will have the MHC 1 for the cytotoxic T cell to kill them, but how are the T cells activated?

To me it just seems like the virus would be floating around extracellularly, but the questions was really making it seem like it wasn't. Is there anything that the dendritic cell can do with the viral genome?

Short version, I'm working on a story in a midevil-esque time period and metals are rare and precious in my world.  So with that in mind, I don't want staple weapons that anyone is able to get ahold of to be metal because most metal only the higher class can afford.  From watching too much TV and movies, I know that ceramic blades exist, mostly in the context of people using them to get a weapon past metal detectors.  But ceramics is a large industry in my world, so I decided to look into it, which led me down a rabbit hole of Zirconium Ceramic products, which is all well and good but I'm trying to find out what it *is* and all I'm getting is technical industry jargon that I can't understand.

From what I understand, ceramic=clay.  But Zirconium is metal.  So metal=/=ceramic.  But there is Zirconium Ceramic???

I just need a simple, clear cut, straight forward answer.  Is this Zirconium mixed *into* clay??  Like a powdered form of it is broken down and mixed into clay which is then processed and molded into products?  That's the only explanation I can think of.

Text: Im from the Philippines (which unluckily is on the Ring of Fire) and there has been an increase in earthquakes here. 2 days ago, a magnitude 7 was recorded and today a magnitude 5. 

What does this mean for us? Is this a sign that our volcanos will erupt? We have been anticipating a huge earthquake that we call “The big one”- is this bound to happen sooner? 

I know this sounds like a question an elementary student would ask but Id really like to hear the science side of this. Ty!

Text: Hi all,

I've recently seen the likely collapse of AMOC get more and more attention. Some more recent [papers ](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk1189)I've seen on the subject predict a brutal 10 ˙C drop in parts of Europe. Sadly I don't know enought about the subjects to tell this from these papers, but I was wondering: do these predictions include the predicted heating effect of climate change? So... is this a net drop, or something that is going to factor into a gradually warming climate?

While we're at that, all these things going on in the climate system: underwater methane traps, thawing permafrost, AMOC collapse, ice sheet loss, rainforest loss, and all of these affect the climate system... when you read about temperarure anomaly predictions, do those models account for their interplay? 

  
Thanks for your time!

Text: After three years and 72 flights over the surface of Mars, [NASA's Ingenuity helicopter](https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/) has touched down for the last time. Imagery downlinked from the helicopter indicated that one or more of its rotor blades [sustained damage during its Flight 72 landing on Jan. 18, 2024](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/9540/after-three-years-on-mars-nasas-ingenuity-helicopter-mission-ends/), rendering it no longer capable of flight.

Designed as a technology demonstration that was expected to fly no more than five times over 30 days, the helicopter's primary mission was to prove that powered, controlled flight on another planet was possible, which it did on April 19, 2021. But Ingenuity exceeded expectations, [transitioning into an operations demonstration](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-ingenuity-helicopter-to-begin-new-demonstration-phase) that paved the way for future aerial exploration on the Red Planet and beyond.

So, have you ever wanted to know what it's like to fly a helicopter on another planet? Or what it's like to [talk to the helicopter](https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/385/keeping-our-sense-of-direction-dealing-with-a-dead-sensor/) from here on Earth?

Text: Hello everyone,

I'm curious about how to handle number sequences that don't follow traditional linear patterns. For example, we all know a sequence like 2, 4, 6 can be easily described with a function like f(x) = 2*x. But what if we encounter a sequence that doesn't follow such a straightforward pattern? For instance, consider a sequence like 8, 3, 7, 1, -5, or any other seemingly random set of numbers.

My questions are:

1. How can we accurately describe these unconventional sequences using a mathematical formula?
2. Is there a method to predict future values in such sequences, assuming they follow some underlying but non-obvious pattern?

I'm interested in any mathematical or statistical models that could be applied to this problem. Any insights or references to relevant theories and techniques would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you in advance!

Text: In SMH of a mass on a spring, period is constant, as long as the mass and spring constant aren't changed.  The mass will return to equilibrium in a consistent amount of time regardless of the initial displacement.  However, when sound waves travel through air, the period of time it takes air molecules to return to equilibrium will depend on the frequency of the wave.  The same is true for transverse waves.  I had imagined the particles that perpetuate mechanical waves as acting like little masses on springs, but that's obviously not the whole picture.  What am I missing?

Text: Ok so the reason I'm asking this is more or less because like several years back an extended family friend claimed that global warming was caused not by human interference, but &quot;the sun is slowly heating up&quot;. At the time I was too stunned by the sheer gall of such a statement, and now it has dug its way up from the depths of my mind to resurface, like a barnacle on my brain. I don't know if maybe he misspoke or not, nor do I think I could have changed their mind back then (he was going down the conspiracy pipeline like it was the world's greatest slip'n'slide), but just in the one in a millionth chance I ever hear that argument again:

&quot;How much worse would it be if the sun was truly 'heating up' and causing global warming?&quot;

Like I'm assuming it would be impossible first and foremost, but in the case that global warming was caused by a gradual increase of sunrays, how &quot;over&quot; would it be for humanity? Since he said it about 4 years ago, if the sun truly was 'heating up' at a regular pace, would we not all be dead by radiation or something by this point in time? What is even the implication of &quot;the sun getting hotter&quot; other than it's about to go red giant and kill us all?

Text: If most of the various prion diseases out there affect the same PrP protein, why are there different diseases?

For example in fatal familial insomnia the main initial symptom is the namesake insomnia, but CJD is usually memory problems and behavioral changes, and similar differences for other prion diseases. I understand that the end-state is usually fairly similar, with all of them causing issues in the central nervous system and eventually death, but I'm curious about why they present differently in the beginning.

Is it because of different parts of PrP misfolding causes different symptoms? Or do they affect different parts of the nervous system? Or is it something else entirely?

And do all prion diseases come from PrP or are there other proteins that misfold and become prions, just more rarely?

Text: The Alpha Centauri System is roughly twice as massive as our own so I would expect their sphere of influence to be larger than our Solar System's? The Solar System's hill sphere according to google is a little more than a light year but the Oort Cloud apparently is even further out than that. Would the collective Oort Cloud of the Alpha Centauri system be bigger and is there material moving to and from the Alpha Centauri system and the Solar System?

Text: These seem like opposite processes to me, so the fact that they both release (extremely high) amounts of energy makes no sense.

Text: [According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_water#/media/File:Water_salinity_diagram.png) sea water is 34.7 parts per thousand salt.

Between evaporation and precipitation it seems like this amount is kept largely in equilibrium but, during the last glacial maximum, a lot of this precipitation would have frozen to form glaciers. 

Since that precipitation didn't make it into the ocean it stands to reason that this would have increased the salinity of the oceans. And sure, if the amount of water held in the glaciers was a drop in the bucket compared to the water in the oceans then I guess it wouldn't have made much of a difference.

But, [according to USGS][3]: &quot;global sea level was about 125 meters below today’s sea level at the last glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago&quot;. 

This kinda makes me wonder: how saline were the oceans during the last glacial maximum?

Text: Another post reminded me that an asteroids going close the speed of light could destroy a planet. But I'm wondering if there are any phenomena that could make it go that fast? 

A explosion of a star is limited in how much it can accelerate an object. 


My guess is that the fastest we can observe an object going is falling into a black hole, but it would lose that speed when it escapes that orbit. (My knowledge of orbital mechanics is limited to what i know from Kerbal, so i might be wrong. )


Are there other ways to accelerate an asteroid or is there a natural upper speed limit to how fast we''ll ever see an asteroid go (barring aliens or being sucked into a black hole)?

Text: When I say 'energy sources' I'm thinking about, like, where we get power here on earth to do work.

I think about this sometimes: a waterwheel gets you energy directly from gravity, which is pulling the water down, which turns the wheel, etc.

Well how did the water get *up* there? Heat, basically, from the sun. And energy from the sun comes from fusion of hydrogen in its core - but that hydrogen is fusing because of gravity.

So, any energy source that traces back to the sun - solar energy, hydrocarbons, windmills - traces back to gravity.

Geothermal power on earth: ultimately traces back to the gravitational violence that brought the earth together. Nuclear power: heavy elements formed by the violent collapse of a star, thanks again to gravity.

Is this right? Like, all sources of energy available to us, they all ultimately derive from gravity? Is there any energy source we could tap into, even hypothetically, that would *not* derive in this way? Can you turn the reasoning upside down and say, in all these cases, if you look at it another way, it all comes down to electromagnetism eg? Am I thinking about this the wrong way, or am I on to something interesting?

*edit*

I'm not trying to suggest something profound like &quot;is gravity the only real force&quot;, i know better than that.. I guess I'm asking, of the energy we can extract, is it all traceable back to *work* done by gravity? So gravity has a special role, to us at least, when it comes to concentrating energy in accessible forms. The only counter-example would be artificial fusion power, right?

**edit 2**

No one is talking about **entropy**. Am I getting at the fact (it is a fact, right?) that gravity is always reducing entropy, and that by 'releasing energy' we are simply increasing the entropy again? And that the other forces don't really have this kind of effect, of reducing entropy at macro scales? (I'm just making stuff up now).
