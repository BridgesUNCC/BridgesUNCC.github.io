The data set also includes the final growth year (e.g. 1810). I could understand how the dating occurred if there was recorded dates when the trees were cut down, but a lot of the data came from dead trees with no record of their final growth year. 

What are some ways trees could be dated without knowing the final growth year?

Text: My basic understanding of orbital mechanics would suggest that this should be possible right? I assume there's nothing to get in your way to slow your orbit in the event horizon. In a normal orbit you gain speed as you approach periapsis, then that speed flings you back out to apoapsis. I don't see any reason this wouldn't apply in the event horizon of a black hole.

So why is salt used for oxacillin (and apparently methicillin) but not other antibiotics?

That is, the rate of light production from the “Star” in our frame of reference should be so low as to not give off that much light at all?

Text:  

So my son came up with a hypothetical experiment about a beam that cannot flex and is incredibly long. The beam is placed such that it connects to an axel with a small portion extending past the axel on the other side (think watch hand). Also imagine the whole thing is in space. Could a spacecraft placed at the end farthest away from the axel be propelled to light speed by rotating the short piece on the other side the axel a short distance?

 I think I know that a point moves faster the farther away from the axel because it must keep up with all points closer but has farther to move. Other than this I am lost. This came after talking about about levers and Archimedes quote about moving the world with a long enough lever. P.S. I told him I don't think it would reach light speed but I am unsure as to why except that if this were true it would be common knowledge by now.

Thank you for your response

So if you really like basketball, your first game may be a &quot;core memory&quot;. You also only have a very small handful of them (&lt;10).

Now I'm not expecting a Pixar movie to have 100% accurate neurology, but are there any general concepts that are analogous to &quot;core memories&quot; in Inside Out? Are core memories, in any real sense, an actual thing?

These same fishermen claim that the resulting slurry stays cold much LONGER than just a cooler of ice without the salt. They've done no experiments with timing it, they just make the claim.

I understand the salt melting the ice, and the resulting slurry being partially liquid and the liquid being as cold as the solid.  What I don't understand, or even BELIEVE, without some explanation is that he mass would stay cool LONGER in one form or another.  It's as if they're saying that by adding salt, they've removed even more energy (heat) from the mass.

Sounds wrong to me.  Am I missing something?

For example - in 1930 testosterone normal level in the population is 10 units . So when you have a blood test the normal range is 8-12. 

In 2020 the normal level is 4 units, so the normal range has been adjusted to 2-6

I hope I am making sense, and I really hope to get an answer. To me this makes no sense. For sure adjustments are made based on better science, but not because the population is becoming unhealthier?

But a quick Google search says that Mendel only published his works on inheritance in 1966, 7 years after Darwin's book was published, and DNA was only discovered in 1869. I find it very unlikely that he'd be able to use the term &quot;genetic&quot; in the same sense as us.

Text: Most articles I've read on the matter estimate that between 80-95% of individuals that achieve major weight loss regain most or all of the weight down the road, typically within a couple years. Many people, in fact, will become heavier than they were originally. 

It seems that more and more articles are released every week discussing the seemingly &quot;irreversible&quot; metabolic impact of being obese and remaining obese for an extended period of time. 

That got me wondering, if the duration of obesity likely impacts long-term (potentially life-long) metabolic function, could the inverse be true as well? 

Could there be a critical period of time that a formerly obese person must maintain their weight loss before their normal metabolic function recovers or will they always have &quot;obesity in remission?&quot;

Does anyone know of any long-term studies that address this question?

EDIT (17:30): It just occurred to me, many people that lose large amounts of fat tend to lose a significant amount of lean muscle mass as well. I wonder if this may explain some or most of the loss in metabolism observed in some studies or if that's just a gross oversimplification

Text: Sometimes on x-rays you see little random calcium specks in soft tissues.  I googled this and got some basic info, but I would like a more biochemistry answer.  

The basics I found are that it's mostly normal and harmless.  It can be from injury, cancer (rapidly dividing cells), ageing, or no real reason.  

So I'm wondering what the biochemical process is.  Is there a protein that carries calcium around the body?  What's it called?  What is the chemical trigger that causes it to dump calcium there?  Why would ageing cause it?  Why would cancer cause it?

Text: This is probably a very stupid question but Google does not seem to help at all and it's been bugging me for the last 2 hours. 

The title is a very shortened and simplified version of my question, so let me explain it in more detail.

For example, a (obviously homozygous) blonde man and a homozygous dark haired woman had a female child. The daughter would be (again obviously) heterozygous, hair color-wise, meaning she has one allele coding light hair from her father and another one coding dark hair from her mother. By the laws of (probably highly simplified) genetics, the daughter would have inhairited dark hair, as the dark hair allele is the dominant one in her genotype. However, as I understand, to make sure both famale and male organisms have roughly the same level of gene expression in both sexes, RANDOM one of the X chromosomes in female organisms gets inactivated. Now back to the whole cat fiasco. I was reading about tortoiseshell cats and everything made perfect sense to me. Since one of the cat's X chromosome located alleles codes for orange hair, and another variation of it codes for black, AND  one gets inactivated with basically a 50/50 chance, the cats fur presents as a black-orange mosaic depending on the pigment amount/pigment variation coded in a specific cell. Back to our heterozygous daughter. Why isn't her hair a blonde-black mosaic? If the chromosome inactivated was inharited from her mother, the strand should be blonde and vice versa.
Now, I do have some theories about why that doesn't happen. For once, this overly simplified model of hair color inharitance is basically high school level genetics, so I'm sure someone's true hair color is determined by a variation of many genes. 
Another explenation would be the hair color genes only being situated on the 23rd pair in cats. 
Unfortunately, this just raised more questions in me. It can't only be cats then, right? Does any other mammal have this fur variation or something analogical? It also can't possibly only affect hair color, surely there are other alleles on the sex chromosomes that would fit into this weird expression loophole. 
While answering, try not to be to rough. I'm only just out of high school and about to re-take my finals. I'm very passionate about biology and so interested in genetics, but sometimes I just don't completely understand. Hope I got the terminology right, my Polish high school offered an &quot;English speaking&quot; biology class but the teacher actually didn't speak any English and she would just resort to handing out some English homework she stole of the web, lol.

I credit these video games to a few of my strengths in certain subjects over my schooling experience in my country (Which I feel leaves much to be desired,to keep it short. discussing that would be out of topic here.),but I want to know what the actual research says on how effective these types of games really are for fostering education in kids. 

Are you really doing children a big favor by having them play these types of games? I recall them being used during my Computer classes as well. (only there though) Other schools might use them even more frequently.

It was explained how people expect that we simply receive input to our retinas and we make sense of it and then give meaning to it, or something along the lines.

However, it was stated that we receive input to our retinas and this input is used to check against an already formed expectation of what we are &quot;supposed&quot; to be seeing.

Text: So we hopefully know that people can carry some genetic mutation as a heterozygote and have minimal (or no) symptoms, but potential offspring who are homozygous will then show the associated disease with worse symptoms, this is common. But I wonder if there are examples of genetic diseases where the heterozygous condition is actually more severe than the homozygote? Say if a single mutant allele incorrectly activates some pathway relative to wild type, whereas in the homozygote this creates such a large change that the cell responds and the net effect is minimal? Or if two different protein variants interfere with each others’ function, whereas again this potentially does not occur in the wt or homozygote? This could be a loss of function or gain of function effect on the protein. I am not thinking about sex linked genes, only autosomal, or compound mutants where the other allele is affected by a second variant.

I hear and read time and time again how it is impossible to know the position and velocity of X particle in a system and how that makes the universe nondeterministic. But as far as I'm concerned that is not a natural law but a restriction caused by our own inability to observe those data points without influencing the system ourselves.  


If in the future there was a way to measure such systems without interfering with them, would that negate the uncertainty principle?   


Or is it instead a natural law that will remain true (If the math holds up) no matter how far science advances?

Text:  Hello, this thing is completely destroying my brain.

HCO3- in renal tubules is &quot;reabsorved&quot; into the circulatory system through a bunch of reactions involving the carbonic anhydrase.

Basically:

\- It combines with H+ forming CO2 + H2O, that can enter the tubular cells;

\- The reverse reaction happens inside these cells: forming HCO3- + H+. The HCO3- is reabsorved into the blood, and the H+ goes back to the renal tubules to restart the cycle with another HCO3-.

I dont get how this is supposed to eliminate H+. Isn't the H+ net equal to 0 ?

Also, how does this make the pH higher? If it reabsorbs the HCO3-, then the H+ used wont be eliminated and vice versa, so I don't see how any of these actions (one or another) could make the pH higher.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if it is confusing and thank you.

Text: I've seen a couple stories recently wondering if the atmospheric rivers hitting the West Coast will end the drought. While they might refill reservoirs, recharging the water tables will take more than a single season.

There are efforts to sequester CO2 underground. Fracking is successful, in part, because of the top secret toxic mixture they pump into the shale to fracture it and increasing oil/gas flow.

In a similar fashion, could aquifers be actively recharged, speeding up that process? If so, are there any feasibility studies underway to investigate this idea?

Do solid celestial objects affect its propagation velocity or &quot;direction&quot;?  If our LIGO system observes a disturbance in a gravitational wave that originated from a distant object on the opposite side of the planet, is there an adjustment that needs to be made to the measurements to compensate for a potential delay, either by the propagation of the wave through the earth, or by it having to &quot;go around&quot; the earth?

What are possible implications of this?  if this is true, can we detect when a dark celestial body has passed between us and a distant known-constant gravity source, due to the refraction or interruption of the gravitational wave

Text: Hey there - I was sent here from r/AskHistorians they said it will be better suited for this subreddit.

I remember first hearing about this theory in the a late 90s/early 00s on Discovery channel.

For those who might not have heard of this: it's the hypothesis that when the Black Sea was reconnected to the Aegean Sea in the Early Neolithic age (around the 7th millennium BCE), the difference in water levels caused a cataclysmic deluge from the Aegean filling in the Black sea. This event would have devastated communities living by the coast. We know that there were lots of Neolithic settlements in Anatolia at the time, it makes sense for settlements to exist on the Black Sea coast as well which would have been wiped out.

As someone who was born by the Black Sea, this idea is fascinating !

I have not heard anything new about this theory (no development since the early 00s). So my questions are:

1. Has there been any subsequent studies done on this ? Or evidence discovered ?
2. If not then has this theory been disproven ? (gradual filling of the Black Sea instead?)
3. Is this theory considered a crackpot theory on the same level as Graham Hancock clickbait ?

Thank you for your time

My concern is with the brain. Her body seems okay, but how likely is it she could face mental issues? 

And if certain mental disorders already run in the family (adhd, addiction, bipolar, learning disabilities) how likely is it that drug use during development has increased the likelihood? Or could drugs have increased the possible severity?

Also, could there be abnormalities in the body that weren’t detected? Like could an organ have developed wrong and we won’t know until she’s older?

Text: Was in a discussion about radiometric dating, and someone suggested this paper: http://library.sciencemadness.org/lanl1_a/lib-www/pubs/00285784.pdf

They claimed the paper shows how radiometric dating is unreliable, because radioisotopes can be leeched or absorbed which would through off the ratio of daughter to parent isotope.

In practice, I’m sure scientists wouldn’t excavate samples anywhere near known nuclear tests sites or radioactive waste. I also know we have isochron methods to help identify contamination, but does anyone know how this is actually practiced? 

How do we account for this type of contamination or does the paper have any real implications on radiometric dating?

Thank you

Text: Hi! My name is Tareq Abu Hamed. I am originally from East Jerusalem, and I hold a PhD in chemical engineering from Ankara University. I did my first post doctorate research at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, where I worked at the Environmental Sciences and Energy Research Department. My second post doctorate was at the University of Minnesota, at the Solar Energy Laboratory of the Mechanical Engineering Department. I have published in a wide variety of journals and have received several awards for my research, including the Dan David Prize. Previously, I served as the Deputy Chief Scientist and the Director of Engineering Research at The Ministry of Science, Technology and Space. I also established the Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation at the Arava Institute. I am currently the Executive Director of the Arava Institute and a researcher at the Dead Sea and Arava Science Center.

You can read about my role as Deputy Chief Scientist here: https://www.haaretz.com/science-and-health/2015-03-22/ty-article/east-jlem-palestinian-tapped-deputy-chief-scientist/0000017f-e34c-d568-ad7f-f36f0f2a0000

The Middle East is a global hot spot for climate change and environmental stress on water, energy, agriculture, health and other necessities. Many cities in our region are predicted to become uninhabitable by the end of the century. In recognition of this pressing reality, the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies is conducting a variety of academic and research projects that combines regional environmental diplomatic activity, academic research, and the initiation and execution of projects throughout the Middle East.

One of our great projects is Methuselah. Methuselah is a date palm that Dr. Elaine Solowey sprouted from a 2,000-year-old date seed. This seed, among others, was found during the excavations of Masada in the mid 1960's. In 2005, several of these seeds were obtained by the Louis L. Borick Natural Medicine Research Center of the Hadassah Medical Organization, which gave them to Dr. Elaine Solowey at the Center for Sustainable Agriculture. Dr. Solowey successfully germinated one of these seeds, which sprouted into a young date palm.

Initially thought to be botanically impossible, this successful project has been featured in the New York Times, National Geographic, and other publications. Today, Methuselah has a permanent home in the Arava Institute research park on Kibbutz Ketura.

I saw some picture of a doctor and nurses sitting on the floor in exhaustion after a 36 hour life-saving surgery (or so the post claimed). 

.

I then found myself wondering - how do the shifts work in such a procedure? Surely it wasn't the same staff for 36 hours, right? Is there an overlap where a second team takes over and is fully briefed over an hour or more, or what?
If the scope of the operation is uncertain, how are the shifts designed?

.

In my mind this is a scientific question about procedures in the field of medical science. I hope you agree and that someone can offer some valuable insight.

Millions and millions of gallons are used DAILY, which surely can’t be sustainable long-term. Especially so with the population now reaching 8 billion and climbing. Is there actually a plan in place or is the “doomsday” so far out that it’s actually not a cause of concern for those in power?

I got here thinking about what the night sky would look like for a species that developed, completely implausibly but not technically impossibly, early in the lifetime of our universe. I don't even know when that'd be, but just for example, would someone looking up on an Earth-like planet in a random galaxy 4, 5, 6 billion years ago see more things because fewer things were seriously redshifted? If not, is it a matter of those numbers are too small or it would never amount to a noticeable difference? Would local (intragalactic) contributions be a much bigger variable anyway?

Text: I know this seems like a broad question, but I didn’t know how to summarize my question adequately for the title. I’ve been trying to understand different evidences of common ancestry, and one topic that had been brought up was the discovery of endogenous retroviruses and their presence in the human genome and other animals, which points to a common ancestor.

To clarify, my question is how do we know the retroviruses found in our DNA and the DNA of other species are from a virus infecting a common ancestor, and not a result of a prevalent virus in the past that infected multiple species around the same time, resulting in an alteration of the genomes of different species but occurring around the same time? If that makes sense.

I don’t necessarily believe that, but growing up in a very conservative, 6-day creationist, Christian household, I think that it’s a thought that could pop up in response to the ERV findings, so I am interested in what the rebuttal would be. I am not knowledgeable at all in these areas, and so I’m grateful to anyone who can help me understand and learn this in a simpler way, if possible. Thanks!

Text: Some context: 

Where I live in NH, the average historical daily temp continues to drop after the Winter Solstice (December 21 this year) and doesn't level off and start getting warmer until about mid-January. Why is that?   


Additionally, the average temperature climbs slower from Winter into Spring than it drops from Fall into Winter. What's going on there?   


Based on my naïve understanding, I'd expect the temperature to be relatively symmetrical around the Solstice (Solstice - 1 roughly = to Solstice + 1, etc), but that's clearly not the case. 

Can someone help explain this to a weather newbie?

Text: I know about aluminium hydroxide and how it's used to increase the immune response when putting in vaccines. The virus protein interacts with the immune system , leading to an acquired immunity. Aluminium hydroxide increases this effect. 

But here's the thing. In the case that there's already a virus or pathogen there, and there's already an immune response in the body (albeit a weak one), can aluminium adjuvants alone serve to boost immune response and increase chances of recovery? Or is it's effectiveness dependent on an already weakened antigen?

Text: We   all know the benefits of masks in reducing the number of respiratory   infections, and that fact was reinforced during the pandemic. Many of us   are still wearing masks in our daily lives and have successfully   avoided not only corona infections but other respiratory infections as   well.

On the other hand, not   getting infected with respiratory viruses also means that our immunity   wanes over time. We know that roughly half of the population of people   who live in isolated tribes die when they contract a respiratory virus   after contact with a modern human, because they lack immunity.

Could masks contribute to a waned immunity and therefore have a negative effect on population health in the long term?

It dives into numerous utopian and radical subcultures, from cryptoanarchists, cypherpunks, and gold-standard libertarians to Extropians and transhumanists, all of whom - as it turned out - were tied into the project of trying to invent computational money. 

I was recently featured as one of the experts in NOVA's documentary film, &quot;Crypto Decoded&quot;, about the history behind cryptography and cryptocurrency. You can watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnavKPl5f9I

 Ask me anything about:

+ Will crypto change how we think about money?
+ Where else is cryptography used?
+ How did cryptocurrency begin?
+ Are cryptocurrencies hacker-proof?
+ What problems has cryptography solved?

Text: The holiday season can be painful enough without suffering from physical agony, so we're here to answer questions you may have about pain and pain relief.

More than 20% of Americans endure chronic pain - pain that lingers for three months or more. While pharmaceuticals can be helpful, particularly for short-term pain, they often fail to help chronic pain - sometimes even making it worse. And many people who struggle with opioid addiction started down that path because to address physical discomfort.

Join us today at 3 PM ET (20 UT) for a discussion about pain and pain relief, organized by USA TODAY, which recently ran a 5-part series on the subject. We'll answer your questions about what pain is good for, why pain often sticks around and what you can do to cope with it. Ask us anything!

**NOTE: WE WILL NOT BE PROVIDING MEDICAL ADVICE**. Also, the doctors here are speaking about their own opinions, not on behalf of their institutions.

Text: I'd like to start by explaining how I see evolution takes place.

So, small mutations are occurring with every new generation. The new offspring will have new genetics and will progress the evolution.

But in order for these new mutations to spread, that individual needs to have new offspring. Hope I got it so far, please correct me if I'm wrong.

Now, we come to the difference between apes and humans, in terms of chromosome count. We know that at some point 2nd chromosomes fused and we got 1 less pair.

So, my question is, how did this mutation propagate, if species with different chromosome count cant interbreed? Let's say an offspring is born with this new mutation, and he has his/her chromosome fused. First of all, he will most likely look/behave differently than the rest of the tribe, reducing his chance of survival. Second, he would require a peer with the same mutation to interbreed with and spread this mutation. I can see this process unfolding in species that have hundreds of offspring (like laying a bunch of eggs with a lot of them having the same mutation), but can't imagine that in an environment that produces a handful of offspring every now and then.

Text: Last night my family and I were debating how the light moves from the electricity (or plasma, whichever makes the electromagnetic radiation) to our eyes whenever lightning strikes.

I proposed that if the light didn't scatter through the droplets and atmosphere, then all we would see is the strike itself and the sky would remain dark. So I was imagining that refraction between water and air as well as internal reflection of the droplets is what causes the light to reach our eyes, not that the sky lights up like a light bulb does.

I also argued that different points on Earth would receive varying levels of light from each strike because of the random nature of water droplets and the structure they happen to form at that moment. So whether a particular strike is bright depends on where you are, not just the amount of energy released. (because different places would receive different numbers of rays, so the sky looks a different brightness. Kinda like how the moon always reflects along a body of water in the direction of the observer, each point gets varying directions of electromagnetic waves)
. This is kinda what I want fact-checked the most.



P.s. I couldn't find anything useful online, just generic &quot;oh, lightning occurs when clouds polarise&quot; and nothing about the path of the light.

Text: Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Biology, Chemistry, Neuroscience, Medicine, Psychology**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for 'X' were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;.

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field.

So are nutrients just swept along in the plasma? I have no idea how they go from the intestines to the cells that need them.

I've been trying to research this, but I haven't had much luck. I'd appreciate any help you can offer. Thanks in advance!

I suppose the ball is not completely necessary as I could be asking about the gravitational potential energy of some of the water itself. Since the water expands as it freezes into ice, and its shape is bounded by its container, presumably some of it ends up higher up as ice than it was as liquid.

One option is to arrange for the melt water to drain away, thus reducing the mass that needs to be heater. However, the water that drains away will cary some heat out of my system. Which effect will dominate? Does it depend on the geometry of the ice block, or perhaps the method of heating?

Text: (Unsure if best place to ask/best flair, thank you for your time.)

I obtained a scald injury on my hand recently, and have been researching radiation casually. I experience flares of pain on the scald area whenever I accidentally warm the skin up, such as proximity to warm skin or hot mugs, etc. Naturally, on the flip side, cold = good.

It got me wondering: could a radiation burn feel similarly? I know about sun exposure increasing pain for some radiation burns, but I don't know about warmth-related pain, since it's UV that causes the sunlight pain.

I couldn't find an answer by Googling, and my guess is no they don't (except from burns from thermal radiation) but I have no reason to think that, I guess. A burn is a burn, right? Or are radiation burns fundamentally different in some way?

I understand that they work to reduce appetite and slow the digestion of food. But how is it that they do this? And why are these drugs seemingly so much more effective than other appetite suppressants that we've developed in the past? Everything just mentions that they slow the digestion of food and that leads to weight loss, but this feels like an incomplete explanation. Presumably other drugs have been able to suppress appetite, so ultimately my question is if some other mechanism is at play.

Text: Ever since &quot;The Last of Us&quot; premiered on HBO earlier this year, we've been bombarded with questions about Cordyceps fungi from our family members, friends, strangers, and even on job interviews! So we figured it would be helpful to do this AMA, organized by the American Society for Microbiology, to dive into the biology of these microbes and explain how they wreck their special breed of havoc. Each of us studies a different host/parasite system, so we are excited to share our unique (but still overlapping) perspectives. We'll take your questions, provide information on the current state of research in this field, and yes, we'll even discuss how realistic the scenario presented on the show is. We'll be live starting at 2 PM ET (19 UT). Ask us anything!

Text: I always wanted to ask this, 'cos it puzzles me.

1. You have a high pressure helium tank, closed, but connected to a large empty balloon, underwater. You open the tank and fill the balloon with a significant volume (should work if enough pressure in the tank). Will the system start floating?
2. You have a closed tight syringe-like tube with a piston inside, in &quot;compressed&quot; state (occupying low volume), underwater. Inside the tube, there is a small electric engine (powered by a battery) connected to the piston. The weight of the whole system is very low. Starting the engine (i.e. remote controlled) will push the piston towards outside (increasing the volume). Will the tube start floating if enough delta-volume is made by the movement of the piston?

Text: Hi all,

MRI scans tend to take around 20 minutes of operation to get the data versus an x-ray (5 seconds) or CT (10 minutes or so). I understand (to a small extent) that the MRI creates a magnetic field that aligns the proton and then when the magnet is then switched off it detects the movements of these protons back to their original state to draw the picture. Why though does this take 20mins? Is it doing this multiple times or just one long charge/release?

Text: Of course perceived color is subjective, and in practice the same object can appear very different under different light conditions, angles, etc.  I'm wondering if there's *any* standard system to assess &quot;the&quot; color for an object, perhaps by observing its reflection in an ISO-standard light box.  If so, is there a standard way to convert that into human-visible color in RGB terms, given an ISO-standard monitor?  Is there an industry standard calculation between the output of a visual-wavelength telescope and an image on nasa.gov?

If it helps: I was reading about [gilding metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilding_metal) and wondered if there was a visual difference between, say 6:1 Cu/Zn brass and 12:1 Cu/Zn brass, assuming two samples were measured in the same facility after processing them to equal polish, etc.

and next ...  can you squeeze 2 neutrons together to form a black hole?  
but next.... can you squeeze 1 neutron together (the quarks in it) to become a black hole?  
and even next.....  if the previous is true, than in fact a quark is a black hole on itself...  Or a quark is composed of even smaller particles that can be squeezed together to form yet another even smaller black hole....  
But if that is true, these smaller particles are black holes on their own, and that is not possible...

Some sites say myeloid cells become all types of blood cells including red ones &amp; platelets, apart from lymphocytes which come from lymphoid cells. So, does that make monocytes and NK cells types of lymphocytes? When I look into that it just starts telling me that dendritic cells and macrophages are both actually monocytes, which confuses things further. Returning to the original point though, some sites directly state that monocytes come from myeloid cells, which is the complete opposite of the lecture material.

Text: So... I have two competing mental models of what EM radiation *actually* is from a mechanical perspective. (Turns out a &quot;mechanical perspective&quot; might not be possible which is... distressing.) 

1.  Photons are not EM radiation, but they have EM &quot;fields&quot; around them in the same way that, say, protons and neutrons have &quot;fields&quot; that interact with each other, and those &quot;fields&quot; are where the &quot;waves&quot; come in. These fields are not governed by particles, but are rather some vague *other thing*.  

OR:  

2. Photons *are* EM radiation, and they move in a straight line... but only when we're paying close attention, because wave-particle duality. They are the medium propegating the &quot;waves&quot;.  

I must be wrong either way. Because we can *measure* these waves in terms of length, specifically in nanometers.  

I'm inclined to think that I'm closer to reality with #1 considering that [&quot;reducing all forces to collision&quot; is apparently a lost cause](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance) which my brain is really having trouble accepting as anything but magical thinking.  

If #1 is closer to the correct way of viewing things, you're telling me that this particular spooky action at a distance occurs over great enough distances to be expressed in nanometers? And more importantly, how can we even measure that it occurs in &quot;waves&quot; spanning nanometers?  I know it's describing a &quot;vector field&quot; but doesn't that still require some *thing* that could be detected and measued as having a velocity, and therefore momentum and mass, i.e. a bunch of particles?

And what do photons even *do* in this context? I've seen them described as essentially a side-effect?

**Edit:** I love all the discussion occuring but it's also made me realize that the body of my post mostly goes beyond the question. The question being, we're able to describe the physical wavelength in nanometers of these waves that apparently aren't oscillating in space so much as they oscillate between electric and magnetic fields.  ...how do you assign a unit of length to that?

Or maybe this reaction requires some extreme conditions that we don't know about? I think it has a profound relevance to the RNA world hypothesis

Now both start training and doing exactly the same, same workout plan, same diet. Will the person who has been muscular before gain muscle mass more easily than the other one?
I'm asking this because I hear and read about this phenomenon and people calling it 'muscle memory'. I think muscle memory means something else but I am still wondering if this phenomenon exists.

Text: Hello all, I've been deeply interested in Planetary Sciences and the early evolution of the solar system. I'm also the lead on the initial Mineralogy/Petrology of the meteorites found by the Australian Desert Fireball Network (DFN), an interdisciplinary research group that is working to uncover the mysteries surrounding solar system formation. Digital observatories, part of the DFN, monitor a third of Australian skies, all night. The DFN images and studies the paths of fireballs in the sky, their trajectories, and orbits using intelligent imaging systems. As a geologist, I want to know where rocks come from, along with their composition and distribution. Trying to mesh those two is kind of the holy grail in figuring out what the solar system is really like. In 2006, an asteroid was named after me - Asteroid 6579 - for my contributions to planetary science.

In August 2022, my work was featured in [Interesting Engineering](https://interestingengineering.com/science/astrogeologist-space-rocks-important), and the publication helped organize this AMA session. Ask me anything about asteroids, meteorites, planetary science, and my work with the Desert Fireball Network.

I'll be on 5 PM (November 29th US ET / 22 UT / November 30th 6 AM in Perth (GMT+8)) to answer your questions, AMA!

Text: I read somewhere that the higher the IQ the more you are likely to be creative and the people with lower IQs do not show the same ability in creativity. Then another source, this one a more recent study, said that IQ and creativity is linked, but at a certain point (around 120 IQ), there stopped being a correlation. I'm curious about this since there are existed highly creative people with high IQs, then there was people who with average and even below average IQs that showed same levels of creativity.

Is there a correlation? Is there a breakpoint at some level and it depends more on other factors?

Text: Currently there are pictures floating around Reddit of how the earthquakes in Turkey resulted in a fault line visually having shifted several meters.

What would happen to a person standing right on the edge of this?

Most images show one side moved (like the traintracks one showing the tracks didn't shift on one side, yet having moved several meters on the other side).

So, extended:

* What would happen to a person standing on the moving side.
* What would happen to a person standing on the side that didn't move.

Considering even a whales call can cause physical damage to a person if they get to close, I'm suspecting the release of energy alone isn't particularly healthy, no matter which side you're standing.

Additionally, are there any  known cases of a person or telemetry device experiencing this?

Text: When most people think of tick-borne illnesses, the first thing that comes to mind is usually Lyme disease. Yet its closely-related cousin relapsing fever, while not as prevalent, has actually been foundational in the study of vector-borne diseases. Largely unknown today, the story of relapsing fever is a fascinating exploration of scientific research that contains important lessons for modern medicine.

Join us today at 2 PM ET (19 UT) for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), all about relapsing fever. We hope to shine a light on the mechanism and biology of relapsing fever, and to highlight how research on forgotten and ignored diseases can have real impact on health and medical advances.

With us today are:

Is there any reason that the target and accelerated element could not be the same element?

Example: To reach the theoretical island of stability at 126, could you not fire europium (63) at a europium target?

Example 2(known elements): using aluminum(13) to fuse iron(26)?

Is the barn number just too small, or is there another factor?

Text: I was reading this paper (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10717540801905124) and I was wondering about this part below and I had a few questions.

“Synthesis of Aminated Gelatin

Aminated gelatin was synthesized by the reaction of native cationic gelatin with 1, 2-ethylenediamine (Wang et al. 2000). Briefly, native cationic gelatin was dissolved in phosphate buffer (pH 5.3), and 1, 2-ethylenediamine, was added under stirring. After adjusting the pH to 5.0 with 5 M HCl, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride was added. The final concentrations of native gelatin, ethylenediamine, and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride in the resultant solution were 20, 56, and 10.7 mg/mL, respectively. The resultant solution was incubated at 37°C for 18 hr, followed by dialysis against purified water for 48 hr, and then freeze-dried to obtain the aminated gelatin. The numbers of primary amino groups introduced into the native cationic and aminated gelatin were measured by the TNBS method (Snyder and Sobocinski 1975). The amino group contents of the native cationic gelatin and aminated gelatin were 0.33 and 0.64 mmol/g, respectively.

Preparation of Gelatin Microspheres

NGMS and CGMS were prepared by glutaraldehyde cross-linking in the dispersed state of an aqueous gelatin solution in the oil phase by a modification of the method of Tabata and Ikada (1989). Briefly, 1 mL native cationic or aminated gelatin aqueous solution (10 wt%, preheated to 40°C) was added dropwise to 25 mL olive oil and then emulsified by vortex-mixing to yield a water-in-oil emulsion. The emulsion temperature was dropped to 4°C, then 7.5 mL cold acetone was added to the emulsion and stirring was continued for 1 hr to induce gel formation. The resulting microspheres were collected by centrifugation (2500× g, 4°C, 5 min) and washed three times with acetone. The cross-linking of the microspheres was carried out using 0.06% glutaraldehyde in acetone/0.01 M HCl solution (7:3) at 4°C for the indicated time. Following collection by centrifugation (2500× g, 4°C, 5 min), the microspheres were agitated in 10 mM aqueous glycine solution at room temperature for 1 hr to block the residual aldehyde groups of the unreacted glutaraldehyde. The resulting microspheres were finally washed three times with purified water by centrifugation and then freeze-dried.”

From Millipore Sigma’s website “Physical Properties: Type A gelatin has 78-80 millimoles of free carboxyl groups per 100 g of protein and a pI of 7.0-9.5.”

What does it mean when there’s a range for the isoelectric point? Does it mean that using the procedure from the paper, it can increase type A gelatin’ s isoelectric point to be closer to 9.5? From the second paragraph, are microspheres just powders? Would it be soluble in water? Lastly, is an isoelectric point the same as a pH point of zero charge? Thanks so much!

The spacecraft - which landed on Mars in 2018 - detected 1,319 [marsquakes](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-insight-records-monster-quake-on-mars), gathered data on the [Red Planet's crust, mantle, and core](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-insight-reveals-the-deep-interior-of-mars), and even captured the sounds of [meteoroid impacts](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-insight-hears-its-first-meteoroid-impacts-on-mars) miles away on the Martian surface.

So, have you ever wanted to know how operating a lander on Mars is different from a rover? Or how engineers practice mission operations in an [indoor Mars lab here on Earth](https://youtu.be/q9NptmKlXms)? How about what we might still learn from InSight's data in the months and years to come?

Meet six team experts from NASA and other mission partners who've seen it all with this mission, from efforts to get InSight's heat probe (or &quot;mole&quot;) into the Martian surface to the marsquakes deep within the planet.

We are:

+ Phil Bailey (PB) - Operations lead for the robotic arm and cameras. Also worked with InSight's Earthly twin, ForeSight, at NASA JPL's In-Situ Instrument Laboratory.
+ Kathya Zamora Garcia (KG) - Mission manager for InSight, also helped clean InSight's solar arrays with Martian dirt.
+ Troy Hudson (TH) - A former instrument systems engineer and anomaly response team lead for the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Probe, known as &quot;the mole.&quot;
+ Mark Panning (MP) - Project scientist for InSight, specializing in planetary seismology.
+ Emily Stough (ES) - Led surface operations for InSight.
+ Brett White (BW) - Power subsystem and energy management lead with Lockheed Martin, which helped build the lander.

Ask us anything about:

+ How InSight worked
+ Marsquakes
+ How the interiors of Mars, Earth and the Moon compare and differ
+ Meteoroid impacts
+ Martian weather
+ InSight's legacy

However other sources I’ve read talk about orthostatic hypotension as one of the common symptoms of POTS, so I’m confused by this contradiction.

For example:

“Significant initial orthostatic hypotension (IOH) occurs in \~50% of postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) patients and 13% of controls. Heart rate and blood pressure recovery are prolonged in IOH sustaining lightheadedness; IOH is more prevalent and severe in POTS.”  
[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32702262/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32702262/)

”Symptoms include fast heart rate coupled with low blood pressure”

[https://www.ehlers-danlos.org/what-is-eds/information-on-eds/postural-tachycardia-syndrome-pots/](https://www.ehlers-danlos.org/what-is-eds/information-on-eds/postural-tachycardia-syndrome-pots/)  


Can someone clarify for me why this diagnostic criteria seems to conflict across so many sources? 

Is it a lack of consensus in the medical community? A change in what is known about the condition rendering old criteria outdated? Or do different types/causes of POTS manifest differently? I did notice low bp/orthostatic hypotension most often seemed to be mentioned as a symptom in the context of POTS cases associated with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and MCAS (which is itself often associated with EDS).

Text: I am Shimon Rachmilevitch, a plant ecophysiologist at the Institute for Agriculture and Biotechnology within the Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research at Ben Gurion University of the Negev since 2007. I completed my B.Sc. in Biology, and then continued to complete my M.Sc. and Ph.D. in plant sciences, all degrees at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. I carried out post-doctoral research at University of California Davis and Rutgers University and spent three years as a visiting professor at Harvard and Cornell universities. I published over 100 peer reviewed studies and supervised over 50 students and post docs from all over the world, of which most have continued either in academic or industrial research.

The overall goal of my research is to explore adaptation and acclimation mechanisms of plants to the desert environment in both natural and agricultural vegetation. Understanding tolerance mechanisms of plants grown in desert environments is invaluable for increasing the genetic pool of tolerant plants for agriculture and for maintaining biodiversity in natural ecosystems. A focus of this research is the root system and the interaction between roots and shoots that enable plants to prosper in drylands. The lab takes advantage of its location in the desert and studies the surrounding natural and agricultural ecosystems. I collaborate with many researchers and receive research grants from different foundations, including the Israeli Science Foundation, BARD, and Ministry of Agriculture. In the last six years I managed the &quot;Root of the Matter&quot; knowledge center. I also collaborate with the agritech industry including Baier, Evogene, Netafim and Syngenta.
I serve as the head of the Israeli Society for Plant Sciences and the Mirilashvili Center for Food Security in the Desert, and am the chair of the DDD - Desert, Dryland and Desertification international conference in collaboration with the UN, which in its last conference, hosted over 800 scientists from more than 50 different countries.

You are welcome to learn more about my lab: https://rachmilevitchlab.weebly.com/

Text: I recently finished The Song of the Cell by Siddhartha Mukherjee, one chapter of which gives a potted history of the field of immunology.  One section pertained to how cells continuously present a random sampling of their internal protein &quot;inventory&quot; to the exterior, bound to an MHC I molecule.  If a passing killer (CD8+) T cell examines this MHC I/peptide complex and determines that the bound peptide is of viral origin, it will kill the infected cell.

Assuming that the presentation of peptides on the cell surface is nonspecific and random, and thus could presumably include normal &quot;native&quot; proteins, how does the killer T cell &quot;know&quot; that a given MHC I-bound antigen is of pathogenic origin, thus triggering the response to kill the infected cell?  Any failure in this discriminatory process could lead to a devastating autoimmune response, I would think, so the cell must be able to tell &quot;self&quot; proteins from &quot;non-self&quot; proteins.  But *how* is this feat accomplished?

So I checked historical data from my location and indeed, on clear summer days, the temperature can reach 35 degrees celsius during the day and drop to around 15 at night, that's a temperature change of 20 degrees. In winter, the biggest change I found for my location is 10 degrees. But overall, it seems to me that the changes are more dramatic in summer than in winter.

Is it overall cloud coverage? Is it absolute humidity? Is it the energy cost of water freezing and melting? Or is it just my location that is like this?

Text: I tried to Google this and did not get any answers specific to this question. From what I understand, you really only need one kidney to survive. That's why live donors/recipients are a thing. Also, if you were born with two healthy kidneys one can pick up the slack of the other if something goes wrong. So will they only know you have a kidney problem when BOTH fail? I assume as long as one is functioning, your tests and blood work would come back normal.

EDIT: To piggyback this logic, why don't we have more 'spares' of other organs. Why is the redundancy factor only built into kidneys?

Text: The question is a bit hectic but I wasn't sure how to word it properly.

Basically if we consider bacteria and viruses causing illness in humans, are they present for so long only because there was always someone to &quot;pass it on&quot;?

In other words, if we were lucky enough to get to a point where nobody would be infected by smallpox, would that mean the end of smallpox? I know there are of course things like the bacteria being able to survive without a host for some time on contaminated surfaces, etc., but hosts remain their main way of survival, right?

The thought that brought me to this question was whether the wide range of diseases we know today exists because we were never lucky enough for nobody to be infected by that specific bacteria for example.

Text: Hi,
I'm looking for an explanation of what's happening [in this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zedHH9_F94).

Is this from the piezoelectric effect creating tiny sparks when the metal hits, from the crystals in the metal or coating? The drill bits are coated in titanium nitride but the un-coated ends hitting have the same effect.

Text: I received a new, unglazed terracotta tagine (Moroccan clay cooking vessel) for Xmas, which came with directions for curing &amp; seasoning before its first use. I sort of understand the science behind seasoning cast iron, but not this.

1. Submerge tagine in water for 12 hours
2. Let dry in open air for 48 hours
3. Rub interior with olive oil
4. Put in cold oven, set at 350F and leave for 2-2.5 hrs

My questions:

1. What's the point of submerging in water if we're just going to let it dry? What's happening there?
2. When seasoning cast iron, I understand to use oil with higher smoke point and use a much higher temperature in oven, like 450-500 degrees F. Is there any logic behind using olive oil besides &quot;authenticity&quot;? Is the lower temp because of the olive oil, or the clay? Is the olive oil creating a polymer layer, like in cast iron?
3. Is there any reason why the manufacturer would ship this tagine uncured and unseasoned? Is there a benefit for the purchaser/user doing it themselves - like, maybe my tagine is more fragile now?

Text: Suppose that we had a laser that could release a single photon, and imagine that the photon has a particular &quot;ID number.&quot; 

We use this laser two times to send a photon from point A to point B.  We do this once in empty space and then once through a medium like sugar water, glass, or diamond.

It is my understanding that the light is slowed through the medium because photons are absorbed and then re-emitted repeatedly.  

First question: So my question is, in the case of the diamond, glass, or water does the ***same photon*** that entered at point A exit at point B?  E.g. Would our imaginary ID number be the same?    


I presume it would be for the photon traveling empty space.  


Second question: Are all photons at the same wavelength identical so that it just doesn't make any sense to ask this question or are there some properties that are effectively randomized each time it is re-emitted?

  
Probably a basic question, but I never see discussion of refraction or mediums slowing light down make this clear to me.

Text: I've found this claim repeated all across the Internet: that if unused for years or months (a site even says weeks!), the rubber gaskets and seals (some sources mention specifically in the motor) will &quot;dry up and crack&quot;, leading to leaks once it's used again.

I find this a bit difficult to believe. I know UV radiation can cause cracking in rubber and plastic, but dryness? That may be the case with some kinds of sponges, but afaik rubber gaskets or seals don't need to be moist to retain elasticity. Besides, the outer side of the gasket should be dry even when the machine is used. 

Is there a scientific basis for this that I'm missing, or it's a legend that people just hear and repeat?

I've found an interesting series of videos that talk about humongous structures in space like the dyson sphere. One of these structures is called the shkadov thruster which is capable of accelerating stars. The actual acceleration is very slow and would take billions of years to get any decent velocity out of it, but the concept is fascinating - taking billions of years, untold resources and a star to make the biggest bomb in history.

So I'm curious, what would it actually do if it hit something? I'm fairly certain everything in the size of the solar system would be basically gone. So would this annihilate some significant portion of the galaxy?

I understand that the CMB consists of low energy photons because the radiation gets stretched as space expands. Neutrinos are fermions though, and are known to have mass. Do all particles, including massive ones, lose their momentum as they travel though expanding space, or are neutrinos somehow different?

My question is, how confident are we in the Lambda-CDM model? As physicists continue to work on this stuff and improve and modify the model, is the estimated age likely to change? And if so, how dramatically?

I.e., how certain are we that the Big Bang did not actually happen 14 billion years ago and that the Lambda-CDM model is just slightly off?

Could one theoretically manipulate such a gas in a meaningful way with magnets? I.e. if gas was placed in a hermetically sealed cylinder with some spinning magnets at the top and bottom, or on the sides or whatever, could you create a predictable vortex / any predictable fluid flow within the tube? Assuming you find some smart person to piece out all the complicated math of spinning magnetic fields and fluids etc.

I think I read before that the physical virus 'unit' doesn't stay in the body but after the first infection the genome/DNA for such virus is now integrated with yours and replicates anyway, only normally the genes are not expressed enough for symptoms or for cells to begin producing full viruses?

If I refrigerate a drink to 4c in a fridge and drink it, my body needs to burn more energy to maintain temperature and thus burns more energy in proportion to the volume and temperature of the colder fluid consumed.

So if I drink a cold drink vs a warm drink, am I effectively minimizing calories?

Ex. 1cup (250 ML) @ 4c requires 8,250 calories to be heated to body temperature of 37c

Text: Let's say we've got light entering a cubic piece of glass, at some angle less than 90 degrees.  When it enters, it will be bent at some angle relative to its original path.  When it exits, it will resume traveling at its original direction.  During this time it will also slow down.  (I watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUjt36SD3h8) video explanation as to how this process works.)

Photons have no mass, but they do carry momentum.

During the time the light is inside the glass (let's say it's a very short burst or a very large piece of glass), it's momentum vector is different than when it is traveling in the (for the sake of simplicity) vacuum outside.  I have no idea how its momentum is affected by the speed changes, but certainly it would be affected by the direction change.  And the conservation of momentum says that this momentum should be exchanged with the glass block.

Now obviously the amounts involved would be minuscule and likely undetectable, given any reasonable source of light and piece of glass.  But I'm trying to see if I understand the theory correctly.

Text: Hey folks.

Please correct me if I have any assumptions wrong. I have read articles about fusion and the time line of main sequence (?) stars. And so many times I have read that once a star starts producing iron, it is a dying star. From what I understand, the energy from fusing iron into heavier elements takes more energy than it gives out. For sure, a lot of the language I read is seemingly overly dramatic. I'm hoping that I can get some more precise information, on two points.

1. This is different from larger stars, correct?
2. What is the time frame for this 'iron death'? I would never assume that a star suddenly goes dark of course, I mean, it's laughable, if I can be funny for a second, the any iron in a main sequence star would kill it. As in, catapulting an anvil Wiley Coyote style will put out a star.

My assumption as that the H to He fusion and so on continues, for billions of years? I hope someone who knows these things can clarify the timeline for me. And thanks!

Where the water spread out and started drying it looked like the starch was shimmering, it did not happen in the more water rich slurries or when completely dry.

What's going on? Are there starch crystals falling out and refracting the light?

But how do they know which pixels are red, green or blue? Is the filter array aligned on the sensor with enough precision to know the exact colour of the filter above each pixel, or is there some element of the demosaicing algorithm that allows them to work out the filter above each pixel after production? Or is each sensor calibrated during production to locate the red, green and blue pixels?

if you did this regularly, would your immune system be better able to tackle real issues in the future? If so, why don't we do this? and if it wouldn't help, why?

edit: no im obviously not asking about vaccines. I'm not talking about vaccines created to train our immune system against a specific virus.

I'm asking if you're immune system will grow general defenses from simply allowing minor infections.

would strengthening your immune system against generic infections in paper cuts have any benefit to your immune systems abilities to fight other infections? Is there a limit to how *trained* your immune system can be for infection in general? or a specific infection? or specific types of infection?

ok so fine let's ask something about vaccines then. I've had all the generic vaccines that most people do. does that make my immune system better at fighting viruses in general? or only the ones I'm specifically vaxxed for.

But how can this be explained with a wave model as the dark bands (where waves &quot;cancel&quot; each other) would seem to say the energy from each wave just disappears at those spots? 

 (Whereas in Quantum Mechanics, I assume you would say the photons just don't hit those spots, but all photons do hit somewhere.  Which is also quite odd but at least consistent with energy conservation.)

Text: I believe I understand the basics of the process. 

You have a gene you want 'disabled', you engineer a specific DNA sequence that contains the neomycin-resistance gene from bacteria as a marker and pray it gets successfully incorporated into the genome of an embryonic stem cell (ESC) and 'knocks out' whatever gene you want through homologous recombination.

Afterwards you let the populations of ESCs grow a bit in culture. After a while, your petri dish contains some populations in which the process was successful and a whole lot in which it wasn't. That's where the neomycin-resistance gene comes into play; you add neomycin to the petri dish and soon it becomes obvious in which cells the homologous recombination was successful and in which it wasn't as the cells that didn't get the neomycin resistance gene die off. At least that's the way I understand it. 

However, how does neomycin kill these (eukaryotic) mouse cells? The way I understand it, neomycin should only be able to 'kill' bacterial cells as they specifically inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. What am I missing?

Text: I have a very basic understanding of how ML algorithms work — you feed them buckets of data, have them look for patterns in the data, and then attempt to generate new data based on those patterns. So I can see how you could give GPT-3 a topic and it could spit out a bunch of words commonly associated with that topic. What I understand less is how it combines those words into original sentences that actually make sense.

I know GPT-3 doesn’t have any sense of what it’s saying — like if I asked it to generate Tweets saying “Elon Musk is dumb”, it doesn’t know who Elon Musk is, what dumb is, or even what “is” is. But somehow it’s able to find information about Elon Musk, and formulate it into a sentence insulting his intelligence.

Can someone who knows more about the inner workings of GPT-3 or language models in general explain the “thought process” they go through when generating these responses?

Edit: I should also add that I understand how basic language models and sentence construction work. What I’m asking about specifically is how does it generate sentences that are relevant to a given topic, especially when there are modifiers on it (eg “write a song about Homer Simpson in the style of The Mountain Goats”)

Text: I'm sitting on my thesis for my history class for uni and analyzing some old local policies from 1718 (from a city government in Palatinate, germany) , which told the citizens to bring a light source with them if they wanted to go outside after a specific point in time in the evening. I was a little bit confused about the determined point of time, being 10pm in summer and 8pm in winter. I thought, why would they set the time that late in winter? Where I live in December at 5pm it's already dark outside. Why force the people to carry a lightsource not until 8pm? Why not already at 5pm when it's already dark especially without having electrical light at that time. That applies to the summer time as well? Why having to bring a lit lantern at 10pm when there is still enough daylight so you wouldn't need a lantern. At least from todays perspective. And on top of that it's even more confusing if you take in account that we have winter and summer time. In the past winter time would be the normal time (UTC+1). Hence my question: How consistent is  the yearly cycle of varying daylight duration from day to day throughout the year in a historical view? Was it the same in 16th century as today? Did it change throughout the millenia? And if so, how much did it change?

What i never see explained is:

Is each star within a galaxy assumed to be a point mass? Or do we see each star as a 3D object that has gravity that disipates from its own centre of mass and is less at its surface and progressively less effect as distance increases (to infinity)?

Do we &quot;simply&quot; count the stars, and their mass, and get that as the mass of the galaxy, and then based on its size, work out if it should be capable of staying together? Or do we model the individual stars and their gravity?

If we do model the individual stars, do we model their cumulative gravity to infinity too?

&amp;#x200B;

Short of reading research papers (which go waaaay over my head), none of the above is ever really explained on any documentary (traditional tv or youtube or podcast) that i have seen. Could somebody give me an idea of any of this?

Text: I've heard that for internal combustion engines, cold air makes the engine more efficient because it has a higher oxygen density. From my understanding, this is because more oxygen allows more fuel to be burned per unit volume, providing more power with each stroke. 

For an external combustion engine, is there any reason you would prefer cold air to hot air? As in, would air temperature affect the energy output of burning a fuel? Assuming 100% heat transfer from the fire to the boiler, can you make these engines more efficient by controlling the air temperature?

Text: Something has always bugged me with relatively... and that's... rotation. I can see how something moving up is mathematically the same as other stuff moving down... but rotation seems like it breaks that concept. 

If I stand in place, and do a 360 rotation, I'm spinning in place. But once we interpret it as, instead, the world revolving around me, it becomes a problem. Distant galaxies, following that wide arc, have traversed billions of lightyears a second, relative to my rotation. Just centripetal force alone should reduce them to dust. 

So how does relativity of motion reconcile with things rotating?

Text: To move something in space we have to generate thrust right? So to do that something has to be ejected in the opposite direction? Like gas or jet exhaust? 

Old school cathode ray tubes TVs shoot an electron beam, in a vacuum, guided by magnets at a phosphorescent material. These electrons then excite the pixels and produces photons. 

So assuming we cut off the display end of a tv and attached it to an item in space could the electron beam be able to move said object. 

Electrons are basically massless but if we had enough being shot out would the cumulative effect be enough to generate thrust in the opposite direction?

I’m not high I’m just not knowledgeable enough to figure it out.

Edit: Hi all, thank you for the replies. The bit about the + charge affecting the “spacecraft” and attracting what negatively charged particles may be in the vicinity, after a while, I hadn’t thought about. Makes total sense of course, additionally I had no idea ION thrusters were a thing. Lots to read up on.

Text:  I'm learning about different methods to create short, powerful pulses in lasers, and am currently learning methods Q-switching and Mode-locking. I have questions about both of them, spawned from reading lecture notes.

**The first questions have to do with Q-Switching:**

They have to do with this part of a reading my lecture notes:

&quot;In a Q-switched laser we stop the laser from oscillating by altering some property of the laser cavity (otherwise known as changing the cavity quality – hence Q!). As an example, we might use a device that misaligns the beam in the cavity preventing lasing. The cavity now has a low Q. This allows the population of the upper laser level to build up and means that the signal is not being fed back into the oscillator so no lasing occurs. A fast switch then changes the alignment of the cavity to a high Q value. This allows the oscillation to take place and the pulse to be released.&quot;

* Is my assumption right that, in order for this to be achieved, &quot;stopping the laser from oscillating&quot; refers to stopping photons from entering the gain medium, hitting a resonator, hitting the gain medium, hitting the other resonator? So, moving the resonator slightly will prevent that, as a photon will hit the resonator that's curved and not hit the other one since the trajectory doesn't allow for it (although that sounds classical.. and photons don't move classically). And what is the oscillator, in this case?
* From what I gather, this is my interpretation: if we tilt a resonator, the photons don't gain properly. This causes emitted photons to hit the gain medium, (The emitted photons from the pump, I'd assume... which I'm not sure if is pumped constantly or pulsed here.. since I know this has to do with pulse emission but I'll explain why I'm not sure if it's pulsed pumping or constant pumping) and then not oscillate back. This means less photons hit the gain, causing less stimulated emission and more electrons sitting at a lasing band, with their high decay time. So, without any incident photons, they're more likely to stay there. Then.. I suppose.. from adjusting the &quot;Q value&quot;, by aligning the mirror perfectly and fast, we get that needed amount of incident photons, and that cluster of lasing band electrons all undergo stimulated emission in close to at the same time? What gaps do I have in this?

**The second question has to do with Mode-locking**

Modelocking has to do with introducing a ton of longitudinal modes of different wavelengths into the cavity. These waves, when superposed, seem to tend to create one larger peak spike when added. This also appears in beats with sound. Why exactly is this? I've heard it may have something to do with Fourier analysis?

**Finally, I have three small questions on general pulse lasing**

Gain switching is described in my lecture notes as &quot;we simply control how long we supply energy to the laser for, and thus how long the laser remains above threshold for. As the laser only emits when the gain &gt; loss, so a pulse of light may be formed.&quot; How does this create a pulse? To me this sounds akin to holding my hand over a flashlight and then quickly removing and putting my hand back to cover it. This doesn't seem like when I remove my hand more light will come out, the same but for a different amount of time. Not more power or anything we think of with pulsed lasers. According to this diagram, Pulse-Repetition Frequency is defined as 1/Tinterval (Am I write in assuming an amount of displacement t on this graph is referred to as time bandwidth? If not, what is it?) Where is the intuition behind this?

[https://i.stack.imgur.com/aISLv.png](https://i.stack.imgur.com/aISLv.png)

One more question. Thanks very much for bearing with me. Am I right in assuming this graph has to do with the varied amounts of intensities with the necessary gain, when going through both resonators and through the gain medium, produce net output gain? What do those arrows represent, (lasing modes.. huh?) and what explains the general curved figure of the graph?

[https://i.stack.imgur.com/DhWO3.png](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DhWO3.png)

I appreciate any time taken to help answer these. I'm new to the subject but it's intriguing, so I'd like to know exactly what is going on so I can develop a sense of pride for this thing.

Text: As I understand it (with my PhD in astronomy, but not in cosmology specifically), cosmic expansion means that space-time itself is expanding. I get the whole &quot;inflating balloon&quot; analogy. OK.

I read things about how if the universe has &gt; critical density then it will collapse (again). Or even if it's subcritical, then it should at least be slowing down in its expansion (were it not for dark energy driving faster expansion, that is).

The explanation I typically see for an expected slowing of the expansion is that gravity is an attractive force — it should pull stuff back together. Most explanations I read tend to end there.

But **why** would you expect gravity to arrest the expansion of the universe in the first place? The expansion is **not** a conventional explosion away from a center. It's **not the case** that other galaxies are flying away with some kinetic energy that is being transformed in to gravitational potential energy. Rather, expansion is an isotropic inflation, where everything gets further away from everything else as space-time expands.

If a particular galaxy were to get pulled by gravity in a way that would cause the universe to &quot;slow down&quot; its expansion, then would direction would that be? There is no center of the universe. The gravitational forces acting on any galaxy should be (on average) isotropic (but for some clusters and large-scale structure, but I don't think that's relevant to this question).

**TL;DR** — The statement &quot;gravity \[should\] slow the universe's expansion&quot; appears fallacious to me, and yet I see it everywhere\*. **What I am misunderstanding?**

\* by everywhere I mean, e.g., [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2021/01/05/how-is-the-universe-accelerating-if-the-expansion-rate-is-dropping/?sh=385dbe044093), [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/expanding-universe-slows-then-speeds/), [Harvard](https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/supernova/newdata/fate.html), many others.

Text: It's well known that having a meal before consuming alcohol (ethanol in this context) slows down its absorption into the bloodstream. A quick google search pegs this at 50% reduced maximum BAC level compared to consuming alcohol on an empty stomach. Without chemistry knowledge, one might be inclined to believe that just about all of the alcohol eventually reaches the bloodstream.

I found out today that ethanol reacts with organic fats (carboxylics only?) to form esters, which do not appear to act like ethanol in the body.

My question is, is this likely to result in a significant decrease in the total amount of ethanol that eventually reaches the blood? If a person ate a fatty meal before drinking, is it possible this could reduce the bioavailability of the ethanol (if that's the right term) by &gt;20%?

Also that east Asian people are more likely to be lactose intolerant because of the relative lack of milk and cheese in their traditional diets.

Has anyone ever collected data on tobacco related illnesses in indigenous Americans? Sure, there are a ton of modern toxic substances in cigarettes now, but I wonder if they have a higher resistance to things like lung cancer caused by smoking?

Text: **Please read this entire post carefully and format your application appropriately.**

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/w3rut0/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxvii/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).
* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)
* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)
* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?
* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

\-------------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

`Username: /u/foretopsail`

`General field: Anthropology`

`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`

`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`

`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`

`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

You can submit your application by replying to this post.

Text: As the title mentions, based on casual observation, it seems to me that the effective dose of most medicine active ingredients is somewhere between 5 mg and 200 mg. There are of course exceptions like fentanyl which is incredibly potent at the scale of micrograms, and gabapentin, which is often dosed at over 1000 mg, but it seems like most medications are within a narrower range I mention above. This is surprising given vastly different molecular structures of the different medications.

My first question is, is my observation empirically accurate? Or, am I just noticing a non-representative subset of medications?

My second question is, if this is true, why? I know the range i mentioned is pretty large, but it seems narrow when considering total physically possible ranges? Why don’t we see more medications with effective dosages at the microgram scale?

One possibility that occurred to me- is this just a matter of practicality? Consuming multiple grams of medication, although possible, is inconvenient. Similarly, maybe its more expensive to manufacture super potent compounds because of the precision it requires. Are companies just choosing to develop products that work in a more convenient dosing range?

Another possibility that occurred to me- is there some law of chemistry or factor in our biology that makes this the ideal dosage range for many different compounds? E.g., the size of molecules limits potency, the body has some process that clears de minimis amounts of a compound, the average human weight somehow necessitates medications usually be in this range, etc.?

This question has been driving me crazy, so thanks to anyone who can provide some insight.

Text: I'm particularly interested Urushiol, the substance in Poison Oak/Ivy/Sumac that many people are allergic to.  
My understanding is that repeated exposure to some substances can cause someone to become allergic to it. However, repeated exposure to that same substance can make you immune, or at least non-reactive.   
I'm also not sure of the difference between being immune &amp; being non-reactive? I have read that only 0.5% of the population is truly immune to Poison Oak, while the rest who don't get it are only non-reactive, but can become reactive to it later.   


Lastly, Urushiol is made of a benzene ring with a hydrocarbon tail. I have read that the benzene ring in Poison Oak, Poison Ivy, &amp; Poison Sumac all have the same benzene ring, but slightly different hydrocarbon tail lengths. Would the different hydrocarbon tail lengths be enough to be allergic to one but not the other?  
Can someone help me understand this better? Thanks.

Text: I'm writing a story, and one of my characters who is intersex has a child at one point. I thought it would be poetic and be a great part of his arc if his kid was intersex like him, allowing him to guide his kid in a way he was never guided. However, considering how low the chances of obvious intersexuality are (which doesn't count very minor intersexuality or intersexuality that is entirely internal, and therefore unnoticeable), it would seem sort of contrived if his kid also happened to be intersex. However, if it's hereditary, that wouldn't be an issue. So how does that work, exactly?

Would the patient require to solely transplant the eyeball or would any nerves, like the optic nerve have to be transplanted too?

A follow-up question; In the TV series Babylon 5, a doctor is able to implant an artificial eye into a patient. The patient would see via a camera that transmitted to the optic nerve (IIRC). I don't recall if the eye-ball was artificially grown or not.

Funny enough the eyeball transmitter has some range so the eye could be ehm.. forgotten somewhere..for a while.

Text: From my very basic understanding so far, we had some bacterias in the warm ocean enjoying yummy photosynthesis and gasses, kinda screwed themselves over with that for a few years, but bounced back for the second half. I'm wondering how or why did they become multi-cellular and what could've been the first organisms we could actually see (with our own eyes not a microscope) mostly before the proterozoic period? I'd say we have some examples today, but I'm gonna assume our bacterias had their own evolution through time also.


Side rant- I wish we could've just stayed in the warm primordial soup so we don't have to pay taxes, but noo, we just had to enjoy land 🙄

(I'm still heavily learning but my new hyper fixation is learning about the earliest life, and for obvious reasons it's kinda hard to research something so long ago. And most of my knowledge is being built by small easy to follow informational vids on YouTube, like PBS Eons is one of my faves for example. But most stuff would be on prehistoric animal lines we could follow from today.) 

If you have any interesting videos or creators to share please let me know! I do have the attention span of a mentally set back squirrel but this is also something I'm very interested in, not just this but all prehistoric biology. I use TikTok and other social media's too so not just YouTube!

For a summer job I cleaned windows on high rises (look up rope access if you're interested) and from the outset my boss trained me to practice cleaning with both hands while learning so I could cover more area at once.

*tldr questions start here:*
Anyway, this got me thinking, when a surgeon is digging through a body cavity, are there any awkward spots? Do you ever find that you can't reach from a particular angle and the other hand reaches better? Is this really bad practice? Do you just reposition your paitient? Are there more reachy tools that do the trick? Ever been forced to abandon a procedure because you've realised you've come from the wrong angle? Are there any skills that you by default train yourself to do ambidextrous because it'll come in handy? Or is this never an issue?

So forgive the ramblings of this madman. Genuinely curious as to how this all works.

Text: I understand feet contain MORE nerve endings than hands do, or female nipples have equal numbers of nerve endings as male but less dense given larger volume, but I'm a little confused when trying to translate that over in a mind experiment about comparisons.

So it's a two pronged question;

\-At the first stage of life, birth or in utero or whatever, is an individual nerve in my feet IDENTICAL to one in my hands (or back or nipples or cheeks or whatever)

\-At the same time, is an individual nerve in MY body identical to one in an unrelated baby?

&amp;#x200B;

Basically trying to understand whether it's ONLY our experiences that factor into why two people (of identical bmi/height/whatever) rank the pain of an identical kick in the shin differently, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope it's clear what I mean - but since it's a mind experiment thing, don't hesitate to elaborate on what you THINK I'm asking because I'll still find the answer fascinating :)

Text: I know why its hot in the summer and cold in the winter here in Earth and I also understand why Mercury has the most radical diurnally changes in its tempereture, but I cant find any information about the temperature changes caused by Mercurys elliptical orbit.

The orbit seems to be much more elliptical than Earths orbit, which is quite circular and doesnt play any role in weather or tempereture, because the distance from the sun doesnt vary that much.

But mercurys distance varies much more.

I mean, surely it could have an affect right?

If you can find a graph related to this, it would be awesome, but any calculations or things like that are fine too. I just don't know where to start, and google doesnt help either.

Can someone please explain if all the aftershocks from the Earthquake (some we feel some we don't), can cause some activity in our area that can lead to a devastating earthquake because our buildings here are almost all unequipped and it would be impossible for us to cope with, I fear so much for my families and younger siblings to experience something like that god forbid. 

Please can anyone give me some reassurance or anything about if the aftershocks cause more or less stability in the area? Or anything else I need to know please. Thanks so much!

Text: Imagining a time where one couldn’t simply reference the periodic table, how would scientists have determined that something such as gold, once smelted and purified, was just one element, as opposed to being a compound? 

Water was thought of as classical element and of course we know now that it’s made of hydrogen and oxygen. I can imagine how we might figure that out by either combining the elements that make water or breaking water up into its elements, but how could we have been certain back in the day that substances like gold were elements and not just compounds that are really hard to break apart? Could we really have been completely certain of this before we had the technology to directly observe individual atoms?

This might be a bit more of a history question. Google didn’t give me any satisfactory answers, I don’t think it really understood the question I was trying to ask.

Text: So from my memory of thermodynamics, an ideal heat pump is the carnot cycle. This cycle uses an ideal gas on both the hot and cold sides of the pump. However in the real world we use the refridgeration cycle with an evaporator and a compressor.

I understand that the Carnot cycle is 'ideal' and therefore we can't get to Carnot efficiencies in real life.

But what real life factor means we can't try and use a gas both sides (with a turbine to replace the evaporator? Is it energy density? Cost? Complexity? Do space/military grade heat pumps with high performance requirements do something different?

Thanks!

Edit: just a quick edit to say thanks so much for all the responses so far, it's exactly the sort of detailed science and real world experience I wanted to understand and get a feeling for. I will try and respond to everyone shortly!

Edit2: bonus question and I think some commenters have already hinted at this: flip the question, what would it take / what would it look like to have an all-gas cycle and if money were no object could it outperform a phase change cycle? I'm assuming extremely high pressure nitrogen as the working fluid to achieve a good energy density... Enormous heat exchangers. Could it get closer to Carnot COPs?

Similarly, during the time I lived in student residence, outbreaks of it were common (and fleeting). People are usually quite sick for just a day or two in the typical dramatic noro fashion, and then become asymptomatic. 


Most other diseases' symptomatic periods tend to last about a week or more - like a cold, or some common flu, or even covid-19. Why is norovirus so quick, in comparison? Is this something to do with the nature of it infecting the GI as opposed to the respritory tract?

Text: Both online and in my physics courses I’ve seen two seemingly very different accounts for pressure in a fluid at hydrostatic equilibrium:

· The first posits that pressure is a macroscopic measure of the impacts of fluid particles on a surface submerged in the fluid. It is therefore a function of the temperature of the fluid and its density.

· The second explains pressure by the weight of the volume of fluid above each point. It therefore depends on its density and the depth in the fluid (or the altitude in the case of the atmosphere).

I can’t figure out how the two are related. The first explanation requires no gravity, while the second would imply zero pressure in a zero g environment. What am I missing? Is the first explanation only valid for gases and not liquids? And if so, why?

And on that note, I would also like to ask how the second explanation accounts for pressure being a scalar and not a vector: if it is merely the reaction force which balances the weight of the fluid above (per unit area), then why is it the same along axes perpendicular to the vertical?

Text: Most of the pop-sci explanations for dark matter that I've seen compare the light we detect from a galaxy with some observation of its mass: gravitational lensing, velocity, etc. There isn't enough light to explain the mass.

But how do we know that this isn't just a limitation of our instruments? Is it possible that there is enough light, but that it's just too faint to detect?

They can't be what the burnt object was because (according to what I've been told) all of the subjects &quot;information&quot; has been lost when it was burnt, and there is none left in the ashes and it can't be recovered.  If this is the case and ashes aren't any part of the original object, then what are they and why are they always the same?

According to the picture, the V at the ends is perfectly in phase with the E field (they peak when the E field peaks), but current is a quarter wavelength out of phase. Can somebody explain why the V at the ends is in phase with the E field, but the current is out of phase?

PBS Space Time! We've now been making this show for 7 years (!!!!) and have covered a LOT of physics and astrophysics. We also have big plans for the future of the show. AMA about anything Space Time.

The new astrophysics program I'm working on that will (hopefully!) map the region around 100's of supermassive black holes at Event Horizon Telescope resolution, using gravitational lensing, machine learning, and the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time. A &quot;side benefit&quot; of the project is that we may help resolve the crisis in cosmology with an independent measurement of the expansion history of the universe. AMA about black holes, quasars, lensing, cosmology, ML in astro LSST, and how we hope to bring it all together.

And finally, with some of my Space Time colleagues I'm working on a new feature-length documentary called Inventing Reality, in which I'll explore humanity's grand quest for the fundamental. It'll include a survey of our best scientific understanding of what Reality really is; but equally importantly, it'll be an investigation of the question itself, and what the answers mean for how we think about ourselves. AMA about reality! And the film, if you like. Ps. we're trying to fund it, just sayin': [www.indiegogo.com/projects/inventing-reality](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/inventing-reality)

Text: I've been reading on the history of transplants, and it seems that other than the massive amounts of surgical skill needed, you also needed to to get \*some\* way to make sure the organs aren't destroyed by the recipient's immune system. So which means, I got a question about the discovery of immune suppressives.

1. How do they find it out? I know how antibiotics are found. Plate the agar, and then put in the antibiotics. How do they test out immune tolerance? Do they just mix the blood containing white blood cells, and put in the donor cells, with evidence of donor cell destruction showing that the immune suppression didn't work? Or is there some thing else?
2. How do they create the specific immunosuppressive drug cocktail to prevent organ rejection. Obviously you can't just access and examine the kidney or heart while its inside you. How do they modulate the dose to maximise effectiveness?

In this he talks about a fascinating field of research in Animal behaviour, about how animals experience time - and how time is expressed in the perception of sound and motion.

Consider my mind blown.

Benn's video implies that the subjective perception of motion, and pitch of sound change for animals with varying levels of &quot;Critical flicker-fusion frequency&quot;.

Is this belief well backed by research? Are there any good places to learn more about &quot;CFF&quot;?

Text: What I mean is, if we have access to a normal breathing atmosphere through some sort of breathing apparatus, would our bodies otherwise tolerate being in an atmosphere (same pressure as normal) devoid of oxygen? The only answers I was able to produce while searching related to what happens to our bodies in space or on different planets, and that our skin doesn't &quot;breathe&quot;, but still absorbs oxygen. 

So just as an extreme example, if we were to find another planet with the same pressure and composition as ours but lacking oxygen, or if our own somehow ran out of oxygen, would there be a limit to how long we could stay outside without a suit, aside from the oxygen required to breathe?

Or in other words, what would happen to our bodies if the respiratory system was the only part of us that had access to oxygen (most of the time)?

Text: I genuinely tried my best to reaserch this on my own but couldn't find the information i need.

My    understanding is that EE2 is not like, say, Estradiol valerate or    estradiol hemihydrate just estradiol with something to transport it but a    different hormone. Is that correct?

I    looked at the chemical structure and wondered what it is that makes   EE2  interact differently with the (intracellular) estrogen   receptors(120%  at the ERalpha and 44% at the beta receptor; compared to   E2) [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Affinities\_of\_estrogen\_receptor\_ligands\_for\_the\_ER%CE%B1\_and\_ER%CE%B2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Affinities_of_estrogen_receptor_ligands_for_the_ER%CE%B1_and_ER%CE%B2)

Is it understood why that is? Is it possible for a hobbyist to understand the biochemical reason for that?

If anyone could explain this to me or give me a hint what so search for I would appreciate it. Thank you very much in advance.

Text: Sorry I can't think of how to best phrase this question, but I started thinking with a specific example:

Given a place with a moderate climate, it has been raining for two weeks solid, when the average monthly climate would have say 5 rainy days per month.

Does this say anything about what might come next in the last two weeks of the month? Would you expect those weeks to be less rainy (maybe if whatever circulation patterns exist simply don't support a full month of rain)? Or is it more random like flipping a coin where you can get heads 10 times in a row but the next flip is still 50/50?

I am (very clearly) not very clued up on these topics but hopefully someone gets the gist of my question!

Text: There's lots in the news about antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and I'm trying to get a more nuanced understanding of how bacteria develop resistance, and if they ever lose that resistance over time.  I know that, in the world of genetically engineered bacteria, it's hard to keep a trait stable over many generations of bacteria.  If the trait isn't necessary for the bacteria's survival, it often mutates away.  Genetic engineers often tie interesting traits to a separate trait for bacterial resistance, and then expose the bacteria to antibiotics to select (in theory) for just the bacteria that have an intact version of the special trait and the associated resistance.

I'm curious about what happens if you take a bacteria strain, like MRSA, that has evolved a resistance to drugs in the methicillin family, and then culture it in an environment where it's not exposed to any antibiotics.  Does the bacteria lose the resistance over generations?  How long does it take?  If the culture loses resistance over time, and then you expose the culture to methicillin again, does the culture re-gain resistance faster, than, say, a naive strain of S. aureus that's never developed resistance in the first place?  Is inherited resistance forever, or does it require continued exposure to antibiotics to maintain that resistance?  

Also, got any recommendations for good books about bacterial resistance?

Text: Going by the equation  G= M🜨/ (r🜨)² = (r🜨)(ρ🜨) (which I think is correct, I don't remember what source I got it from), a planet with twice the mass and twice the radius of the Earth (2/(2)²) would give a surface gravity of 0.5 G. All of this is to say that this hypothetical planet, despite being twice as massive and being twice as large, has a low surface gravity. This leads into my main question: would the low surface gravity mean that this body would have a low escape velocity or would the higher mass mean it would have a higher escape velocity than Earth?

If so, how big of an impact do earthquakes have on animals who don't live near buildings? I imagine animals that live in burrows would probably be threatened, but what about other animals? Do animals have any sort of response, or do they just kinda freak out? Do they get threatened by earthquakes that are threatening to human cities? What level of magnitude would pose a significant danger to animals?

Text: Male lions usually leave their pride when reahing sexual, either alone or as a coalition, seeking to take over a pride other males. This is a well known fact and simething you see in every nature documentary about lions. The question that has been bugging me for a while now is how are new prides formed? How does the net number of prides increase and how do lions (re)colonize new territories?

Do large prides occasionally split up? Or may wandering males link up with females that have left their pride for one reason or another, similar to what wolves do?

Any biologists, ecologists or zoologists here that know the facts on this? Are there any solid sources on this? When I look around online all I find is the same information about males taking over prides, which makes me want to find the answer even more.

I appreciate anyone who can help me scratch this itch.

When I view my part with a thermal camera,  I can see the electrical bits are all at the temperature that I would expect.  But the metal housing for the part is closer to 85C.  The unit was in the chamber for over an hour, so it should have been “soaked” by that time.  

I was talking to a coworker and he said that the hot air in the chamber was cooling the part because it was flowing.  But that didn’t make sense to me because I would think that air at 105C would make everything about 105C.  Why does hot air cool metal and reduce the temperature of the metal to below the temperature of the hot air?

Let's suppose we have a very long stick with astronomical length in the range of light years or similar.

This question has been proposed before but I wish to hear clarification on some facts that aren't clear to me.

If we push the stick 10 cm, does it mean the stick is 10 cm shorter before the push reaches the other end?

Is the strength we would have to apply to do that only the strength necessary to move the stick with its given length and mass or is it also needed to add additional force to transiently deform it if the previous question is yes?

Some previous data suggested that there's a short term (few weeks) boost in antibody titers of a similar magnitude to those seen with the original wild-type booster, but that those gains quickly evaporate back to a baseline antibody level from prior to the bivalent booster. Is there data separating the short and longer term benefits in terms of both transmission protection and hospitalization/death prevention? Bonus points for studies containing data specific to children and pregnant women.

Im a bit unsatisfied with this answer. How does brain run out of glycogen? Do neurons use more energy than what can be supplied to them? And how do they produce atp once you wake up if the breaking down of adenosine into inosine is what makes you wake up in the first place?

If anyone has further knowledge on the original question I'd be glad to hear it too.

Text: A quick search shows that a 2 month old baby can see around 12 inches away. What happens when they look at a mirror within that range? Can they see things across the room clearly, because the mirror itself is less than a foot away? Do things in the mirror look just as blurry as they would normally, since the object in the mirror is more than a foot away?

I noticed while changing my kid's diaper that he would stare really intently into the mirror on the wall just above the changing table. Sometimes it seemed like he was accurately tracking my wife moving around the room - through the mirror - even though she was way outside the normal limit of his vision. It could be that he was just tracking a sort of blobby movement (which he does a lot of anyway.) But his level of interest in the mirror is really intense.

(To add, because the mirror is so close and above him, I think he's able to see a lot of the room well, but not much of himself. I don't *think* he's just fascinated by his reflection, but that is obviously another real possibility)

Text: Hi there. I am not a geologist, and most of my knowledge has come from seminars on soils or reading online sources. So I am here to ask a question of geologists that I am having trouble finding online.

Lithification of marine sediments appears to be the most common process in the creation of sedimentary rock. It's quite easy to find information on this. However, I have found very little information on whether there are terrestrial processes that create sedimentary rock on land. One could assume that the relative absence of information means it doesn't happen, but I don't want to assume that just because I can't easily find the information means it doesn't happen. So, are there any types of sedimentary rock that form in terrestrial environments, and what are the processes? I have read about cements and conglomerates, are those typically the only ones?

Generally it seems that lithification happens in marine environments, the rock is then uplifted into the terrestrial environment, where it then erodes back to the sea. Does lithification generally not happen on land because the accumulation of new sediment is not enough to replace or overtake sediment loss to erosion?

I'd appreciate any pieces of information or sources on this. Thanks!

So I know that tsunamis can be formed through tectonic plates shifting (colliding), which is sometimes followed/caused by an earth quake, which then causes a tsunami. 

That-to me - is the basic way tsunamis are formed.

Text: TL.DR: Humans suffer during pregnancy, and many women die giving birth. Does that happen to other animals too? Are we too weak? 

My wife is pregnant (Yey!). She struggles with nausea and tiredness, and everything doctors say is normal during the first trimester. In addition, she is scared about the possibility of miscarriage, complications and, in general, medical difficulties that could endanger her health (and the baby's health). She has been reading a lot about how, in the past, many women died because of pregnancy complications or while giving birth. Today, we wondered: is that kind of thing normal in animals? 

I have never heard someone mention, &quot;oh yes, my dog died because of pregnancy complications&quot;. I have never heard of that happening in wild animals. Maybe I am incredibly ignorant because I live in a city, but I am curious if other animals also have some rough times with pregnancy.

Is that the case? Or is it simply that we humans are weak?

Basically, I would like to see some data on the infection rates of Flu and RSV between cohorts that recieved an mRNA vaccine for covid and those that did not. Ideally peer reviewed sources, but pre-order review could suffice (I can follow along until the paper is published). It may also be the case that it is too early in the flu season for such research to have been conducted, so I would also be interested in any ongoing studies. Lastly, I'm interested to learn about the methodology used to find these studies.

As I know COVID can be contentious, my agenda is to accrue compelling evidence to disprove my family member's assertions that rising flu and RSV infections are caused by &quot;the clot shot&quot;.

For transparency, I am double vaxxed and boosted, with another booster on the the way.

It sounds to me like altering the genetic structure of an organism by either removing or introducing DNA, or modifying existing genetic material in situ would go against natural selection, assuming a genetic error isn't being corrected, would it not?

I would think artificial selection also isn't necessarily biomimetic, given the role natural selection plays in biomimicry, correct?

Text: In discussions of fusion research online, I keep finding statements that the preferred fusion fuel is a combination of Deuterium and Tritium.  Deuterium is readily available in nature, but the Tritium has to be manufactured.  The commonly stated scheme is to bombard Lithium-6 with neutrons from the fusion reaction, which will (usually?) cause the Lithium-6 nucleus to split into Tritium plus an alpha particle.  What I can't understand is how this can produce enough Tritium to maintain fusion.  One D-T fusion reaction produces one neutron, and one neutron causes one Lithium-6 nucleus to produce a Tritium ion -- for this to work, it seems we are requiring perfect 100% efficiency of fusion neutrons producing Lithium fuel.  My engineering background refuses to believe it. 100% efficiency is a fantasy, some of those fusion neutrons are going to escape the Lithium blanket without reacting, and some will get involved in reactions that don't produce Tritium.  Thus the fuel cycle I keep seeing described can't possibly produce enough Tritium to keep fusion going indefinitely.  Is there some mechanism I haven't run across that produces extra Tritium or extra neutrons somehow?

I know environmental influences + cell type + other genes/genetic predispositions are definitely big factors, but it almost feels like a paradox to just call all mutations random, even though I know that to be true. 

To clarify, I'm not trying to challenge the idea that genetic mutations are random, I'm just trying to understand the framework, especially in the broader context of evolution.



Edit: Thanks everyone who's responded! This has pointed me in the direction of thinking more along the lines of distribution of cancers + mutations in general in different types of cells + in specific genes and considering the complex environmental causes/risk factors (?) of cell mutations, which feels more comprehensive and like I'm on the right track. I feel like I may need to go more in depth to understand this in the broad context of genetics + evolution, so I might have to look for some good (maybe basic, for now) reading materials or something.

Text:  

To to best of my understandings, photodetectors rely on the accompanying optics to select the wavelength of light incident on the detector, with the detector only determining the quantity of light hitting it.

For example filters in in a digital camera, or diffusion gratings in a spectrophotometer.

Are there any designs or principles by which a photodetector alone could provide information not just about the quantity of light hitting it, but the wavelength as well?

Text: A kinda morbid questing, since i plan on studying electrical engineering this question has been bugging me for some time. If i was to take like a brain of idk a human or a chimp and attach tiny electrodes to specific parts could i control it and move its limbs? Would this work on a dead person? Or maybe just connecting the electrodes to the muscles, like that one Micheal Reeves video. I know this sounds dumb and edgy but yeah  i need to know whenever or not this is possible

Isn't it possible for speed of light to have varied over time, of under influence of something like dark matter or dark energy? If it is not as constant as we suppose it is, then wouldn't it drastically change our understanding of the cosmos?

I was wondering what the undergoing mechanism/reason is behind that upper limit. 

Is there a cut off after which it can’t be metabolized properly or will it put unnecessary strain on the liver/kidneys ?
I’m aware that a possible danger would be elevated blood pressure due to osmolarity I think ?

Would love some links to papers/articles/book suggestions regarding this as well if some can be provided.

Text: I've gotten a number of vaccines through my life, most recently the Covid one and it got me thinking.

-why aren't vax shots done in the veins and arteries? Why the arm muscle? If it's in the vein, wouldn't that carry the &quot;product&quot; around faster?

-is the muscle and everything just mass covered with veins so that chances are the needles hit the veins anyways? 

-why are vaxes via needles and not tablets like antibiotics? 

-if the vax/needle is put in the arm/muscle, how does that product move around the body? Does our immune system just update our OS with the new info and its filed away?

-why the arm soreness? Is it because a needle pierced the muscle? If so, wouldn't that pain happen right away like stubbing a toe? Or does the arm hurt from the product? And why?

Hope these questions actually made sense! And thanks in advance!

Text: This is an idea I was curious about for a while, I'll give an example to further clarify what I mean

Let's say that we have a group of say, 500 individuals with a certain genetic disorder, for example short sightedness
Wouldn't it be possible to sequence their genes to find the ones they all have in common in order to get a cure?,  this obviously can also apply to any other mental or physical disorder

I know that it's much more complex than that and that several genes can cause the same problem, and it can also be created due to 2 or 3 unrelated genes clashing together, but the main question is if this method is feasible as a solution


Let's expand it further and say that we have sequenced more than a million individuals, would it be possible to average that in order to get an average human?

Text: It is straightforward to draw a graph of 10\^x where x varies from say -3 to +3 where the value of x is an integer. On this graph there are points where x is non-integer say 1.39794000867 and y is 25. There is a clear mental picture of what 10 squared is, 100 of course, but 10 multiplied by itself 1.397... times fits awkwardly into my mind.

I am interested in the way we conceive and use these notions. Logarithms work but 10\^1.39 has no meaning.

Is there some, maybe mystical, way of thinking about these things where they become meaningful?

Is there a literature about these kinds of things?

I know diseases like HIV are thought to come from primates, which makes sense: we're so closely related. But H5N1 infecting humans, sea lions, and _birds_? Sea lions are in an entirely different order from us, and birds in an entirely different class! All having distinct and sophisticated immune systems (at least I think birds have sophisticated immune systems?)

Is H5N1 atypical in terms of how it can cause infection in so many radically different species? Or are the animals infected by H5N1 more similar than I realize?

Text: Hi, I'm doing research for fun stuff.

From my understanding of [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-14199-x) article from Nature, the impact winter after the K-Pg meteor was caused by soot (and/or sulfur) in the atmosphere reducing sunlight penetration. And that the 10-ish years of the impact winter was much more responsible for the extinction event than the impact itself (ie. the sonic waves and tsunamis and heat and magnitude 11 earthquake and stuff).

I would like to figure out exactly what the timeline was for the world's recovery after K-Pg. This stuff is surprisingly hard to find, I swear.

I found a [figure](https://www.space.com/36239-dinosaur-killing-asteroid-strike-chicxulub-life-return.html) that said it took 30,000 years for the first microbes to start showing back up again. That feels weird. Why did the article say that the climate would be returned to normal after 10ish years but it still took 30,000 years for microbe life to return?

How long was it before the first big trees? How long until everything was more or less &quot;back to normal&quot; in terms of the presence of flora? Are we talking, like, 200 years or 200,000? At what point after K-Pg could I walk outside and see a green landscape?

Is this number different for fauna? Like, what's the earliest we saw animals thriving again?

I'm going crazy. If you're an expert I'd appreciate book recommendations or articles and whatnot. Point me in the right direction so I don't have to keep hasslin' you :)

Text: [Inspired by a Mastodon thread](https://mastodon.social/@sundogplanets/109876679977658045) by [Astronomy Professor Sam Lawler](https://www.uregina.ca/science/physics/people/faculty-research/samantha-lawler/index.html).

[Elon Musk plans 42,000 Starlink satellites](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-elon-musk-42000-starlink-satellites-earth-effects-stars-2020-10). With an operational lifespan of five years, after which they're de-orbited. We will have an average of 23 (42,000/(365*5)) satellites entering the Earth's atmosphere every day. 

[At 1,250 kg each (for the Starlink 2.0 satellites)](https://www.space.com/spacex-starship-deploy-starlink-satellites-pez-dispenser), that's 29 tons of satellites entering our atmosphere every day, much of that being aluminum. In other words, that will be almost 10,000 tons of aluminum effectively being aerosolized in our upper atmosphere every year.

Have there been any environmental impact studies of this?

Side note: For those who point out that we have two to three times more meteorites (by mass) entering our atmosphere than Starlink satellites, the meteorites are mostly silicates.

Also, unlike [geoengineering techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection) to inject aerosols into our atmosphere to combat global warming, we will have no effective way of shutting off the rain of Starlink satellites. Even if launches are stopped immediately, that's five years worth of satellites coming down. And without a &quot;smoking gun&quot; demonstrating the damages, SpaceX will likely continue launching those satellites to protect their revenue.

So if we considered all of the major histocompatibility genes and the # of known variants, how many unique immune signatures would we get? If the immune system sort of defines &quot;self&quot;, does this then give us an upper bound of the number of unique &quot;selves&quot;?

Here's a quote from The Song of the Cell talking about the variants:

&gt; Humans have multiple “classical” major histocompatibility genes, and potentially many others, of which at least three, and possibly more, are strongly related to graft compatibility versus rejection. One gene, called HLA-A, has more than a thousand variants, some common and some very rare. You inherit one such variant from your mother and one from your father. A second such gene, HLA-B, also has thousands of variants. You might have guessed already that the number of permutations between just two such highly variable genes is mind-boggling. The chances that you’d share such a barcode with a random stranger you met in a bar are vanishingly small (and all the more reason not to fuse with him or her).”

Text: On the most recent episode of [Volts](https://open.substack.com/pub/davidroberts/p/taking-carbon-out-of-the-air-and), they discussed CO2 sequestration in concrete. The claim is that injecting CO2 into the cement/concrete mixing process increases its compressive strength. According to this literature review from [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21148-w), &quot;CO2 curing can decrease the compressive strength of CCU concrete when compared to conventional concrete.&quot; 

If CO2 injection strengthens concrete, then it might be a real candidate for long term carbon sequestration. The incentives align. If it doesn't, it will be difficult to get concrete manufacturers on board at scale.

Text: Dinosaurs, enormous birds, giant sloths — there used to be an abundance of huge organisms compared to the size range covered across species today. I've often heard the ability for organisms to grow to such sizes is correlated with higher concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere, is this accurate? And beyond that, for organisms that grew to be so massive, did they simply contain a larger number of cells not much different from the animal and plant cells we see today (granted there's variation within those categories), or were individual cells also larger themselves? Perhaps the surface area to volume ratio could have differed based on oxygen availability and thus enhanced cell transport?

Text: Hi, all.

First of all, apologies if my question is kind of naïve, or even dumb. I'm not that smart of a person, and I just know the basics in most science fields. Just think of me as a 5 year old trying to understand the world around him.

I'm trying to understand the twin paradox, and I've stumbled upon [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-z_zRcLGAk&amp;ab_channel=ScienceEtonnante) (in french, but automatic English translation is quite good), where he explains that the paradox is resolved by the fact that the situations of the two twins are not really symmetrical, despite of what we think, because the traveling twin has to U-turn at some point, and doing so subjects him to an acceleration (at [16:11](https://youtu.be/T-z_zRcLGAk?t=971)). So, in short, it's because he has to accelerate at some point (to U-turn) that their situations are not symmetrical, and that he is indeed the one that age less.

After that, in relativity, there is no more any notion of simultaneity, which is why the traveling twin is not getting younger (or the Earth-one older) suddenly at the exact moment of the U-turn. This part I'm having a lot of trouble grasping, but that's not the point of my question.

So, I have two question about all this:

* Is his explanation &quot;correct&quot;, or at least does it give the right insight about the whole thing? If not, how does this really work?
* If he's right, and the acceleration is the root of the age difference at the end, what would happen in this hypothesis:

&gt; We are in an infinite universe without borders, where if you travel long enough straight forward, you come back to your starting point from the other side. The traveling twin hops in his rocket, take off and travel straight forward until he comes back to Earth (which has magically stayed in the same place and still exists, don't question it too far) from the other side. He has not made any U-turn, so in theory, I guess their situations are still symmetrical.

Which one would have age more, and why?

They are discovering that the presence of these strings allows for immunity against viruses to be passed down. What it hasn't explained is how this strings' presence provides that immunity. Or, if they did, I didn't understand it. 

I infer that the presence of the string tells the attacking virus &quot;I've already been infected&quot; and so it leaves it alone. I'm anthropomorphizing, but not sure the better way to describe it. Am I correct? Or is there more going on here?

Text: I might be misunderstanding the concept, but:

If the goldilocks zone is just the sweet spot away from a star that could sustain life, is it possible for that zone to shift as the star goes through different life stages? Or possibly life might evolve differently at different distances?

Does this have a place in our modern understanding?

Update/Follow Up Question: There seems to be a consensus in the thread that this is a valid concept. So...could that mean...we evolved as scientists think we did but maybe we did that on another planet in our our system and had to move to Earth when the goldilocks zone shifted? 

....maybe? Even in a &quot;plausible sci fi&quot; way?

Or is the change over too many billions of years to make any sense?

Text: For example, in additive mixing, red plus green make yellow, correct? I always see it talked about in terms of light that is already overlapping, and how that would affect the rate at which sensors in your eye would fire... so, let's  say I have two really bright LEDs, one red and one green, and I start to bring them closer and closer together. At what point will I start seeing, e.g. yellow light? Does this question contain a misconception?  


What about practical or visual demonstrations that also measure the distance required, in terms of things like intensity, for example?  


If you have a red light source on one eye and a green light source on the other eye and they are made to overlap, what colour(s) would you see?

  
I  suppose one could also look at the distance between the components of multicoloured LEDs to get an idea of when they are definitely close enough... but when would they be too far apart?   


My question is meant to be about how the underlying physics relates to compound colour perception. I'm curious about the specific values of the underlying parameters (whichever may be relevant) in common day-to-day situations, at which you'd experience a perceptual transition (e.g. going from seeing &quot;definitely red and green&quot; to seeing &quot;definitely yellow&quot;).

Why is there an AIDS pandemic but not a leishmaniasis pandemic?

Since leishmania can infect vertebrates and be spread by insects (and HIV can only infect humans and can't be spread by insects), what makes leishmania less infectious than HIV?

What makes leishmaniasis an easier disease to treat than AIDS?

Text: I understand the basic concept. It takes a long time for light to traverse great distances, which means the furthest objects in the observable universe are also the oldest.

The question is more about how this light is only now reaching us. If the universe expanded slower than the speed of light EM from this time would have passed us already. If it expanded faster, the light would never catch up. I doesn't seem like we should be able to see anything at all.

A search suggests this is possible because of a phenomenon called hyperinflation. The early universe was hot and dense, expanding faster than the speed of light. However, explanations of hyperinflation seem to indicate that it only lasted a few seconds immediately following the big bang, so this would have nothing to do with light from early stars.

Is heat and density the key here? I know it takes about 100,000 years for light created in the core of the sun to reach the surface. Are we talking about light that was trapped and released as the universe expanded and cooled?

Text: I was thinking about the problem of lifting a space craft from the earth's surface to space and for some reason only just now realized that there's an optimization problem here (I think) and I'm curious what the model looks like for this and how it's performed. Suppose I want to lift a mass to an orbit of some altitude, I can compute what energy the system has to have once it's in orbit; what's the best way to generate that?   


Suppose you launch with low power; then you spend more time in a higher gravitational field which means you're counteracting gravity for a longer period of time. I assume that minimizing the integral over time of the force of gravity on the vehicle would save you fuel, which saves weight which saves you fuel... (I assume this converges)  


Suppose you launch with very high power; you accelerate quickly out of the gravitational force but then air resistance becomes an issue and with too much velocity any additional increase in velocity requires O(x\^3) power. At some point it's not efficient to add more power because you'll need a lot more fuel.   


In both of these cases the higher you are the lower those forces are; so maybe a launch system which has a lot more power early and cuts the power later is useful (SRBs are useful here).   


Now, if you build a rocket or launch system with more engines you incur more weight that you're trying to move, also bad. Along with this is the weight of the fuel which goes down over time. The more fuel you have also starts to incur more non-usable weight for the fuel tanks.   


I presume that the effects of wind resistance and gravity create non-linearities in the system since the forces acting at time t are functions of altitude. Is there a model that's used to get started and then iterated on once certain discrete parameters are figured in (that is, you can't add 0.5 engines)?

Edit: I’m familiar with both KSP and the rocket equation. The problem of designing the system seems like a optimizing a function described by a non-linear differential equation which I assume probably doesn’t have an analytical solution. I’m curious about what things get modeled and which don’t and how this is actually done in practice.

Seems that not having to use it's own reentry vehicle would reduce mission costs, or allow for more or bigger scientific equipment to be carried on the probe.

Am I mistaken here or would this not be a nice effective use of having a continuously manned space vehicle in orbit?

Humans have bacteria in the bowel and some other organs as well inside their bodies. Despite these organs are considered 'the outside' in humans (the digestive tract is just a tube of 'the outside' that goes across our body), they have a characteristic microbiome that mostly only lives there and plays a role in life.

To sum up, my question here is: do plants have bacteria inside them? Like going across their trunks and the sap or even inside the leaves?

Text: I understrand that retroviruses use reverse transcription to make a DNA copy of their genome to integrate into the host genome. But pararetroviruses already have DNA as genome, so why make RNA to reverse transcript it back into DNA again? Also what happens after DNA is formed after reverse transcription, how does it help with amplification of the virus? 

Thank you in advance.

EDIT: found my answer in the book Principles of Molecular Virology by Alan J. Cann.

&gt; MLD is caused by a lack of the enzyme Arylsulfatase-A. Without this enzyme, substances called sulphatides build up, eventually destroying the protective myelin sheath of the nervous system. As a result, the nerves in the brain and the peripheral nerves cease to function properly 

The disorder is called metachromatic leukodystrophy and affects mainly the myelin sheaths that surround nerve cell tracts, due to a build up of sulfatides in the cell's lysosomes (organelles that contain digestive enzyme to degrade various stuff in cells). It stands to reason that with this disorder, every cell in the body lacks the required enzyme to clear them. How is a cure achieved simply by using a lentiviral vector to edit the blood stem cells that live in the marrow? How is that gene edit then 'passed on' to neurons and other cells?

Text: Each generation back, the number of individuals doubles (two parents, four grandparents, etc.), but eventually, the same individuals start to appear in multiple parts of your family tree, since otherwise you’d be exceeding the population of the world. So the number of unique individuals in each generation grows at first before eventually shrinking. How many unique individuals can we expect in the ‘widest’ generation?

Edit: I’ve found the topic of [pedigree collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedigree_collapse), which is relevant to my question.

Edit 2: [Here's](https://www.straightdope.com/21341588/2-4-8-16-how-can-you-always-have-more-ancestors-as-you-go-back-in-time) an old blog post which provides one example of an answer. For a typical English child born in 1947, &quot;the maximum number of “real” ancestors occurs around 1200 AD — 2 million, some 80 percent of the population of England.&quot; [Here's](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/01/your-family-past-present-and-future.html) another post that delves into the concept more. England is more isolated than mainland Europe or elsewhere in the world, so it'd be interesting if these calculations have been done for other places.

Text: First of all, I will begin with a copy paste from one source I've read from, which led me to frustration because I think it's plainly wrong.

 &quot;Abyssal Zone: This zone is a continuation of the benthic zone from 4,000 m and below, making it the deepest, darkest, and coldest region in the ocean, which also has the most pressure. Additionally, it has the highest oxygen concentration because more oxygen can dissolve in cold water than in hot water.&quot;

First, abyssal zone is not a continuation of the benthic zone by any means, since the benthic zone is the ocean floor...abyssal zone should be one of the pelagic zones of the open ocean....

Second, even though it is true that oxygen dissolves more in cold water than in hot water, other sources confirmed my doubts by saying there is **barely** any oxygen in the abyssal zone due to no light penetrating which means no photosynthesis.

Can you clear or confirm my doubts? Is the source spreading misinformation?

Text: For the record, I am a 1st Year College Student who is taking a Chemistry class. This was a practice question I was extremely curious and wanted to learn more about.

We were practicing fairly basic chemical equations in my Chemistry class when the equation of Fe3O4(s) + H2(g) -&gt; Fe(l) + H2O came up. Fairly simple in terms of chemical balancing, but the actual mechanics of the reaction confused me. I cannot find any explanation of this reaction anywhere I look.

My assumption would be that Iron(II,III) Oxide, when heated to near its melting point, becomes reactive enough to interact with hydrogen gas in the air, stripping it of Oxygen atoms and forming water vapor, thus creating pure Iron which then melts due to having a lower melting point than Iron(II,III) Oxide. However I am unsure and can't find anything to back this claim/assumption.

If anyone more capable in this subject then me could answer my question I would be extremely grateful.

Text: I understand that the body can use carbs and/or fat as an energy source during exercise, in differing proportions depending on intensity, but what does “burning fat” during exercise actually mean, and how is it different to actually losing fat?

If you do a long, low intensity workout where your body predominantly uses fat as its fuel source, will your body fat percentage be lower when you’re done? Is your body burning fat for fuel the same thing as when it loses fat due to a calorie deficit?

EDIT: I stand corrected. ~~Plutonium doesn't go critical until a huge amount of energy has been transferred into it, as it would when a shell of shaped charges that surround it explode all at once. I will delete this post once I am sufficiently satiated by its engagement and insights.~~

EDIT 2: Every day is a new lesson learned. The process of inducing criticality is very very complex. Could someone please write an accurate, succinct summary of how plutonium criticality is achieved so I could put it here?

EDIT 3: I would like to sincerely thank everyone for their insight. From everything I'm gathering in the comments (and please feel free to correct me as necessary):  

Tl;dr plutonium is *compressed* into a very compact density by a precise configuration of explosive &quot;lenses&quot; (shaped charges) in a nuke. Once this density is achieved, the mass achieves criticality. The plutonium itself doesn't go critical until it's either been compacted to such a density that its own radiation will energize it to a point of no return, or as with the &quot;dragon's tail&quot; experiment when a core was made critical by reflecting its own radiation back into it, which in turn caused a chain reaction.

PostTime: 1674096136

Text: Background:

Friend says turbo engines (typically) run lower *compression ratio* than naturally aspirated engines, and concluded turbocharged engines don't require as high of octane as an NA engine of the same compression ratio.

From my experience with ECU tuning, I know that maximum Manifold Absoulute pressure is often (roughly) double in turbo engines compared to NA (NA is retricted to atmospheric pressure: 1ATM/~14.7psi/~1013mbar)

Question:

*Assume all variables &amp; designs (power, fuel economy, displacement) are the same *EXCEPT* for compression ratio, peak MA pressure (MAP), and means of induction.*

Does a turbocharged engine produce higher cylinder pressure than a naturally aspirated engine?

Additional question:

Assume the same scenario as above, but now compare at an equivalent MA pressure. Say both engines cylinder pressure is measured when both engines are at 1ATM (maximum MAP for NA, but typically half maximum MAP for a turbo engine)

In this scenario, which engine will have a higher cylinder pressure?

Text: Suppose you have two conducting metal spheres with the same negative charge, however, one has a radius twice that of the other's. If I wanted to determine the electric field at a point away from the center of each sphere, which sphere would should have a larger calculated electric field? 

When using the electric field formula E=kq/r\^2, it seems that the radius of the sphere shouldn't have an effect on the calculated electric field. Is there a chance that the r in the equation in this case would actually represent the distance between the surface of the sphere and the point, rather than the center?

Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks :)

I'm assuming they instinctually go for safe places where they won't be bothered or affected by weather, and perhaps places that are relatively warm and solitary. I've been led by Hollywood to believe bears hibernate exclusively in caves, but I've lived in places with lots of bears and it's flat forest land as far as the eye can see (Florida). I know there are limestone cave systems, but they're far and few between in most places. I'm just wondering where else in the woods is a good, safe, warm, sheltered, protected, viable place for them to go to sleep for 6 months. Thickets? Fallen tree mounds? Do they dig holes for themselves?Unless they all crowd in together there just aren't enough caves for all of them! Where do the beers sleep???

Text: From my understanding, a photon is essentially a self-propagating oscillation in the electromagnetic field, with the electric and magnetic components out of phase with each-other by 90 degrees. Due to the way in which a changing magnetic field induces an electric field and vice-versa, this combined oscillation ends up propagating through space at the speed of light.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is: Do Gluons, W and Z bosons and the Higgs boson propagate via similar methods to the photon but just using different fields, or is their method of propagation completely different? The other types of bosons feel so mysterious to me in comparison to photons, so I'd love to learn more about how they work

Text: While most people know immune system is capable of rejecting transplants and encasing things like bullets in the body, what I've never seen explained is how the immune system knows what is or isn't part of your own body? I'm aware there's a period early in development where it &quot;learns&quot; this information but what is the actual mechanism of this learning, and later on, detection?

Text: I have been wondering lately what the theoretical top speed of a helicopter would be. I have a basic understanding of retreating blade stalls and keep seeing it listed as one of the main limitations to a helicopters top speed, along with the advancing blade eventually breaking the speed of sound creating shockwaves and the more obvious ones like drag.

In theory if we imagine we have a helicopter with an infinitely powerful engine and made of materials that would never be damaged from heat or the forces caused by flying at high speeds, would these limits still apply? If it is a coaxial helicopter then the retreating blade stall shouldn't be a problem as it would be stalling on opposite sides at the same time and if the rotors are made of this theoretical material the shockwaves wouldn't damage them. Would this theoretical helicopter still have some hard limit to the maximum speed it could achieve?

I tried treading up on this, but I'm not a physicist and I'm only familiar with QM on a podcast / youtube video level so I'm looking for a more intuitive explanation on why this happens and how this is derived.

- Does the existence of a magnetic monopole imply that the magnetic charge is also quantized?
- Is this a fundamental explanation on why things are quantum in nature or do we have to go deeper than that?

Text: Hello. I was having a discussion with a friend about snakes and how they go about digesting their food. We kept using the frame of reference that food goes in through our mouths, then through the digestive tracks of the stomach, then eventually out. We figured snakes were the same way, except their digestive tracks are part of their elongated bodies.

Then I started wondering, does food go in one direction then? Is it through the mouth, then slowly pushing toward the tail, where their output mechanism gets rid of it? Or is it through time, the food shifts from going outward towards the tail and upward towards the head, almost like a thrashing, until the food is broken up enough to exit the system?

I'm not sure of these answers. This might be a dumb question on my part. Just curious though.

How do snakes digest their food?

Do snakes use a more powerful acid they have to break down food than humans have?  Is there a rate at which the average snake passes food matter from one stage to the next? If so, how does that rate compare with humans, as its a smaller system?

I'd figure if that were the case, it would be a shorter time span to eat and output waste for a snake, than it is a human, but then again, that could be wrong, maybe its not relative to the size of the system, but the differences in the digestion process from snake to human and back. Who knows?

Might as well ask yall though lol. I'm not a herpetologist but one of you biology folks might be.

Morphine is known for not being affective administered IM in patients with Hypovolemic shock due to the fact that they have poor circulation so the medication stays localized and can even be fatal once a patients circulation improves. therefore would Diazepam or atropine or 2 Pam- chloride for that matter effect vasoconstriction or dilation in a way that using an IM administration practical or is it more of a case of &quot;better than nothing.&quot;

Like would they know that's their mom or dad or sibling?
Like do the animals have some kinda scent they give off to know that this is my litter mate... Whereas they could run across another golden retriever completely unrelated and know that it's not their family?  Or let's say the other dog had the same parent dogs but not of the same litter, can they recognize the connection at least that they have the same parents?

Text: Weird worldbuilding question! Lets assume that somehow seasonal variation ends, and we have constant spring-like temperature the whole year round. would there be any plant species that die off because they require the drop in temperatures as part of their life-cycle? as a signal to go to seed for example, or something else I'm not thinking of.

Text: So if you take a muon at rest and wait for it to decay, it will turn into a muon neutrino and a W- boson that will become an electron, anti-electron neutrino pair. The total kinetic energy of the three produced particles must be equal to the rest mass of the muon minus the rest mass of the electron. I presume that the neutrino rest masses can be assumed to be negligible.

How is this energy split up between the three particles? Is there an even energy split between the muon neutrino and the W- boson?

My thoughts on this so far are such that the electron can not possibly have more momentum than the other two particles, but due to the colossal difference in mass, I presume that the neutrinos would take at least a reasonable proportion of the energy between them.

How does this all work?

Text: Most sites are giving me mixed answers. I know some of it does overlap, but I can't find a clear answer. Moreover, is hydrogen bomb more powerful and destructive than a nuclear bomb? I'd like to learn more clear distinctions between these weapons and how destructive they can be as a comparison in terms of, say, size/weight/amount of material in the bomb vs size/area covered/extent of explosion, if that makes sense. Thanks in advance!

I’ve come across the concept of using pig hearts for transplants, but not many other animals in general. 

This got me wondering: What is the scientific reasoning was for choosing pigs as opposed to a different animal like a cow, or some other?

I wasn’t sure whether the flair would fall under human body or biology. :)

Text:  It's my understanding that each cell has a limited life span in part to avoid issues with cell division and so they die cleanly (I think it's called apoptosis, though that may only be when the immune system tells it to die)

I know that neurogenesis is somewhat debated but I couldn't find answers as to whether neurons naturally died without an external factor such as injury, disease, or the like.

If they do naturally die of old age what's a neuron's life expectancy?

If they don't then how long do they life on average before degenerative diseases or the like kill them?

Why does perforating the conductor with slits prevent these currents? Wouldn't smaller loops form and still have the same net braking force. 

I'm using this MIT pendulum example to show what I mean. The pendulum with slits doesn't brake. 

Do Eddy currents have a minimum size? If so what determines the size?

The distinction between ionic and metallic bonding is clear enough. 

But what is it about sulfur? Why do certain elements “love” sulfur but not oxide or silicate anions? What characteristic of the sulfide bond makes metal-sulfides behave different from ordinary ionic compounds? 

Does it have to do with sulfide being a larger, “softer” (more polarizable) anion than oxide?

What would happen if there were a higher  prevalence of IgG4 from a theoretical medical perspective? What would  the effects on defending against viruses be?
