It\'s a good place to network with people who share your interests!\\n\\n\\\\-------------------\\n\\n**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**\\n\\n* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,\\n* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.\\n\\n\\\\-------------------\\n\\n**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**\\n\\n* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).\\n* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)\\n* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)\\n* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?\\n* Provide links to comments you\'ve made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.\\n\\n\\\\-------------------\\n\\nIdeally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.\\n\\nHere\'s an example application:\\n\\n`Username: /u/foretopsail`\\n\\n`General field: Anthropology`\\n\\n`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`\\n\\n`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`\\n\\n`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`\\n\\n`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`\\n\\nPlease do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We\'re not going to do real-life background checks - we\'re just asking for reddit\'s best behavior.

My first console was the 8-Bit NES, then came the SNES and SEGA Genesis whose cartridges were a bit smaller but held more data, then the Nintendo 64 with cartridges still smaller and still more powerful.  Handheld systems were the same; Game Boy Advance cartridges could hold more data than original Game Boy cartridges while also being smaller, while DS cartridges were smaller and mightier still.  Upgraded versions of SNES games could fit on GBA cartridges, while upgraded versions of N64 games could fit on DS cartridges, and upgraded versions of GameCube and Wii games could fit on 3DS cartridges.  There have been some deviations from the \\u201csmaller and more data-rich\\u201d trends; for example the GameCube used miniature CDs while the following Wii and Wii-U used regular-sized CDs, but then it was back to cartridges for the Switch, and ones nearly as small as 3DS cartridges, to boot!  The home computer industry is similar; a USB stick holds a lot more data than floppy disks did, and external hard drives I can buy now have a lot more space than the larger, internal hard drive my PC shipped with.\\n\\nImpressive development, but I do often wonder how far this can go.  I know next to nothing about the mechanics of computer hardware (come to think of it, I\\u2019m not sure if this should really be tagged as computing rather than engineering), so I have no idea how hard it is to keep condensing all of this data capacity into smaller and smaller packages.

I\'m having trouble properly understanding the concept of PCA. As far as I\'m aware and can put into words, PC1 represents the biggest portion of variance in the data, folllowed by PC2? Meaning differences along the x axis have more weight than differences along the y axis. But I can\'t seem to properly grasp the meaning of these axes as anything tangible.\\n2.

I\'m aware that stem cells differentiate into the types of cells that need to be presented in the body from certain centres, and that they actually stick around with us all our lives. Now they are able to be used to restore a friend\'s knees back to an amazing degree (though not perfect). But if you received stem cell therapy from stem cells harvested from you when you were younger and put on ice, would the therapies be more effective? Is there a scientific reason to limit the number of rounds of stem cell therapy you can do, and would fully restored joints have virtually the same effective lifetime as the amount of time it took to get arthritis in the first place since adulthood?\\n\\nI think these questions could be answered by understanding more about stem cells, their life cycles, and their continued availability in our bodies for treatments in later life or in times of need.\\n\\nAlso, is there a way to differentiate the fields of stem cell research looking into stem cells in our bodies day-to-day or those in foetuses? I hate to see people get hung up on the stem cell research debate by citing the morality of biopsying foetuses, when we could be researching the stem cells we live with everyday and celebrating groundbreaking advances in treatments and therapies.\\n\\nIt has actually given me incredible hopes for the future to see how effectively my friend bounced back after 2 rounds of stem cell therapy, and I\'m saddened to not see more people I know with serious arthritis not look into the therapy. Is there something inherently prohibitive to the procedures? Surely: biopsy. Isolate. Culture. Get patient. Knock out. Poke where bad. Bed rest. Has the potential to be incredibly cost-effective and rapid.\\n\\nIn regard to Alzheimer\'s treatment: I\'ve heard and observed that Alzheimer\'s is a form of dementia resulting from physical deterioration of the brain. Why not poke with a large dose with the appropriate stem cells?\\n\\nThis is a lot I know, if it\'s too much to explain I\'m open to doing some extra reading.

However, there have been incidents of hypergolic-fuelled rockets crashing or expending contaminated stages, releasing bright orange clouds of N2O4 into the environment, including in proximity to populated areas. When these accidents occur, the relevant governments are usually pretty hush-hush about the whole incident, so it\'s difficult to what exactly happens to these populated areas after a local contamination. Incidents recorded by NASA in America seem to only be relatively minor spills occurring during fuelling of planes or rockets, not full-on environmental contamination.\\n\\nTo be more specific about my question if it\'s necessary. If a large quantity (let\'s say, a full rocket tank, 200 tonnes) of N2O4 (or something similar) is released into the atmosphere just above a town, how difficult is it to contain and/or clean? Is it so bad that the soil and water are made irreperably carcinogenic for years? Or can it be acceptably cleaned up before the end of next month? Or maybe we can just wait for it to \'decay\' and it will go away on its own? I\'m not a chemistry expert, so I don\'t know, and I don\'t where how to find out.\\n\\nThe reason I\'m asking is because I want to write a story featuring a hypergolic-fuelled rocket exploding above a town. I want to make sure I get every fact correct. I know that the N2O4 will explode on contact with alcohols (and apparently also paper and adhesives) and start fires, but I\'m more concerned about the chemical contamination. How quickly could people live in that town again?\\n\\nIf I got the post flare wrong, please let me know.

I\'ve heard a couple of answers which I\'m not convinced by, so thought I\'d get some clarity.\\n\\n* Resonating bonds between atoms in molecules.  This sounds semi plausible, but it doesn\'t account for handedness, where (AIUI) for instance a left hand identical arrangement of atoms smells of lemon and the same atoms arranged right-handed smell of mint.\\n\\n* That suggests shape is the driver, which seems compelling, but then why do brand new molecules we never evolved for have a smell?  Not perfume blends, that\'s obvious, but molecularly.  If we don\'t have a receptor for a molecule shape, how could we smell it, and how could we evolve a receptor for something that doesn\'t exist?\\n\\n* Smell buds, and every aroma is a unique combination of the nose equivalent of bitter/sweet/salt/acid/umami.  This seems pretty unconvincing to me as with shape alone - how could novel molecules smell?\\n\\n* Nose as a diffraction column.  Doesn\'t seem intuitive, but unique graphs for aromas at least includes the possibility of novel molecules having a smell, but we return to the handedness question.\\n\\nWhat am I missing?  Am I overthinking it all, missing something obvious?

A person who has spent most of his life in towns at 2-2.5 km above sea level\\n2. A person who has always lived in coastal cities\\n\\nAnd suppose both athletes are capable of doing the same sports with identical performance in their hometowns.\\n\\nI agree that the high-altitude athlete would have the advantage when competing, regardless of whether the athletes were competing at sea level or at high altitude, but suppose we were to have a way to accurately measure peak strength and endurance as two separate parameters.\\n\\nHow big would the advantage (in each of the two parameters) realistically be in favour of the high-altitude athlete, if both of them were competing at mean sea level?

Each of these very complex and has multicellular structure (except blood).\\n\\nI see how having a circulation system gives an organism an advantage but not how we got here.\\n\\nThe only explanation I have found on the Internet is that we can see genetic similarities between us and organisms without a circulation system but that feels very weak evidence.\\n\\nTo my computer science brain evolution feels like making a series of small tweaks to a computer program, changing a variable or adding a line of code. Adding a circulation system feels a lot more than a tweak and would be the equivalent of adding a new features that required multiple changes across many files and probably the introduction whole new components and those changes need to be done to work together to achieve the overall goal.\\n\\nMany thx\\n\\nEDIT Thanks for all the responses so far, I have only had time to skim through them so far.

Right? And probably something similar, if weaker, applies to all the various crazy proteins and other stuff that makes a cell work. Like, look at how conserved photopigments are across the animal kingdom (even beyond, you can find photopigments in non-animals that might be evolutionarily related to the opsins in human and fly retinas, etc etc).\\n\\nThen you can get up to bigger scales, to things like cell types. Like, will there ever be a descendant of animals that has no neurons? It seems like, since neurons first evolved, they are *stuck*. I read a paper a while back on similarities between invertebrate and vertebrate neurons, and was amazed. They even use more-or-less the same neurotransmitters (if in different roles).\\n\\nThen bigger: since insects invented wings, virtually none of them have lost them (ants, sort of - and a few other very weird examples). And insects always have that exoskeleton and always will - no insect will ever evolve with an endoskeleton, right?\\n\\nAnd how tetrapods all have this 1-arm-bone then 2-arm-bone then lots-of-bones plan for their arms and legs (since they all started as fins-on-pegs). It seems like that just will never go away (though you might lose your arms and legs, like a snake, if you have them they always follow that plan).\\n\\nWhat do we call this phenomenon?&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;How to think about conservation or permanence in evolution?&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/vc7j1t/how_to_think_about_conservation_or_permanence_in/&quot;,&quot;vote_ratio&quot;:0.7},&quot;vc7lpd&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:&quot;solipsistrealist&quot;,&quot;comment_count&quot;:391,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;vc7lpd&quot;,&quot;post_time&quot;:1655224658.0,&quot;score&quot;:3478,&quot;subreddit&quot;:&quot;askscience&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Has the amount of COVID deaths caused the global population to decline when combined with other deaths from other causes?&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/vc7lpd/has_the_amount_of_covid_deaths_caused_the_global/&quot;,&quot;vote_ratio&quot;:0.88},&quot;vca4fv&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Surrender_monkey21&quot;,&quot;comment_count&quot;:14,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;vca4fv&quot;,&quot;post_time&quot;:1655231399.0,&quot;score&quot;:78,&quot;subreddit&quot;:&quot;askscience&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Do gravitational waves move at different speeds through different media like electromagnetic radiation?&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/vca4fv/do_gravitational_waves_move_at_different_speeds/&quot;,&quot;vote_ratio&quot;:0.91},&quot;vcg57z&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:&quot;LAMBKING&quot;,&quot;comment_count&quot;:11,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;vcg57z&quot;,&quot;post_time&quot;:1655248217.0,&quot;score&quot;:10,&quot;subreddit&quot;:&quot;askscience&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;I need to settle a debate with someone.

The state of affairs at this stage is a foreign protein inside the cell and it needs to end up in the \\&quot;hands off the immune system\\&quot;. If the protein in question is say the so-called \\&quot;spike protein\\&quot; of COVID-19, how does it get outside of the cell or to the surface of the cell? \\n\\nCells are complicated^citation ^needed and usually have many interconnected parts like proteins helping other proteins get where they need to go or to fold in a particular way. Does the inherent shape/structure of the spike protein in this case make it thermodynamically favorable to embed itself in the cell\'s membrane and express itself outward? Proteins don\'t generally just leak out of cells so my current best guess is that it\'s presented by the cell in some way. Assuming this is the case, does that immune system now recognize that cell as foreign and destroy it (and thus \'read\' the spike protein)?\\n\\nThanks for anyone\'s time.&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;How do proteins made by mRNA vaccines get to where they need to go?&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/vgmvvf/how_do_proteins_made_by_mrna_vaccines_get_to/&quot;,&quot;vote_ratio&quot;:0.66},&quot;vgou4d&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Tales_of_Ba_Sing_Se&quot;,&quot;comment_count&quot;:12,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;vgou4d&quot;,&quot;post_time&quot;:1655740855.0,&quot;score&quot;:18,&quot;subreddit&quot;:&quot;askscience&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Why is having high blood pressure bad for you?&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/vgou4d/why_is_having_high_blood_pressure_bad_for_you/&quot;,&quot;vote_ratio&quot;:0.79},&quot;vgp9e6&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Complex-Opening-9638&quot;,&quot;comment_count&quot;:3,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;vgp9e6&quot;,&quot;post_time&quot;:1655741947.0,&quot;score&quot;:4,&quot;subreddit&quot;:&quot;askscience&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;When I always search for answers the internet just tells me that is done by a blood sample and using a needle.\\n\\nWhat I\'m looking for is the scientific procedure, what is used, a microscope, some type of machine, a mathematical formula... ?\\n\\nHow do you go from having the blood to having a particular number and result on a paper.\\n\\nAnd as well I would appreciate if somebody told me how to search for this type of more specific I formation on the future, what should I type on the Google bar search to find this information.\\n\\nKind regards.&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;How is AN SHBG test done?&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/vgp9e6/how_is_an_shbg_test_done/&quot;,&quot;vote_ratio&quot;:0.75},&quot;vgpjbc&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Quinfluenza&quot;,&quot;comment_count&quot;:344,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;vgpjbc&quot;,&quot;post_time&quot;:1655742658.0,&quot;score&quot;:5817,&quot;subreddit&quot;:&quot;askscience&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;How big dogs have much shorter lifespans than smaller dogs, is it the same for humans?

Most of the people I\'d seen refuting it where simply saying that lemon juice can\'t turn your body alkaline and that it\'s pseudoscience hogwash, rather than specifically talking to the point that it does or doesn\'t make alkaline byproducts during digestion.\\n\\nSo my question is: Does lemon juice produce alkaline byproducts during digestion and make your urine more alkaline, and if it does, what\'s the process that occurs to make this happen and what is happening to all the acid? Where are the extra Hydrogen ions going?\\n\\nEDIT: Thanks for all the replies! Got some really good ones that answered my question with academic sources! Just wanted to note that as I mentioned, I know that your body regulates pH and that trying to turn your body or urine \\&quot;more alkaline\\&quot; doesn\'t have any health benefits, was just curious on this specific point of urine/alkaline byproducts because I couldn\'t find an explanation but saw relatively reputable sources suggest it\'s true.\\n\\nStill, always good to include that as part of the explanation for others who may not know that it gives no health benefits.&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;How does lemon juice turn your urine alkaline?&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/vje6n1/how_does_lemon_juice_turn_your_urine_alkaline/&quot;,&quot;vote_ratio&quot;:0.91},&quot;vje8tr&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:&quot;crimsonengine&quot;,&quot;comment_count&quot;:18,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;vje8tr&quot;,&quot;post_time&quot;:1656039568.0,&quot;score&quot;:363,&quot;subreddit&quot;:&quot;askscience&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;I\'m predicting 60 events to happen over 30 days, randomly distributed.

Conversely we know that abused dogs will exhibit fear of humans, of men, or of particular objects because of negative experiences associated with these things, but are the dogs remembering specific times that they were hurt by these things, or is it again just a learned instinct?\\n\\nWhen we as humans recall a memory, we are to all intents and purposes experiencing a dulled down abbreviated version of the original sensory inputs that created it (although obviously the sensory neurons from the body aren\'t involved this time). We know that it\'s only a memory, but I\'m wondering whether an animal would be able to make this distinction. Perhaps the horses in my introduction would become really confused as to why they were eating grass but at the same time being ridden around, hearing a crowd but at the same time not seeing one, then suddenly seeing a crowd but not hearing any noise, then chewing on grass again but at the same time feeling a bit in their mouths. Do animals possess the intelligence to distinguish memories from live experiences, or is this a reason why they can\'t possess episodic memory, because it would mess with their heads too much?&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Do animals have episodic memory?&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/vlvrxt/do_animals_have_episodic_memory/&quot;,&quot;vote_ratio&quot;:0.9},&quot;vlw4yx&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:&quot;navpirx&quot;,&quot;comment_count&quot;:417,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;vlw4yx&quot;,&quot;post_time&quot;:1656338313.0,&quot;score&quot;:3440,&quot;subreddit&quot;:&quot;askscience&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Do viruses have any beneficial function at all for the ecosystem?&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/vlw4yx/do_viruses_have_any_beneficial_function_at_all/&quot;,&quot;vote_ratio&quot;:0.95},&quot;vlyx4q&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Nemarus&quot;,&quot;comment_count&quot;:5,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;vlyx4q&quot;,&quot;post_time&quot;:1656345818.0,&quot;score&quot;:9,&quot;subreddit&quot;:&quot;askscience&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;When we see a distant star or galaxy, we are seeing light that is coming toward us from a luminous source.\\n\\nWhen we see a planet, we are seeing light reflected back at us after scattering on the planet\'s surface.\\n\\nBut I\'ve never understood how we \'see\' the CMB.

I understand the concepts of diffusion and perfusion-limited gases, but there is one point in my physiology textbook which I cannot seem to understand.\\n\\nWhen discussing DLCO, the textbook states that CO is a diffusion-limited gas. It then goes on to discuss the effects of changes in flow (Q) on DLCO and how doubling or halving flow does not impact DLCO, supporting that it is a diffusion not perfusion-limited gas. But I do not get why changing Q would not affect DLCO. Here is my take on it: Arterial CO pressure does not equilibrate with alveolar CO pressure by the end of the pulmonary capillary (i.e., diffusion-limited), but it still does rise slightly to some value lower than that of the alveoli. So wouldn\\u2019t increasing flow decrease contact time and thus cause an even lower arterial CO pressure throughout the pulmonary capillary and thus the gradient for CO diffusion would be greater than at lower flow rates? And therefore, a higher DLCO?\\n\\nIn support of my understanding, increased DLCO can be observed in obesity and is attributed to increased pulmonary blood flow in these patients.\\n\\nNoteworthy to mention, the textbook does assume that pulmonary capillary dimensions are constant with changing flow.

I started thinking about crossover and I have a lot of questions that I can\'t really find the answer to. It seems like most places just touch on crossover as a step during meiosis, but don\'t really elaborate much. Anyway, here are my questions I hope someone can help me wrap my head around this:\\n\\n* First of all: does crossover only happen (at most) once per chromosome? All diagrams look somewhat like [this](https://ib.bioninja.com.au/_Media/crossing-over_med.jpeg), which indicate that they swap only the ends. Is that the case, or are those diagrams an oversimplification and more than one \\&quot;pieces\\&quot; that are crossed over?\\n\\n* If the answer to the above is yes, then I want to move onto this [meiosis diagram](https://cdn.lecturio.com/assets/Overview-of-meiosis-I-and-II-1200x1034.png). Is it true to assume then that we all likely possess entire chromosomes that came directly from our grandparents? In the diagram, each of the 4 cells has 2 chromosomes, one that\'s intact, and one that\'s crossed over. So for example, if my dad passed an \\&quot;intact\\&quot; chromosome 1 to me, there\'s a 1/4 chance that I\'ll pass that intact chromosome 1 to my son. Is that correct?\\n\\n* How does crossing over work with the sex chromosomes? In the case of eggs, there\'s always two Xs, do those crossover? In the case of sperm, there\'s one X and one Y, do those crossover in anyway, or are they left alone?\\n\\n* If the answer to question 1 is yes, then is there a pre-determined (approximate or accurate) length that\'s exchanged? If so, how is it determined? If it\'s random, what determines it? \\n\\n* Is the number of base pairs in an exchange the same on each side? Also, this question and the above assume it\'s done by number of base pairs. Is it \\&quot;calculated\\&quot; differently perhaps? Number of genes? Something else?\\n\\n* Now, the question in the title: how does the process ensure that no really bad errors are introduced? If I understand correctly, it\'s not necessary that the two homologous chromosomes are the same length. One may have mutations the other doesn\'t, and vice versa. It\'s also likely those mutations are fine independently. But when mixed together, they could break things... so why doesn\'t it?\\n\\n* And lastly: if question 1 is yes, has the existence of the crossover process lead to \\&quot;less important\\&quot; (or \\&quot;more ok to mutate) genes to be at the tips, and \\&quot;more important\\&quot; genes to be towards the middle? For example, per the question above, I imagine that eye color genes or genes that contribute to my face shape or skin color or traits like that are more \\&quot;ok\\&quot; to be mutated, where as for example, the gene for hemoglobin... you don\'t want to mess with that one.\\n\\n\\nThanks for looking at my wall of text. I\'m happy to restate questions if they don\'t make sense. Hope someone or many of you can help me with this.\\n\\nThanks again!&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;How do cells ensure crossover during meiosis doesn\'t result in fatal mistakes?&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/vpz14y/how_do_cells_ensure_crossover_during_meiosis/&quot;,&quot;vote_ratio&quot;:0.78},&quot;vpz83q&quot;:{&quot;author&quot;:&quot;dynastylobster&quot;,&quot;comment_count&quot;:6,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;vpz83q&quot;,&quot;post_time&quot;:1656790210.0,&quot;score&quot;:10,&quot;subreddit&quot;:&quot;askscience&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;the solar system (along with other stars) were created by a cloud of gas and dust formed by the nova of a previous star. is there anything we can learn or find out about what that \\&quot;parent\\&quot; star system was like? like.. theres gotta be some kind of evidence.

And every field, before quantisation, is a vector space on which there must be representations of the Poincaire group defined as operators.\\n\\nFor instance, the operator e^(xd/dy-y/d/dx) is a representation of a member belonging to this group, and this operator acts on the vector space of fields, causing to rotate them. e^(d/dx) is another member of this group. Another member would be the exponentiation of Pauli matrices. Those don\'t operate on infinite dimensional fields, but rather on 2- component objects. Another member of this group could be 4x4 Lorentz transformations, which operate on 4 vectors. Bottom line : **every field that we quantise must have operators of this group defined on them.**\\n\\nAbout SU1xSU2xSU3, I know that these are used as gauge groups.

When we look at stars with our eyes, they look more red than they actually are. When a picture is taken, the star looks more red than it actually is. This leads to two ways to represent a star in a picture (like [this one](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NXmL6bbh7QMA3xxfuu56uZ.png)):\\n\\n1. The way a star looks for a human on earth (non-colour corrected for redshift)\\n2. The way a star *actually* looks (colour corrected for redshift). It would display the colour of a star like the star actually sends out.\\n\\nAnd so rises my question: are pictures of stars colour-corrected for redshift? Do the pictures display a star like a human would see it, or how it looks in reality (as if you were right next to it)?\\n\\nFor example, in the picture linked above, the star at the centre is just a white spot. But let\'s take the orange star to the left bottom of the middle. Is it actually that red (colour-corrected)? Or does it look that red because of red shift (not colour-corrected)?\\n\\nIn school, in dutch, I learned the term \\&quot;Emission spectrum\\&quot; of a star (almost always hydrogen is used). I think the official english term is RVS? You can use that and the default (\\&quot;recorded\\&quot; on earth) to calculate the amount of redshift. If you know how much redshift there is, you can colour-correct a picture for redshift. So if you supply a picture of a star and it\'s RVS, you can do some calculations and color-correct a picture. However, when searching the web, I didn\'t find a single \\&quot;tool\\&quot; that could do this. Why isn\'t there any?\\n\\nI just had this topic in physics class at school and I came up with these questions after his lesson and my teacher didn\'t know the answer, so here I am, asking it to you people.

So I just began studying the immune system and I have some questions. \\nSo if I understand it correctly so far, when pathogens enter the body they have to get recognized somehow, so the body can destroy them. So pathogens have these pamp (pathogen associated molecular patterns) that get recognized by the phagocytes with the help of \\&quot;toll like receptors\\&quot;. Also my textbook says something about opsonins, chemical compounds that \\&quot; mark\\&quot; the pathogens so phagocytes can recognize and destroy them. \\n\\nMy questions are:\\n1) How did the cell evolve those toll receptors? Was it randomly but they stayed bc they are useful? Let\'s say you have a cell that no pathogen has ever interacted with it. So logically, the cell hasn\'t any receptor for it (or it has but it was a random generation-im not sure how it works). \\n2) From my understanding, opsonins bind to the pathogen somehow and help the phagocyte recognize it. So opsonins have a lock-key relationship with phagocytes? It would make sense for the cell to recognize molecules that are part of the cell. But how do opsonins bind to the pathogens? My textbook isn\'t going on detail. \\n\\nThank you for reading so far and sorry if my questions are stupid.

Some vaccines use only parts of a virus (or bacteria). And in the case of the Covid vaccines, they use mRNA technology. \\n\\nNow, the way I understand it, once this is introduced into the body, the immune system reacts and neutralizes the antigen. So, when the antigen enters the body a second time, the immune system reacts much quicker. I also understand that microbes can mutate, which has an effect on the vaccine\'s potency. This is why we have to get a flu shot every year, because the virus mutates. \\n\\nHowever, in the cases of Smallpox and Polio, we have managed to eradicate these diseases by way of vaccines.

Ultimately this culminates in the correspondence between Anti-de Sitter spaces (a model of the universe under general relativity) and conformal field theories (i.e., quantum field theories). In the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klpDHn8viX8), the presenter tells us two things: 1.) That this correspondence leads to a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; theory of quantum gravity, and 2.) that interactions (between quantum particles?) on the boundary of the mathematical object\'s surface correspond to the emergence of gravity within the volume. However, he tells us that this isn\'t applicable to *our* universe, because anti-de Sitter spaces assume a negative curvature on the space-time metric, while as far as I understand, in reality it is zero (i.e., a Minkowski space-time).\\n\\nSo my questions are twofold: what quantum information is the problem here, and in need of conservation; are they things like spins and energies, and why does this lead to the holographic principle?

Reaction expected to produce precipitates of metallic copper and tin and a solution of iron(ii) sulfate.\\n\\nQuestion: Would the copper and tin precipitate out as a metallic alloy, or would they come out as separate layers, crystals, etc.. ?\\n\\nSo... I\'ve been messing around with copper(ii) sulfate for the past few days. One of my ongoing experiments started with putting scrap electronics solder in a solution of the stuff. My idea was the tin and lead would replace the copper and leave a solution of pure tin(ii) sulfate and insoluble lead(ii) sulfate and copper metal. The results were promising as I was left with a beautiful turquoise blue solution along with white precipitate of lead(ii) sulfate and copper collecting on the old solder. My only mistake was that I did not have enough solder, and so the resulting solution was still mostly copper(ii) sulfate.\\n\\nIt was this mixture of tin(ii) sulfate and copper(ii) sulfate that I added a slightly rusted steel hammer head to. I honestly didn\'t have a plan at this point other then a quick google search to see where iron was in terms of reactivity. Success on that: I now have an almost pure solution of iron(ii) sulfate. I will likely continue using sulfate to juggle metal ions with reckless abandon.\\n\\nIt\'s the hammer head I sacrificed that I\'m really curios about. It\'s completely covered in copper crystals and I\'m pretty certain the tin is mixed in as well. I\'ll link a picture in the comments.
