			<p>BRIDGES(Bridging Real-world Infrastructure Designed to Goal-align,
			Engage, and Stimulate), an NSF TUES project, is focused on two primary goals,
			(1)  providing <it>easy-to-use interfaces</it> to exciting,
			engaging real-world data
			(social networks, scientific data, etc), to make it possible for their use in
			freshmen/sophomore  level CS courses, and (2) make it easier to <i> visualize
			the data structures that students create as part of their assignments </i>
			in algorithms and data structures courses. BRIDGES is carefully designed
			to augment the student experience in routine introductory courses
			in Computer Science. <p>

			The BRIDGES toolkit provides a set of
			classes(C++ and Java are supported) that serve as building blocks to the
			common CS data structures, including lists (arrays, linked lists),
			tree structures (general trees, binary trees, binary search trees,
			AVL trees), graphs (adjacency list and adjacency matrix representations)
			used in freshmen/sophomore level computer science. BRIDGES handles the
			complex data and web interfaces, thereby letting students focus on the core
			course materials, while providing a more engaging means to view their
			output on the web (that can be shared)
			</p>
			Examples of  BRIDGES projects can be seen on the right panel.<p>

			<h3><u>BRIDGES Status</u></h3>
			<p>Current version of BRIDGES is 2.3.3 (Released June 1, 2018).<br>
			<i>Version 2.3.3 includes additional datasets interfaced to 
			   BRIDGES (a dataset and BRIDGES API for Songs), a 2D Grid type
				that can be used for image related applications, numerous 
				bug fixes and improvements to the base classes. 
				See <a href="http://bridgesuncc.github.io/bridges_doclinks.html"></a></i> on latest changes to BRIDGES and its history of earlier changes.
				for more information. <p>
			<h3><u>Looking for New BRIDGES Users</u></h3>
			<i><b>We are currently looking for 3-4 additional external users 
			to adopt BRIDGES in
			their data structures/algorithms courses and provide feedback. 
			Stipends are available for instructors who would like to partner with our team and collect student feedback as part of the BRIDGES evaluation.</b></i>
			</p>
			<h3><u>BRIDGES News</u></h3>
			  <font size = +0.75> <i>We have just released BRIDGES version 2.4.1 (Jan, 2019, in C++, Java and 
				Python), which (in addition to numerous fixes/enhancements) adds 
				a ColorGrid data type (see example visualization on the right), 
				support for Spatial data Structures (Kd Tree), a shape collection 
				structure, and a Song Lyrics dataset. In the works are extensions to 
				using BRIDGES to build simple games (demo at SIGCSE 2019).</i><p>
			<h3>  BRIDGES Workshop - Feb. 27, 2019, SIGCSE 2019, Minneapolis, MN.</h3>
				<font size = +0.75> <i> We will be conducting a BRIDGES workshop at 
				ACM SIGCSE 2019, on Wednesday
				Feb. 27, 7-10pm (Hyatt Greenway E (2nd Floor). Please see
				<a href="https://whova.com/embedded/subsession/sigcs_201902/486899/497255/"> this link </a> for more information. </i> </font>
			<h3> BRIDGES Workshop - June 6, 2018, Temple University, Philadelphia</h3>
				<font size = +0.75><i>We plan to conduct a 1 day BRIDGES workshop on June 6, 2018,
				at Temple University. We encourage instructors to take advantage
				of this workshop if you are interested in using BRIDGES in your
				Data Structures/Algorithms courses. Limited travel support is
				available (can cover regional attendees). For more information
				see the following links for the
