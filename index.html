			<p>BRIDGES(Bridging Real-world Infrastructure Designed to Goal-align,
			Engage, and Stimulate), an NSF TUES project, is focused on two primary goals,
			  <ol>
			    <li>  providing <strong>easy-to-use interfaces to exciting,
			engaging real-world data</strong>
			(social networks, scientific data, etc), to make it possible for their use in
			      freshmen/sophomore  level CS courses, </li>
			    <li>make it <strong>easy to visualize
			course assignments</strong> 
			      in a CS1, CS2, data structures, or algorithm courses</li>
			  </ol>
			  BRIDGES is carefully designed
			to augment the student experience in routine introductory courses
			in Computer Science. </p>

			<p>The BRIDGES toolkit provides a set of
			classes(C++ and Java are supported) that serve as building blocks to the
			common CS data structures, including lists (arrays, linked lists),
			tree structures (general trees, binary trees, binary search trees,
			AVL trees), graphs (adjacency list and adjacency matrix representations)
			used in freshmen/sophomore level computer science. BRIDGES handles the
			complex data and web interfaces, thereby letting students focus on the core
			course materials, while providing a more engaging means to view their
			output on the web (that can be shared)
			</p>


			<h2>BRIDGES Status</h2>
			<p>We are releasing BRIDGES version 3.0.0 on August 15, 2019.</p>
		  <p>Version 3.0.0 includes
		    <ul>
		      <li>additional datasets such as Map through Open Street Map, and Actor-Movie data through Wikidata</li>
		      <li>additional data structure such as Large Graphs, and Spatial Trees</li>
		      <li>support for simple games</li>
		      <li>support for line charts, including timing experiments</li>
		      <li>numerous bug fixes and improvements to the base classes. </li>
		    </ul>
				See the <a href="http://bridgesuncc.github.io/bridges_doclinks.html">changelog</a> on latest changes to BRIDGES and its history of earlier changes.
			 </p>
		    
			<h2>Looking for New BRIDGES Users</h2>
			<p>We are currently looking for 3-4 additional external users 
			to adopt BRIDGES in
			their data structures/algorithms courses and provide feedback. 
			<strong>Stipends are available for instructors</strong> who would like to partner with our team and collect student feedback as part of the BRIDGES evaluation.</p>
			<h2>Looking for New BRIDGES Developpers</h2>
		  <p>We are currently looking for students to help with Bridges.
		    We are recruiting both Undergraduate students and PhD student.</p>
		  <p>The students will need to be enrolled at UNC Charlotte, or at Temple Universities. Stipends are available for students working on Bridges.</p>
		  <p><a href="mailto:iuse-bridges-group@uncc.edu?Subject=Bridges%20Query">Contact Us!</a> for more information.</p>

			    <li> A binary search tree built using earthquake magnitudes;
				data from the USGIS earthquake feed (periodically retrieved and stored on
				server, so as to always access the most recent quakes).
				<a href="http://bridges-cs.herokuapp.com/assignments/1001/bridges_public"><img src="./img/tree.png" alt="" /></a></li>

			    <li>Graph of earthquake data, clustered by
			      magnitude and colorcoded by quake magnitude.

			    <li>Graph of IMDB actor/movie data, clustered by
					genre and colorcoded by movie ratings.

			    <li>2D grid structure  example that can form the basis for 
			    a variety of image processing operations.
