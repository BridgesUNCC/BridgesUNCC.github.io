	  <p>In our design the student use our client on their personal computer. This 
	    client program is run via a gradle build script which allows it to be integrated 
	    into any IDE. We chose to do this because we may have students who are using 
	    Eclipse, JGrasp or Netbeans. This client can connect to the server via an API 
	    key or log in credentials. <p>
	    
	    The server provides three main functions; a crawler which gets data from 
	    data-sources, an API which provides access to data from the client, and a website 
	    where students can view their visualizations, change their log in credentials, or 
	    validate their account with data-sources. Each time the client makes a request for 
	    data from a data-source we determine whether they have provided us with the 
	    authentication to access the data-source. If they have provided authorized access, 
	    we make a request on their behalf; otherwise, we make a request using our public 
	    account. The public account will only be able to fetch from certain providers 
	    because we have a limit to the amount of requests we can make with the public 
	    account. All requests are cached to prevent request throttling by the 
	    data-source's API. After receiving data, students will be required to manipulate 
	    this data and then make a post request with this data to the server via the API. 
	    These posts will store their submission in a database and generate a link to a 
	    webpage, where the data in the database will be visualized using D3.
