    <h2>BRIDGES Java with Eclipse IDE</h2>
	<i> <b>Note. The following set up instructions used Eclipse Version 2022-12 runningng  JRE 17 on OSX; BRIDGES requires the use of Java 8 or higher</i></b> <br> <p>

	  <b>Step 1: Install Eclipse </b>
	  <ul> <li> If you do not have Eclipse 
	      installed, download it from the 
	      <a href = "http://www.eclipse.org/downloads"> Eclipse site</a> 
	      and install it on your computer .
	  </ul>
	</tr>
	<tr> 
	  <b>Step 2: Create Bridges Account</b> 
	  <ul> <li> Visit the Bridges 
	      <a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io"> 
		main page</a> and create yourself an account 
	      by clicking the login button
	      on the top navigation bar. <b>Please ensure that 
		your user id is devoid of spaces (good idea to use your school
		email id), as it will be 
		used as part of the web link for your projects.</b>
	      After creating your account, click on your profile 
	      name in the upper right corner to view your 
	      profile. Once in your profile, you will see your
	      API Key; you will need this API key in part 2 
	      of the tutorial(as well as in every BRIDGES program 
	      you write). <b>NOTE:</b> Make sure to remember 
	      your password. There is no password recovery option, 
	      and you can only have one account per email address.

		your project in the Package Explorer window in Eclipse.  
	      <li> If you have  got a Project in the Eclipse Package 
		Explorer with your username as the project name, and the
