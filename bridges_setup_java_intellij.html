	    <b>Step 1: Install IntelliJ IDE</b>
	    <ul> 
	      <li> If you do not have IntelliJ 
		installed, download it from the 
		<a href = "https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/"> 
		  IntelliJ IDEA site</a> and install it on your computer. 
	      <li> IntelliJ comes with  Java JDK 1.8, or you can configure it
		to point to your Java installation.
	      <li> Open IntelliJ application after installation

	    <b>Step 2: Create Bridges Account</b> 
	    <ul> <li>  Visit the Bridges 
		<a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io"> main page</a> 
		and create an account by clicking the 
		login button on the top navigation bar. Click "Sign Up!" near the bottom of the new window. 
		<li>Please ensure that 
                your user id is devoid of spaces, as it will be 
                used as part of the web link for your projects.
		<li>After creating your account, click 
		on the profile tab in the uppper-right corner. In this window, you will see your account details and
		API Key; you will need this API key later in the tutorial (as well as in every BRIDGES program 
		you write).
		<li><b>NOTE:</b> Make sure to remember 
		your password. There is no password recovery option, 
		and you can only have one account per email address.

		<i>Open  Module Settings</i>. Select <i>Modules</i> which will
		show all the modules/Jars currently loaded.
	      <li> Open the dependencies tab near the top of the page. Then, click on the <i>+</i> icon.
		  <li> <i>Jars or Directories</i>
		  <li> This will open your systems file explorer. Navigate to the Bridges Jar file you downloaded earlier and click open.

		project. Hit Ok to get rid of the window.

            the main java file. Make sure the file and class name match!
        <li> Initialize the bridges object with an assignment number (it can be any num), and your user ID and API key 
			you generated at the start of the tutorial. 
        <li> Run the program by hitting the <b> Run button (Triangle icon) </b> in the upper-right corner.
        <li> You will see a link printed on the console. Use that to visualize the
            output as seen in the image.
