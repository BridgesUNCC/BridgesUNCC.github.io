			<a href = "http://repl.it">Repl.it site</a> and create an account for

	<b>Step 2: Create Bridges Account</b> 
	 	Visit the Bridges 
	 	<a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io"> main page</a> 
	    	and create yourself an account by clicking the login button
	    	on the top navigation bar.  Please ensure that 
            your user id is devoid of spaces, as it will be 
            used as part of the web link for your projects.
	    	After creating your account, click 
	    	on your profile name in the upper right corner to 
	    	view your profile. Once in your profile, you will see your
	    	API Key; <b>you will need this API key later
	    	in the tutorial(as well as in every BRIDGES program 
	    	you write). NOTE: Make sure to remember 
	    	your password</b>.

	<b>Step 3: Get Installation script to install Bridges Java files, Makefile</b> 
	<ul> 
		<li> The install includes getting the Java BRIDGES Jar file 
			and an example Makefile. 
		<li> To simplify the install, you will set up BRIDGES by running
			a bash shell script. The script is 
			<a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io/sw/replit-java-setup.sh">
			here </a>. Save this file in a convenient place. <b> As Repl.it makes it 
			difficult to access a persistent or shared folders, <b>this script must be run
			for each repl (or project, you create) once</b>.
	</ul>
	</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td class = "col-md-2"> <b>Step 3: Create a Repl Project</b> 
		<ul> 
			<li> Log into Repl.it and create a New repl project, by clicking on 
				<b>New repl</b> button on top left
			<li>  Follow the menus to create a Java project
			<li> You will see a new project like what is shown on the right, with the 
					the files on the left panel and the bash shell console on the right.
			<li> You should be able to click the green Run (or Play) button at the top to 
				run the 'Hello World' program.

	<tr>
	<td class = "col-md-2"> 
	<b>Step 4: Run the bash script, install BRIDGES and Curl</b>
	<ul> 
		<li> Bring the installation script you downloaded into the Repl; you can use
			drag and drop from your file browser, or use the Upload Files button that
			you get by hitting the 3 vertical dots on the Files bar(top left). You will
			see the script file added to your list of files.
		<li> On the console, run the script by typing <p><br>
				<i>sh replit-java-setup.sh path-to-repl-project</i>  <p> <br>
		<li> In the above command, the 'path-to-repl-project' should be replaced by the 
			path to your project. For instance if you created a JavaTest repl, then 
			you would use <p><br>
				<i>sh replit-java-setup.sh ${HOME}/JavaTest</i>  <p> <br>
		<li> This will take about a few seconds to complete 
		<li> <strong> Validation:</strong> You should see a 'lib' folder containing the
			the Bridges jar file. You will also see
			a Makefile, that will be useful for compiling and building the Java program.

	<b>Step 5: Compile and run an example BRIDGES program </b>
	<ul> 
		<li> Go to the <a href="http://bridgesuncc.github.io/tutorials/Overview.html">
			tutorials pages</a> and pick a BRIDGES tutorial. Select  the singly linked
			list tutorial (under Lists) and pick the first one (be sure to hit the 
			Jave tab to get the Java version!).
		<li> Copy/Paste that program into a file called sllist.java on your replit file
			browser (you can remove Main.java).
		<li> You should see something like the figure on the right.
		<li> Add your BRIDGES credentials on the first line of the program: assignment
			number can be any positive number, user id and api key are from your 
			BRIDGES account (when you login to BRIDGES, the profile button will display
			the credentials).
        <li> Modify the classname to match the file name
		<li> Click on the Makefile
		<li> The SRCS line should be modified to point to your source file: sllist.java. 
			If you have multiple files, then these would be listed in sequence.
		<li> The EXE file should be modified to sllist (or the executable name you choose).
		<li> Compile and execute thlde program. You can type 'make' on the console or 
			hit the 'Run' button  to compile the program.

	<td class = "col-md-2"> <b>Step 8: Visualize</b>
	<ul>
		<li> Executing the program will print a web link on the console. Click on the 
			link to see the visualization. You will see a linked list on the console. 
			Hit the 'l' button to turn on the labels. You can pan and zoom into 
			the visualization with your mouse.

	<td class = "col-md-2"> <b>Final Notes</b>
	<ul>
		<li> Note that the bash script is run once at the beginning for each repl that is
			created.
		<li> The changes to the Makefile are also made once, unless new source files are
			added, in which case the SRCS variable needs to be updated.
