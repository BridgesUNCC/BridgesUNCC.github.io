<i> Are you looking for ways to spice up your CS1, CS2, Data Structures, or Algorithm 
Analysis course? Come to our BRIDGES training workshops at UNC Charlotte this summer! 
BRIDGES provides a toolkit  that lets you easily bring in interesting and engaging 
real-world data into your course assignments, and allows your students to build 
simple games, create data structure  visualizations, and assess algorithm performance.  BRIDGES can show the relevance of computing in these early foundational courses by connecting
it with real-world problems and scenarios. See the following image and links to more detailed
information on BRIDGES and examples</i> <p> <p>

We will conduct 2 BRIDGES Training Workshops during the Summer of 2022. The 3 day
workshop will enable participants to learn about current practices in course
design, assessment of their current course, and enable revising their course to 
integrate  BRIDGES into their curriculum.  At the end of the workshop, the revised
course is expected to ready for delivery in the Fall semester.
