Do you ever wonder how your course compares to courses taught by your peers or
other instructors? Do you want to know whether you are giving your 
students a good coverage of what they should know? Do you want to find 
better materials to use in your 
course? Do you wonder how to distribute that great assignment you have 
designed across the country? The CS Materials is a system that can help 
you answer these questions. This 3-day  workshop will train you on on how to 
enter the materials of your class into the system, perform relevant 
material, coverage, and alignment analyses on your course and compare it
to similar courses in the system. Come to the workshop with 
all the materials from one of your classes that are ready to be shared. 
You will get a much deeper understanding of your course and how it
stacks up against current national curriculum guidelines.

The following figures illustrate some of the capabilities of the CS Materials 
System; the radial visualization represents the ACM 2013 Curriculum 
guidelines' tree structure, with the root at the center, followed by 
Knowledge Areas (Level 1), Topics (level 2), Learning Outcomes (level 3).

We will conduct 2 CS Materials  Training Workshops during the Summer of 2022. 
The 3 day workshop will enable participants to learn about current practices 
in course design, facilitate inputting their course into the CS Materials
system, assess and analyse of their course, enable revisions 
to their course structure and content, study alignment between different 
course components, compare their course to similar courses, and possibly 
add more engaging materials. At the end of the workshop, 
participants will have a much better understanding of their course, with a  
revised version ready for delivery in Fall 22/Spring 23. 

<h3> Dates</h3>
<ul>
<li> Workshop 1: <b>June 6-8, 2022 </b>
