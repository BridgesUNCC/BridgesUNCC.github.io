\subsection{What makes a course engaging?}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Engagement and Motivation}
\begin{itemize} 
	\item Well understood that student engagement is an important
		predictor of student acthievement.
	\item Engagement can span many dimensions\footnote{Handelsman et al., 
	A Measure of College Student Course Engagment, Journal of Educ. Res., 2005}: 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item skills engagement
			\item participation/interaction engagement
			\item emotional engagement
			\item performance engagement
		\end{itemize}
	\item Engagement and motivation are closely tied to each other
	\item How do we motivate and engage students? 
		Many models have been proposed, such as 
		the MUSIC model of motivation  (Jones, 2009)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Engaging Students: Experiences from an OOP Course
\footnote{Subramanian et al., Influence of Course Design on Student Engagement and Motivation in an Online Course, ACM SIGCSE 2020}}
\begin{block}{Two semesters of a project based OOP course, using
student  reflections after each course module}
\end{block}
\begin{itemize} 
	\item e\textbf{M}powerment: Project choice, freedom to be creative, 
		experimentation and tinkering
	\item \textbf{U}sefulness: Working with real-world data/tools, team
		environment
	\item \textbf{S}uccess: Assignments with clear instructions, predictability,
			reflect on personal successes/failures, feedback
	\item \textbf{I}nterest: Fun factor,  games, real world images used
		as part of course
	\item \textbf{C}aring: Sensitive to student needs, prompt feedback, deadline
		flexibility
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Engagement Using BRIDGES: Visual and Interactive}
\begin{itemize}
	\item BRIDGES uses visualizations of data structures, algorithm outputs
		as a mechanism for engaging students.
	\item Visualizations of classic CS concepts can be helpful in making
		them real and more meaningful. 
	\item Student feedback is very positive, appreciating the features
		of BRIDGES that enables them to see what they produce.

%\begin{block}{What are your thoughts on engaging students as part of course activities?}
%\end{block}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item  How do you engage your students? 
%\item  What tools/techniques have you used in the past to motivate s
%		tudents?
%\item Is there something you havent tried and would like to try?
%\end{itemize}
%\end{frame}

\subsection{Making it interactive/visual}

\begin{frame}{Making it Interactive/Visual}
\begin{itemize}
%       Data on this is somewhat mixed on algovis, but
%		for some 
%		problems/applications that  has spatial and/or temporal content,
%		it makes sense to view the results.
	\item Interactive applications is a more attractive approach to 
		experimentation - changing parameters to see its effect on a 
		phenomenon, solution, performance.
%  Game based applications are appreciated, but its important to tie that
%  to objectives, eg., board based games lets you practice conditionals,
%  iterations, 2D arrays
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Activity}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Review BRIDGES tutorials 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Making it real!}

\begin{frame}{Make it Real!}
\begin{itemize}
\item Using \textbf{real-world data} in course work is an important engagement tool
\item Students respond to working with data from real-world scenarios;
	appreciate the use of images, maps, games
\item Data is everywhere, the harder part is 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Accessing data in a ready-to-use form for course work
		\item Mapping the right data to course work to meet objectives.
	\end{itemize}
\item Example: A BRIDGES example for retrieving Earthquake records 
\end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Activity: BRIDGES Data Access and  Assignments that use
	real-world data and Visualizations}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Accessing Earthquake Data  
		\item Bacon Number Computation (Graph BFS)
		\item OpenStreet Map (Graphs - Shortest Path)
		\item Image Representation/Compression (Spatial Search Trees - Kd-Tree)
		\item Algorithm Benchmarking - Comparing Sorting Algorithms
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{The power of choice}
\begin{frame}{The Power of Choice}
\begin{block}{Providing choices in learning materials (lectures, 
assignments, etc.) provides flexibility and choice for students as they 
might have different preferences/interests}
\end{block}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Challenge: Designing multiple versions of  learning materials 
		that meet the same learning objectives involves a higher 
		load on instructors
	\item Examples: 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Assignments that can use different real-world datasets
			\item Different assignments that rely on the same 
					underlying algorithm
			\item Lecture slides that explain ther same concept in different 
					ways.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Choice in learning materials has shown in prior work being
		appreciated by students.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Activity}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Group 1 (Different datasets):
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Linked list using IMDB data 
			\item Linked list using USGS Earthquake data
		\end{itemize}
	\item Group 2 (Different assignments, same algorithm)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Bacon Number (Graph - BFS)
			\item Maze  Solution (2D array - BFS)
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
