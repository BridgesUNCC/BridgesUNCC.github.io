# BRIDGES WORKSHOP

## Day 1

### Introductions Workshop Objectives, Organization

-introduce us
-introduce participants
-layout workshop objective
-time and day organization

### engagement

-what is it
  -models of engagement
-why we care
-how BRIDGES can help
-Paula speaks about evaluation process

### Course design

-modern course design
-alignment
  -program/course
  -course/module
  -module/material
-CS Materials
  -ACM CS 2013
  -quick rundown
  -explanation of entering UI

### Q&A

-just Q&A

### Key in Module 1

-participants gather materials for their class 
-participants structure them in modules
  -upload them to google drive and give KR and Erik access structured in directories 
-for module 1, participants ckassify the modulein CS materials

### Key other modules

-participants enters the other module, let's go at least to module 4
-hopefully all courses classified in cs materilas at the level of modules

### Course Presentations

-participants present their course which is now structured in modules
-hard limit at 10 min per person
-maybe kr and erik have preliminary visualization

### After hours
for each participants:
  -identify some BRIDGES assignments that could be good
  -can we BRIDGESify some of their assignments
  -prep a report for their benefits


## Day 2

### What is BRIDGES?

-technical BRIDGES presentation
-API
-login
-jar files
-documentation
-tutorials

### BRIDGES Open Swim

-Start by copy/pasting a tutorial to get a feel for it
-solve a problem (any problem) in BRIDGES; probably a simple one; hopefully aligned with their course
  -CS1 maybe mountin path, maybe image blur; maybe a game if adventurous; maybe audio processing?
  -DS build IMDB graph
  -Algorithms benchmark sorting? Mountain Path?

### BRIDGES assignment repository

-what is possible in bridges
  -datasets
    -what is in there
    -static/dynamic
  -visualizations
    -what can it do
    -student level api (for instance bst provides you struct no function)
    -some example of outputs
      -shape collection as the catch all output
-What is in the repository?
  -organization
  -talk about objective/scaffolds/solution
-participants think about what makes sense to them

### plan

-participants figure out 3 assignments using BRIDGES that fit their course
-high level description: using dataset X, the student will write Y
-where does it fit in the course?
  -what topic it covers
  -what objective it covers
-can we use an existing assignment
-do we need to develop new assignment
-classify the 3 assignments in CS materials

### Make one easy case class ready
-identify which of the 3 assignments is easier to start with
-for this assignment:
  -make solution
  -make scaffold
  -make pdf description
  -make slides to introduce assignment to the class
  -make grading rubric
-Update classification done during planning to match actually built assignment  
  -does it match with/fit in the objective of the module 
-By the end of this, this assignment should be ready to use in class
-By the end, upload assignment zip file to cs materials

### report from participants

-report which assignment they'll do
  -how does it fit their class
-report what looks like it is gonna work for them
-early feedback on what they wish bridges could do

### After hours work

KR and Erik figure out analysis of classifications
for each participant:
  -coverage of modules
  -alignmetn of assignments to modules
  -other assignments developed by the group against modules
for each class (ds, cs1, cs2):  
  -coverage of all modules
  -alignments of all assignments in the modules
  -picture of each class against all classes

## Day 3

### BRIDGES assignment 2, continued word, assignment 3

All the same as in assingment 1; except the asignment may be a bit harder

-make solution; scaffold; description; classification

### What do these courses look like

-KR and Erik present the different course through CS materials
  -look for commonalities
  -look at the work accomplished during the workshop
  -are some courses simliar
  -can some assignment of one user apply to other users

### Plan work

-each participants figure out precisely what needs to happen before the beginning of the semester
-when will that be done?
-make a plan that is realistic

### Going further

-contribute in bridges
  -datasets
  -new visualizations
  -assignments
  -bug reports
  -documentation
-classify finely in CS materials
  -attend other workshop on CS materials if they wnat
  -classify directly, they already know everything in a sense
-Come to monthly meeting


### feeback/survey

-participants fill out paula's survey for NSF
-feedback on bridges
  -how can bridges be more effective in helping them
-feedback on workshop structure
  -is the structure good?
  -is there a useless piece?
   
## What do we need to do?
-make sure cloud9 works
-make/update slides
-identify a few problems to solve during openswim
-ask paula for survey links
-create two google drive folder for participant materials:
  -one public if they are ok sharing with other participants
  -one private if they are not ok sharing
