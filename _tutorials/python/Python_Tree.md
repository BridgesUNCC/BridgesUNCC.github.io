## Example Details

-   This example illustrates construction of a tree structure with a variable number of children (currently set to a maximum of 10).
-   Children are added using the addChild() method, with ordering of children from left to right and accessed by an integer index (begining at 0).
-   In the example, a small tree is built, visual attributes assigned and visualized.
