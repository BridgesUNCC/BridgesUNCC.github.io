## Example Details

-   In this example, we will build and visualize a circular doubly linked list with student information data, specified through the StudentInfo class, which will be part of the CircDLelement object through its generic variable (CircDLLelement<StudentInfo>).
-   The elements are linked, visual attributes assigned through application data and visualized.
-   Care must be taking in linking the doubly linked elements, including linking the last element to the first element of the list. See figure above for the final structure of the list.
