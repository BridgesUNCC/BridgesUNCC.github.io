## Example Details

-   The 3 examples illustrate creation of arrays of Bridges elements in 1D, 2D, 3D.
-   Indexing into the array is demonstrated, as well as setting visual attributes
-   Applications include sorting algorithms, stacks, queues (to show status of data structure operations, for instance).
