## Example Details

-   In this example, we will build and visualize a singly linked list with student information data, specified through the StudentInfo class, which will be part of the SLelement object through its generic variable (SLelement<StudentInfo>).
-   The elements are linked, visual attributes assigned through application data and visualized.

## Here's the final code:
