## Elements of a BRIDGES Program

-   **Imports:** This will usually include the BRIDGES data structure specific header files, classes related to the example, and other utility classes.
-   **BRIDGES Initialization, Credentials:** This is typically done **once** at the beginning of the application. Credentials include your user id and application authentication id (available via your BRIDGES login).
-   **Populating the Data Structure:** This involves building the data structure, as well as including application specific information (handled by generic variables that is part of each BRIDGES data structure).
-   **Adding Visual Attributes.** This is done through the ElementVisualizer (for nodes) and LinkVisualizer (for links) classes and supports attributes such size, shape, thickness, color and opacity.
-   **Specifying data structure to BRIDGES, visualization.** The calls bridges.setDataStructure() and bridges.visualize() specifies the data structure handle to BRIDGES for visualization. Multiple calls to visualize() will result in multiple visualizations (stacked one below the other). Multiple calls to setDataStructure() make sense when the the data structure is changing during an application and the user wants to visualize its state (for instance sorting application to see the state of the list after each insertion or exchange, stack pops/pushes, etc).
