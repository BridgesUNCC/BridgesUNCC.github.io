Grid<E> implements a _2D grid structure_ in BRIDGES, and it can be used to represent 2D image like structures (more efficient than the 2D array representation for large arrays), as well as implementation of simple 2D games that operate on moderate sized grids. The setDimensions() method is used to set the grid dimensions. The ColorGrid subclass specializes this class to use Color for each grid element and is the subject of the illustrated example here. As before, <E> represents the generic class parameter. The Grid type uses a base64 representation for its contents.

    ## Bridges Visualization

    -   Once all your code is in order, run your file.
    -   Assuming all your code is correct and it compiles correctly, a link to the Bridges website will be generated on the console.
    -   Copy/paste this link into your favorite browser to view a visualization of the data structure you just created.
    -   It should look something like this:

    Well done! Youâ€™ve just created your Bridges Singly Color Grid based Checker Board project!
