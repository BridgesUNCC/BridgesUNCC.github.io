`Array<E>` implements arrays in BRIDGES, and it can be used to create arrays of any generic type.

Bridges Arrays support up to 3 dimensions. The `setDimensions()` method is used to set the array dimensions and allocate storage. Bridges creates arrays of `Element<E>`, which can be used to set visual properties.

## Example Details

-   The 3 examples illustrate creation of arrays of Bridges elements in 1D, 2D, 3D.
-   Indexing into the array is demonstrated, as well as setting visual attributes
-   Applications include sorting algorithms, stacks, queues (to show status of data structure operations, for instance).

## Bridges Visualization

- Once all your code is in order, run your file.
- Assuming all your code is correct and it compiles correctly, a link to the Bridges website will be generated on the console.
- Copy/paste this link into your favorite browser to view a visualization of the data structure you just created.
- It should look something like this:

Well done! Youâ€™ve just created your Bridges Singly Linked List project!
