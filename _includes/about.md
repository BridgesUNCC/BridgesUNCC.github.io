<b>BRIDGES</b>(<i>Bridging Real-world Infrastructure 
Designed to Goal-align, Engage, and Stimulate</i>), an NSF TUES project, 
is focused on providing easy-to-use interfaces to real-world 
internet-based information systems, that are exciting, engaging and 
commonly used by undergraduate students, such as social network data, 
scientific or engineering data.  The BRIDGES toolkit provides a set of 
classes(C++  and Java are supported) that serve as building blocks
to the common CS data structures (lists, tree structures, graphs) used in 
freshmen/sohpomore level computer science. BRIDGES makes it easy to (1) 
import, use and manipulate real-world data sets as part of routine student 
projects,  and (2) provides visualizations of the data structures 
constructed by the student as part of his/her project.
