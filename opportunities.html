<h2><u>New BRIDGES Adopters and Partners</u></h2> <p>
BRIDGES (Bridging Real-world Infrastructure Designed to Goal-align, Engage, 
and Stimulate), an NSF TUES/IUSE  project, is focused on providing 
easy-to-use interfaces to real-world internet-based information systems, 
that are exciting and engaging, such as social network data, entertainment
(movies, songs),  encyclopaedia type systems (Wikipedia), scientific or 
engineering data. The BRIDGES toolkit provides a set of classes (C++, 
Java and  Python) that serve as building blocks to  common CS data structures 
(arrays, lists, tree structures, graphs, game grids) used in 
freshmen/sophomore level computer science. BRIDGES makes it easy to 
(1) import, use and manipulate real-world data sets as part of routine 
student programming projects, and (2) provides visualizations of the 
data structures, plots of complexity measures, game grids,  all 
constructed/used by the student as part of his/her project.</p>

<p>See the  <a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io/index.html"> BRIDGES</a> 
website main page for some examples, and a short video of what 
BRIDGES is about. </p>

<p>While the BRIDGES project was originally proposed to support courses in data structures, we are now expanding  BRIDGES in the following ways that will make it more attractive to instructors:</p>

<ol>
<li>  <b>Algorithms courses:</b> BRIDGES now provides the infrastructure 
(benchmarking tools and scaffolds) to run algorithms of varying data sizes  
and generate plots of complexity; this will be useful to give students a 
stronger foundation in CS, and serve to compare different algorithms or 
data structures to solve the same problem. These new capabilities will 
provide a more comprehensive treatment of data structures and algorithms 
within the same environment, without relying on external tools. See for instance, a 
<a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io/assignments/data//29-SortingBenchmark/README.html"> Sorting example </a> and 
<a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io/assignments/data//9-ShortestPathOSM/README.html"> Shortest Path </a> example using Open Street Map data.

<li> <b>BRIDGES Games:</b> As demoed at ACM SIGCSE 2019, we have added the ability to build <i>simple 2D-based games</i>  using the BRIDGES infrastructure. These capabilities are especially appropriate for CS1, CS2 and high school AP CS curriculum. See this <a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io/tutorials/NonBlockingGame.html">game tutorial link</a>  for additional information.
</li>

<li> <b>BRIDGES Assignment Repository:</b>  Based on feedback from previous users of BRIDGES, we have begun building a repository of BRIDGES assignments (borrowing from repos like Nifty). In fact, we have implemented many of the Nifty assignments in BRIDGES. The repository will be more friendly to instructors, with detailed descriptions, scaffolding or starter code, sample images of expected 
output, and possible extensions. Solutions provided to instructors upon request.
Check out our <a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io/newassignments.html">BRIDGES assignment repository</a>. 
</li>

<li> <b>New Datasets:</b> Open Street Map, Wikidata, Audio data (song, 
1D signals) can now be accessed via BRIDGES; Guttenberg Book Collection (in progress); Elevation data via API for any region of the world.
</li>
</ol>

<h3><u>Status:</u></h3> 

<p>We have been testing BRIDGES in our data structures and algorithms courses for the past 6 years.  Close to 2000 students across 10+ universities and colleges
have been impacted by the project.  Surveys of students and pre/post knowledge tests have been quite positive.</p> 

<p>Our continued  funding from NSF is to promote and disseminate BRIDGES to 
institutions external to UNC Charlotte. <b> We are  interested in adopters 
and partners who are willing to  collect student  feedback (via surveys), 
so that we can accurately measure the impact of BRIDGES on student 
performance and engagement</b>. We have instructor stipends available to 
support this effort. In particular, we are interested in new users 
teaching algorithms, data structures,  CS1, CS2,  and high school 
AP CS courses, who can adopt BRIDGES in their courses in Spring of 2021 
and beyond.</p>

<h3><u> BRIDGES Support, Activities, Community Building:</u></h3>

<p>The BRIDGES team will provide full technical support to instructors and students
who are  utilizing BRIDGES as part of their courses.  In addition, we will have
the following optional support/activites for BRIDGES users:</p>
<ol> 
<li> BRIDGES adopters will be invited to monthly meetings to meet with other
BRIDGES users, raise issues of concern, and suggestions towards future BRIDGES
features/development. This would also be a forum for updating users with
new features, assignments and datasets in BRIDGES.
<li> The BRIDGES PIs will provide additional training to new BRIDGES users,
working regularly with them in scheduled times to help instructors improve their courses using BRIDGES. Additional stipends will be provided for long-term commitment to adopt BRIDGES.
<li> A 1-day event  at the end of the semester, that will bring all BRIDGES 
users and any new potential users interested in using BRIDGES, for 
discussions on experiences using BRIDGES, future plans, etc.

<h3><u>Looking for New BRIDGES Developers</u></h3>
<p>We are currently looking for students to help with Bridges.
    We are recruiting both undergraduate  and graduate students.</p>
<p>The students will need to be enrolled at UNC Charlotte, or at Temple Universities. Stipends are available for students working on Bridges.</p>
