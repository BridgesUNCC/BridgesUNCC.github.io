<h2><u>New BRIDGES Adopters and Partners</u></h2> <p>
BRIDGES (Bridging Real-world Infrastructure Designed to Goal-align, Engage, and Stimulate), an NSF TUES/IUSE  project, is focused on providing easy-to-use interfaces to real-world internet-based information systems, that are exciting and engaging, such as social network data, entertainment(movies, songs),  encyclopaedia type systems (Wikipedia), scientific or engineering data. The BRIDGES toolkit provides a set of classes (C++, Java and  Python) that serve as building blocks to  common CS data structures (arrays, lists, tree structures, graphs, game grids) used in freshmen/sophomore level computer science. BRIDGES makes it easy to (1) import, use and manipulate real-world data sets as part of routine student programming projects, and (2) provides visualizations of the data structures, plots of complexity measures, game grids,  all constructed/used by the student as part of his/her project. <p>

See the  BRIDGES website main page for some examples. And a short video of what BRIDGES is about on the site. <p>

While the BRIDGES project was originally proposed to support courses in data structures, we are now expanding  BRIDGES in the following ways that will make it more attractive to instructors:<p>

<ol>
<li>  <b>Algorithms courses:</b> BRIDGES now provides the infrastructure (benchmarking tools and scaffolds) to run algorithms of varying data sizes  and generate plots of complexity; this will be useful to give students a stronger foundation in CS, and serve to compare different algorithms or data structures to solve the same problem. These new capabilities will provide a more comprehensive treatment of data structures and algorithms within the same environment, without relying on external tools.<p> 

See for instance, a Sorting example and Shortest Path example using Open Street Map data.

<li> <b>BRIDGES Games:</b> As demoed at ACM SIGCSE 2019, we have added the ability to build <i>2D board based games</i>  using the BRIDGES infrastructure. These capabilities are especially appropriate for CS1, CS2 and high school AP CS curriculum.  We currently support non-blocking games.
<p>

See this <a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io/tutorials/NonBlockingGame.html
">game tutorial link</a>  for additional information.
</li>

<li> <b>BRIDGES Assignment Repository:</b>  Based on feedback from previous users of BRIDGES, we have begun building a repository of BRIDGES assignments (borrowing from repos like Nifty). In fact, we have implemented many of the Nifty assignments in BRIDGES. The repository will be more friendly to instructors, with detailed descriptions, scaffolding or starter code, sample images of expected 
output, and possible extensions. Solutions provided to instructors upon request
<p>

Check out our <a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io/newassignments.html">BRIDGES assignment repository</a>. 
</li>

<li> <b>New Datasets:</b> Open Street Map, Wikidata, Audio data (song, 
1D signals) can now be accessed via BRIDGES; Guttenberg Book Collection (in progress); Elevation data via API for any region of the world.
</li>
</ol>

<b>Status:</b> <br> <p>

We have been testing BRIDGES in our data structures and algorithms courses for the past 6 years.  Close to 1500 students have been impacted by the project (400 students in the past year) across more than 10 institutions.  Surveys of students and pre/post knowledge tests have been quite positive.<br><p> 

Our continued  funding from NSF is to promote and disseminate  BRIDGES to institutions external to UNC Charlotte.  <b>We are  interested in partners who are willing to  collect student  feedback (via surveys), so that we can accurately measure the impact of BRIDGES on student performance and engagement</b>. We have a limited number of instructor stipends to support this effort. In particular, we are interested in new users teaching algorithms, data structures,  CS1, CS2,  and high school AP CS courses, who can adopt BRIDGES in their courses in Fall of 2020.<br> <p> <p>

Please contact us if you are interested.<br><p>

<h2><u>Looking for New BRIDGES Developers</u></h2>
  <p>We are currently looking for students to help with Bridges.
    We are recruiting both Undergraduate students and PhD student.</p>
  <p>The students will need to be enrolled at UNC Charlotte, or at Temple Universities. Stipends are available for students working on Bridges.</p>
