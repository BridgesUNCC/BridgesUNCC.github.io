## Step 1: Install jGRASP

*   If you do not have jGRASP installed, download it from the [jGRASP site](http://www.jgrasp.org/) and install it on your computer.
*   jGRASP requres Java 1.6 or higher to be installed, else you will get the error "Unable to locate a java executable. Java 6 or higher must be installed to run jGRASP."

## Step 2: Create Bridges Account

*   Visit the Bridges [main page](/) and create yourself an account by clicking the login button on the top navigation bar. After creating your account, click on your profile name in the upper right corner to view your profile. Once in your profile, you will see your API Key; you will need this API key in part 2 of the tutorial(as well as in every BRIDGES program you write).  

**NOTE:** Make sure to remember your password. There is no password recovery option, and you can only have one account per email address.

## Step 3: Create a Java Project

*   Open _Project_ -> _New_
*   Follow the Project menu directions and create a _Java Project_ at a convenient location. This will create a new folder on your drive.

## Step 4: Import Jar File into project

*   Download the Bridges.jar file from [the downloads page](/download/) and save it somewhere convenient on your drive.
*   In jGRASP, Open _Settings_ -> _PATH/CLASSPATH_ -> _Project_ and select the CLASSPATH tab.
*   Click the _New_ button, and enter the path to the Bridges JAR file.

## Step 5: Create a Bridges Program

*   We will illustrate a Singly Linked List Bridges program here - for more details of this program, refer to the [User Guide Tutorials](/Hello_World_Tutorials/Overview.html) that provides fully documented Bridges examples for each data structure.
*   Open _File_ -> _New_ -> _Java_, give your file a name, add it to the project you created in step 3 and press save.

## Step 6: Compile and Execute Bridges Program

*   To compile a class, click on the green plus _Compile_ button at the top of the window.
*   To execute the program, click on the red running man _Run_ button next to the compile button.
*   On the console window, the user will be pointed to a web link for viewing the visualization of the singly linked list.

Check out your visuals at the web link provided by the application

## Step 7: Visualization

*   If your program compiles and executes without errors the weblink points to a visualization of your data structure.
*   Paste this link in your browser and see the result.
*   Your visualization should look something like this.
*   You can do limited interactive operations on the display window - move the nodes, mouse over to see labels, move the entire visualization, etc.
