class \mbox{\hyperlink{classbridges_1_1_kd_tree_element}{bridges\+::\+Kd\+Tree\+Element$<$ K, E $>$}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This class can be used to create K-\/d Tree elements, derived from \mbox{\hyperlink{classbridges_1_1_b_s_t_element}{B\+S\+T\+Element}}. K-\/D trees can be thought of as the spatial equivalent binary search trees and operate on multiple dimensions (2D and 3D are most common). These trees serve as a representation of the underlying geometrically defined spaces. Specialized versions of these trees include quadtrees and octrees, which subdivide into equal sized quadrants octants at each level, respectively. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
\doxysubsection*{Namespaces}

\item 
 \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacebridges}{bridges}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This class can be used to create arrays of type Element$<$\+E$>$ where E is a generic type representation application specific data. Arrays are internally represented as 1D arrays; currently 1D, 2D and 3D arrays are supported. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
