\subsection*{Classes}
\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
class \hyperlink{classbridges_1_1_kd_tree_element}{bridges\+::\+Kd\+Tree\+Element$<$ K, E $>$}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This class can be used to create K-\/d Tree elements, derived from \hyperlink{classbridges_1_1_b_s_t_element}{B\+S\+T\+Element}. K-\/\+D trees can be thought of as the spatial equivalent binary search trees and operate on multiple dimensions (2\+D and 3\+D are most common). These trees serve as a representation of the underlying geometrically defined spaces. Specialized versions of these trees include quadtrees and octrees, which subdivide into equal sized quadrants octants at each level, respectively. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
\subsection*{Namespaces}
\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
 \hyperlink{namespacebridges}{bridges}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This class can be used to create arrays of type Element$<$\+E$>$ where E is a generic type representation application specific data. Arrays are internally represented as 1\+D arrays; currently 1\+D, 2\+D and 3\+D arrays are supported. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
