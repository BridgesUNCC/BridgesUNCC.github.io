	<h2>What is Bridges?</h2>
	<p>
	  The <strong>BRIDGES</strong>(<i>Bridging Real-world Infrastructure
	    Designed to Goal-align, Engage, and Stimulate</i>), an NSF TUES/iUSE 
		project,
	  is focused on providing
	  easy-to-use interfaces to real-world internet-based information systems,
	  that are exciting, engaging and commonly used by undergraduate students,
	  such as social network data, scientific or engineering data.
	  BRIDGES toolkit provides a set of classes(C++  and Java are supported)
	  that serve as building blocks
	  to the common data structures (lists, tree structures, graphs) used in
	  freshmen/sohpomore level computer science. BRIDGES makes it easy to (1)
	  import, use and manipulate real-world data sets as part of routine student
	  projects,  and (2) provides visualizations of the data structures
	  constructed by the student as part of his/her project.

	  BRIDGES currently supports the following types of Elements that are
	  used to construct data structures:
	  <ul>
	    <li><strong>Element</strong>
	      - the basic element(abstract) that just holds application specific data and supports some basic operations</li>
	    <li><strong>Singly Linked List Element</strong>
	      - element that points to one following element</li>
	    <li><strong>Doubly Linked List Element</strong>
	      - element that points to the following and previous  elements</li>
	    <li><strong>Circular Singly Linked List Element</strong>
	      - singly linked element that points to itself </li>
	    <li><strong>Circular Doubly Linked List Element</strong>
	      - doubly  linked element that points to itself </li>
	    <li><strong>Multilist Element</strong>
	      - Generalization of singly linked list element, that permits any element
	      to be a sublist (recursively)</li>
	    <li><strong>Tree Element</strong>
	      - a general tree element with some number of children defined by
	      the user</li>
	    <li><strong>Binary Tree Element</strong>
	      - element that has 2 children, pointing to a left and right child
	      element</li>
	    <li><strong>Binary Search Tree Element</strong>
	      - a binary tree element with an orderable "key" value, to be used in
	      binary search tree implementations</li>
	    <li><strong>AVL Tree Element</strong>
	      - a binary search tree element that also maintains balance factor  and
	    <li><strong>Kd Tree Element</strong>
	      - similar to a binary search tree element but used in problems
			dealing with geometrically defined spaces. This element also 
			creates a binary tree, but has fields to hold a partitioning
			dimension(X, Y, Z) and its value (along the dimension. A Kd Tree
			node splits the space along the dimension into 2 subspaces.
	      </li>
	    <li><strong>Graph(Adjacency List) </strong>
	      - graph container that holds vertices in an array type list and
	      element connections with singly linked lists</li>
	    <li><strong>Graph(Adjcacency Matrix)</strong>
	      - graph container whose representation is an adjacency matrix, with
	      vertex ids	for the two dimensions, and matrix elements containing
	      a boolean(presence/absence of edge) or edge weight.</li>
	  </ul>
	  Bridges also contains a visualization component that allows the user to send
	  a representation of their data structure to a server, to see the data
	  structure that they have built. The user can also change various
	  visualization features such as size, shape, or color of the elements and
	  their links.
	</p>

	<h2>What is an Element&lt;E&gt;?</h2>
	<p>
	  Element&lt;E&gt; is the abstract superclass of all BRIDGES elements, as shown
	  below:
	  <br/><br/><img width="800em" src="./images/bridges-elements-hier2.png"/><br/><br/>
	  You will normally be using these classes to build data structures. Since
	  they are subclasses of Element&lt;E&gt;, they inherit a common set of
	  methods and instance variables, so to a certain extent they will
	  share a common set of behaviors. However, since they are all different
	  classes, they will have methods and instance variables
	  that are unique to their type.
	<p>

	  <h2>What is the &lt;E&gt;?</h2>
	<p>
	  BRIDGES uses generic parameters(consistent with most data structures textbooks
	  today); &lt;E&gt; is a generic parameter. It represents any basic type or
	  object(class), so you can have an SLelement&lt;string&gt; or an
	  SLelement&lt;int&gt; or any other type. In particular, this facilitates
	  Element to contain application specific type, for example, a record containing
	  a (Twittter) Tweet, Earthquake, hospital, airport  or a movie record.
	<p>
	  You may be wondering, if &lt;E&gt; can be any type, then how does Element
	  know how to behave since a boolean does not have the same methods available
	  as a string?
	<p>
	  Since we did not put any restrictions on &lt;E&gt; inside the Element
	  definition,
	  we can only call methods of &lt;E&gt; that are common to ALL classes. Specifically,  there is a getValue() and a setValue() method defined on &lt;E&gt; We will
This provides access to the generic object. Depending on the user's definition of the generic object, additional methods specific to the object will be available.
	  not be allowed to call a method on E that is particular to any one class. Also,
	  as Element&lt;E&gt; is an abstract class, users only access it indirectly
	  via its subclasses.
	<p>
	  In this way, we can allow the Element&lt;E&gt; class to function as a container.
	  The container doesn't care what it's holding and whatever the container is holding
	  doesn't influence the behavior of the container.

	<p>

	  <h2>What about Graphs?</h2>
	<p>
	  Bridges also contains the GraphAdjacencyList and GraphAdjacencyMatrix classes,
	  however, these do not subclass from Element; This is because Graphs 
	themselves are containers, possibly holding Bridges
  elements.  When you interact with the graphs you will typically be
  adding an Element to them or retrieving an Element from them.<br>
  The graph's adjacency lists are built using singly linked elements.
