<h3>Java Getting Started.</h3>

<p>Assuming that your environment is already set to use, this is
fairly straight forward. (If not, look at
the <a href="../bridges_setup.html">Getting Started page</a> for your
environment, or contact your instructor.)</p>

<h3>Create a MinimalGame.java file and copy the following code in.</h3>

<pre class = "prettyprint">
  <div>
    <pre w3-include-html="./testing/java/MinimalGame.java.html" class="prettyprint"></pre>
  </div>
</pre>
