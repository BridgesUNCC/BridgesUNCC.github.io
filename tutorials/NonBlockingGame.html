	<h2>Why Using NonBlockingGame?</h2>

	
	<p>
	  NonBlockingGames is a Bridges abstraction that allows you to program simple games.
	</p>

	<p>
	  At the core, a game is concerned with four things:
	  <ol>
	    <li>Reading <strong>Inputs</strong> (which buttons are pressed).</li>
	    <li>Updating the <strong>game state</strong> using custom game mechanics (where is the protagonist).</li>
	    <li><strong>Rendering</strong> to the Screen (what the screen should look like).</li>
	    <li>Maintaining a <strong>Framerate</strong> of 30 frame per seconds (getting a smooth experience).</li>
	  </ol>

	  NonBlockingGame in BRIDGES deals
	  with <strong>Inputs</strong>, <strong>Rendering</strong>,
	  and <strong>Framerate</strong> by making some assumptions about
	  the kinds of game one can play. More precisely, the NonBlockingGame
	  only enables games to be on a small grid (up to 1024 cells), to
	  use only a few sprites (up to 256 predefined sprites), and to use
	  only a few keys (up to 10 keys). These constraints still enable 
	  building many games and applications, and the programmer only focuses
	  on implementing updates to the game state.
	</p>

	<p>The benefits is that within these constraints, writing a game is
	  very easy. We will look at how to work with a  NonBlockingGame in three
	  steps, 1) Getting something running; 2) Displaying something on the
	  screen; 3) Capturing user input.</p>

 <h3> See also</h3>
<p>This tutorial gives an introduction to the usage of non blocking games. You can find the complete documentation of the features in the Doxygen documentation of the following classes and functions: </p>
	  <ol>

	    <li> NonBlockingGame  <a href="http://bridgesuncc.github.io/doc/java-api/current/html/classbridges_1_1games_1_1_non_blocking_game.html">[Java]</a> <a href="http://bridgesuncc.github.io/doc/cxx-api/current/html/classbridges_1_1game_1_1_non_blocking_game.html">[C++]</a> <a href="http://bridgesuncc.github.io/doc/python-api/current/html/classbridges_1_1non__blocking__game_1_1_non_blocking_game.html">[Python]</a></li>
    
	  </ol>
	
	<h2>1. Getting Started</h2>
	
	<p>A game in Bridges is made by creating a new class for your
	  game that is derived from NonBlockingGame. Your class has to construct
	  the underlying NonBlockingGame object by passing the usual Bridges
	  credentials, the assignment number, and the size of the game
	  board. We will use a 10x10 board as an example. Then the game
	  object needs to be instantiated and the game started.
	</p>
	<p> Minimally, you create a game by writing two functions:
	  <ol>
	    <li>initialize() is called once when the game originally
	      starts. It is typically used to set up all the game logic in its
	      initial state. Think, for instance, about setting up a chess board
	      at the beginning of the game.</li>
	    <li>gameLoop() is called once for each frame of the game. This is the
	      function that you will write to update the game at each frame
	      based on the player's input.</li>
	  </ol>
	  Here is a minimal game pre-written for you.
	</p>
	
	<div class="tabs snippet1">
	  <div onclick="displayCodeSnippet('Java1', 'snippet1', this)">Java</div>
	  <div onclick="displayCodeSnippet('C++1', 'snippet1', this)" >C++</div>
	  <div onclick="displayCodeSnippet('Python1', 'snippet1', this)" >Python</div>
	</div>

	<div class="tabContents snippet1">
	  <div id="Java1" w3-include-html="./Java_NonBlockingGame-GettingStarted.html"></div>
	  <div id="C++1"  w3-include-html="./Cpp_NonBlockingGame-GettingStarted.html"></div>
	  <div id="Python1"  w3-include-html="./Python_NonBlockingGame-GettingStarted.html"></div>
	</div>

	<p>Make sure that you can run the minimal game.</p>
	
	<p>If you follow the URL given to you when the application runs, it
	  will get to to the Bridges webpage that show your game. To see it,
	  you need to 1) be logged in your account, and, 2) click on the "Connect to
	  Game" button.</p>

	<p>If you want to convince yourself that the game is actually
	  running, you can print to the console a simple message when the
	  GameLoop() function is called. You will see that the message will
	  appear about 30 times per second.</p>
	
	<h2>2. What can be Displayed using NonBlockingGame?</h2>

	<p>The display of a NonBlockingGame is based on a grid. The size of the
	  grid can be as small as a single cell, and as big as 1024 cells in
	  total. The biggest square game board is 32x32. However, the board
	  does not need to square, it could be rectangular: for instance a
	  16x64 board, or a 128x8 boards are possible. The size of the board
	  can be controlled by the last two parameter to the constructor of
	  NonBlockingGame.</p>

	<p>Each cell has a background color and can display a symbol
	  painted with a particular color. These colors and symbols enable
	  to compose a wide variety of displays.</p>

	<p>Only 256 colors can be used for either background color or
	  symbols color. The list of colors is available as part of
	  the <a href="http://bridgesuncc.github.io/doc/java-api/current/html/enumbridges_1_1base_1_1_named_color.html">NamedColor</a>
	  are
	  the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/SVG_Recognized_color_keyword_names.svg">SVG
	    Version of X11 color</a>. One can set the background color of a
	  cell using the setBGColor() function. The setBGColor() function
	  takes the row and column of the cell, and the color to paint that
	  cell.</p>

	<p>The usable symbols
	  are <a href="http://bridgesuncc.github.io/doc/java-api/current/html/enumbridges_1_1base_1_1_named_symbol.html">NamedSymbol</a>
	  and are graphically
	  depicted <a href="http://bridges-games.herokuapp.com/img/symbols.png">here</a>. One
	  can display an symbol on a cell and select a color for it using
	  the drawSymbol() function.</p>

	<p>The following code paints the screen's background and writes
	  "HELLO" with symbols.</p>

	<div class="tabs snippet2">
	  <div onclick="displayCodeSnippet('Java2', 'snippet2', this)">Java</div>
	  <div onclick="displayCodeSnippet('C++2', 'snippet2', this)" >C++</div>
	  <div onclick="displayCodeSnippet('Python2', 'snippet2', this)" >Python</div>
	</div>
	<div class="tabContents snippet2">
	  <div id="Java2" w3-include-html="./Java_NonBlockingGame-Display.html"></div>
	  <div id="C++2"  w3-include-html="./Cpp_NonBlockingGame-Display.html"></div>
	  <div id="Python2"  w3-include-html="./Python_NonBlockingGame-Display.html"></div>
	</div>

	<p>Note that the code has been written in the initialize()
	  function. Indeed the gameLoop() function is not going to change the
	  state of the board, so a one time set up is sufficient.</p>

	<h3>Some case study</h3>
	
	<p>Take a minute to consider the following displays that can be created for games Bugstomp, Snake, 2048, and FallingSand</p>

	<div class="example">
	  <img class="exampleimage" src="./images/game-bugstomp.png"/>
	  
	  <p class="exampledescription"><strong>Bugstomp</strong> is a very simple game on a 30x30 grid, where the
	    background is all black and all symbols are white. The character
	    controlled by the player is shown using the 'man' symbol and the
	    bug to stomp is shown using the 'bug3' symbol. The letter and
	    number symbols are used to display the score.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="example">
	  
	  <img class="exampleimage" src="./images/game-snake.png" />
	  
	  <p class="exampledescription">In Snake, a 30x30 grid is used. The cells' background are first
	    colored with two alternating colors to help the player figure out
	    locations easily. The actual snake is displayed also using the
	    background color in grey to show the body and in white to show the
	    head of the snake. The apple to pick are shown with an actual red
	    apple symbol.</p>
	</div>

	
	<div class="example">
	  
	  <img class="exampleimage" src="./images/game-2048.png" />  
	  
	  <p class="exampledescription">The 2048 game is based on tiles arranged in 4 rows and 4
	    columns. Each tile need to display its value which can not be done
	    on a single cell of the NonBlockingGame, So each tile of the game
	    logic is rendered using 6x6 cells of the NonBlockingGame, and the
	    entire game uses a 24x24 board (4x4 tiles each of 6x6 cells). This
	    enables the game to show more complex information such as the
	    value of each tile, using a combination background color to show
	    the value of the time, but also symbols to print an actual
	    number. Also the decomposition of tile in 6x6 cells allows the
	    animation of the game by sliding the tiles one cell at a time when
	    moves happen.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="example">
	  <img class="exampleimage" src="./images/game-fallingsand.png" />
	  
	  <p class="exampledescription">Finally, <strong>Falling Sand</strong> operates on a 30x30 grid and show a
	    simulation of metal, sand and water. The metal is shown with 'gray'
	    'squares', sand is shown with 'sandybrown' 'waves', water is shown
	    with 'blue' 'droplet', and the cursor is shown with a 'star'.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h2>3. Capturing User Input.</h2>

	<h3>Using the keyboard raw state</h3>
	
	<p>At each frame of the game, the gameLoop() function is
	  executed. The programmer can query the user input with functions
	  which return booleans that indicate whether that particular key is
	  pressed. The programmer can query the arrows with keyUp(),
	  keyDown(), keyLeft(), keyRight(); four buttons with keyW(),
	  keyA(), keyS(), keyD(); and two special button keySpace(), and
	  keyQ().</p>

	<p> While there is no mouse or gamepad support, you can think about the key as mapping to a gamepad like that:</p>
	<img width="30%" src="./images/svg/gamepad.svg" />
	
	<p>The following code demonsrates how the keys can be used to display
	  the "HELLO" message only if the Up Arrow is pressed.</p>
	
	<div class="tabs snippet3">
	  <div onclick="displayCodeSnippet('Java3', 'snippet3', this)">Java</div>
	  <div onclick="displayCodeSnippet('C++3', 'snippet3', this)" >C++</div>
	  <div onclick="displayCodeSnippet('Python3', 'snippet3', this)" >Python</div>
	</div>
	<div class="tabContents snippet3">
	  <div id="Java3" w3-include-html="./Java_NonBlockingGame-Input.html"></div>
	  <div id="C++3"  w3-include-html="./Cpp_NonBlockingGame-Input.html"></div>
	  <div id="Python3"  w3-include-html="./Python_NonBlockingGame-Input.html"></div>
	</div>

	<p>Note that the code checking for the input has been written in the
	  gameLoop() function while the code changing the background color
	  has been written in initialize(). The code inside initialize()
	  would not be able to capture user input since it is only executed
	  once, so it has to be inside of gameLoop(). Because the game board
	  is not reset at each frame, the board starts at the beginning of a
	  frame in the same state it was at the end of the previous
	  frame. Since the background color does not need changing, the code
	  that sets the background can be left in initialize().</p>

	<p>However, the code that prints "HELLO" uses symbols to print the
	  message. So the symbols are on the board at the beginning of the
	  gameLoop() function if the up arrow was pressed at the frame
	  before. Therefore, if the up arrow is no longer pressed, it is
	  necessary to remove the symbols by setting them to 'none'.</p>

	<h3>Using the Fire interface </h3>

	<p>The raw state of the keyboard will have an action executed
	  at each frame of the game if the key stays pressed. In many
	  games, this is not what you want. Think of a navigating a
	  menu, you usually do not want that pressing a key to change
	  which option of the menu is selected at each frame.</p>

	<p>The Fire interface enables to only have an event happen
	  every so-many frames when the button is left pressed. You
	  can configure the cooldown of a button (how many frames will
	  pass between two activations) with the SetupFire
	  functions. (There is a function for each key:
	  keyUpSetupFire(), keyDownSetupFire(), ...). Each key has a
	  Fire function such as keyUpFire(), keyDownFire() to know
	  whether the current frame is a fire frame for the particular
	  key. </p>
	<p>If you run the following code, you will see that as long as
	you to not press the up key, the state of the fire event is
	false. If you leave the key pressed, the fire event will
	happen every 20 frames. That cooldown of 20 frames is setup in
	the initialize() function.</p>

	<div class="tabs snippet4">
	  <div onclick="displayCodeSnippet('Java4', 'snippet4', this)">Java</div>
	  <div onclick="displayCodeSnippet('C++4', 'snippet4', this)" >C++</div>
	  <div onclick="displayCodeSnippet('Python4', 'snippet4', this)" >Python</div>
	</div>
	<div class="tabContents snippet4">
	  <div id="Java4" w3-include-html="testing/java/non_blocking_game_fire.java.html"></div>
	  <div id="C++4"  w3-include-html="testing/c++/non_blocking_game_fire.cpp.html"></div>
	  <div id="Python4"  w3-include-html="testing/python/non_blocking_game_fire.py.html"></div>
	</div>

	<h3>Using the pressed/released interface</h3>

	<p>Finally, you may prefer to use an interface that looks more
	  like a pressed/released interface. Think of a button in your
	  typical graphical interface. When you click on it, something
	  happens when you push the button and when you release the
	  button.</p>
	
	<p>Bridges non blocking game framework provides you an interface to
	  enable these types of behavior more easily. A key can be in
	  one of four state: Just Pressed, Still Pressed, Just Not
	  Pressed, and Still Not Pressed. At rest, a key is in the
	  Still Not Pressed state. When you push on the key, it will
	  go in the Just Pressed state for a single frame. On
	  following frames it will be in the Still Pressed state. Once
	  you release the key it will be in the Just Not Pressed state
	  for a single frame; and it will be in the Still Not Pressed
	  state on the following frames.</p>

	<p>Each key has four functions that tell you whether you are
	in a particular state or not: keyUpJustPressed(),
	keyUpStillPressed(), keyUpJustNotPressed(),
	keyUpStillNotPressed(), keyDownJustPressed(),
	keyDownStillPressed(), keyDownJustNotPressed(),
	  keyDownStillNotPressed(), ...</p>

	<p>Running the following code will show you how the key cycle
	through the four states when you press and release it.</p>

	<div class="tabs snippet5">
	  <div onclick="displayCodeSnippet('Java5', 'snippet5', this)">Java</div>
	  <div onclick="displayCodeSnippet('C++5', 'snippet5', this)" >C++</div>
	  <div onclick="displayCodeSnippet('Python5', 'snippet5', this)" >Python</div>
	</div>
	<div class="tabContents snippet5">
	  <div id="Java5" w3-include-html="testing/java/non_blocking_game_state.java.html"></div>
	  <div id="C++5"  w3-include-html="testing/c++/non_blocking_game_state.cpp.html"></div>
	  <div id="Python5"  w3-include-html="testing/python/non_blocking_game_state.py.html"></div>
	</div>

	<p>Despite the NonBlockingGame API is very simple, it is sufficient
	  to make a wide variety of games. Really most games from the early
	  history of video games followed a similar

	<p>Check Bridges <a href="../newassignments.html">assignment</a> page for games to make. The simpler
	  ones to start with are probably Bugstomp, 2048, and Snake.</p>
