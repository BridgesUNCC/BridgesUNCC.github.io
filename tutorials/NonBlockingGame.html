  <h2>Why Using NonBlockingGame</h2>

  
  <p>
    NonBlockingGames is a Bridges abstraction that allows you to program simple games.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the core, a game is concerned with four things:
    <ol>
      <li>Reading Inputs (which buttons are pressed).</li>
      <li>Updating the game state (where is the protagonist).</li>
      <li>Rendering to the Screen (what the scren should look like).</li>
      <li>Doing it at 30 frame per seconds (getting a smooth experience).</li>
    </ol>

    NonBlockingGame in Bridges makes 1., 3., and 4. particularly easy
    by making some assumptions about the kinds of game one can
    do. Namely, the NonBlockingGame only enables games to be on a
    small grid (up to 1024 cells), to use only a few sprites (up to
    256 predefined sprites), and to use only a few keys (up to 10
    keys).
  </p>

  <p>The benefits is that within these constraints, writing a game is
  very easy. We will look at how it works in three steps: 1. getting
  something running; 2. displaying something on the screen;
  3. capturing user input.</p>
 
  <h2>1. Getting Started</h2>
  
  <p>A game in Bridges is creating by creating a new class for your
    game that derive from NonBlockingGame. Your class has to construct
    the underlying NonBlockingGame object by passing the usual Bridges
    credentials, the assignment number, and the size of the game
    board. We will use a 10x10 board as an example. Then the game
    object need to be instanciated and the game started.
  </p>
  <p> Minimally, you create a game by writing two functions:
    <ol>
      <li>initialize() is called once when the game originally
	start. It is typically used to set up all the game logic in its
	initial state. Think for instance about setting up a chess board
	at the beginning of the game.</li>
      <li>gameLoop() is called once per frame of the game. This is the
	function that you will write to update the game at each frame
	based on the player's input.</li>
    </ol>
    Here is a minimal game pre-written for you.
  </p>
  
  <div class="tabs">
    <div onclick="displayCode('Java1',this)">Java</div>
    <div onclick="displayCode('C++1',this)" >C++</div>
    <div onclick="displayCode('Python1',this)" >Python</div>
  </div>
  <div class="tabContents">
    <div id="Java1" w3-include-html="./Java_NonBlockingGame-GettingStarted.html"></div>
    <div id="C++1"  w3-include-html="./Cpp_NonBlockingGame-GettingStarted.html"></div>
    <div id="Python1"  w3-include-html="./Python_NonBlockingGame-GettingStarted.html"></div>
  </div>

  <p>Make sure that you can run the minimal game.</p>
  
  <p>If you follow the URL given to you when the application runs, it
  will get to to the Bridges webpage that show your game. To see it,
  you need to be logged in your account and click on the "Connect to
  Game" button.</p>

  <p>If you want to convince yourself that the game is actually
  running, you can print to the console a simple message when the
  GameLoop() function is called. You will see that the message will
  appear about 30 times per second.</p>
  
  <h2>2. What can be Displayed using NonBlockingGame?</h2>

  <div class="tabs">
    <div onclick="displayCode('Java2',this)">Java</div>
    <div onclick="displayCode('C++2',this)" >C++</div>
    <div onclick="displayCode('Python2',this)" >Python</div>
  </div>
  <div class="tabContents">
    <div id="Java2" w3-include-html="./Java_NonBlockingGame-Display.html"></div>
    <div id="C++2"  w3-include-html="./Cpp_NonBlockingGame-Display.html"></div>
    <div id="Python2"  w3-include-html="./Python_NonBlockingGame-Display.html"></div>
  </div>
  
  <h2>3. Capturing User Input.</h2>

  <div class="tabs">
    <div onclick="displayCode('Java3',this)">Java</div>
    <div onclick="displayCode('C++3',this)" >C++</div>
    <div onclick="displayCode('Python3',this)" >Python</div>
  </div>
  <div class="tabContents">
    <div id="Java3" w3-include-html="./Java_NonBlockingGame-Input.html"></div>
    <div id="C++3"  w3-include-html="./Cpp_NonBlockingGame-Input.html"></div>
    <div id="Python3"  w3-include-html="./Python_NonBlockingGame-Input.html"></div>
  </div>
