  <h2>Why Using NonBlockingGame?</h2>

  
  <p>
    NonBlockingGames is a Bridges abstraction that allows you to program simple games.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the core, a game is concerned with four things:
    <ol>
      <li>Reading <strong>Inputs</strong> (which buttons are pressed).</li>
      <li>Updating the <strong>game state</strong> using custom game mechanics (where is the protagonist).</li>
      <li><strong>Rendering</strong> to the Screen (what the screen should look like).</li>
      <li>Maintaining a <strong>Framerate</strong> of 30 frame per seconds (getting a smooth experience).</li>
    </ol>

    NonBlockingGame in Bridges deals
    with <strong>Inputs</strong>, <strong>Rendering</strong>,
    and <strong>Framerate</strong> by making some assumptions about
    the kinds of game one can do. More precisely, the NonBlockingGame
    only enables games to be on a small grid (up to 1024 cells), to
    use only a few sprites (up to 256 predefined sprites), and to use
    only a few keys (up to 10 keys). These constraint still enable to
    build many games and application and the programmer only focuses
    on implementing updates to the game state.
  </p>

  <p>The benefits is that within these constraints, writing a game is
  very easy. We will look at how to work with NonBlockingGame in three
  steps: 1) Getting something running; 2) Displaying something on the
  screen; 3) Capturing user input.</p>
 
  <h2>1. Getting Started</h2>
  
  <p>A game in Bridges is made by creating a new class for your
    game that derive from NonBlockingGame. Your class has to construct
    the underlying NonBlockingGame object by passing the usual Bridges
    credentials, the assignment number, and the size of the game
    board. We will use a 10x10 board as an example. Then the game
    object needs to be instanciated and the game started.
  </p>
  <p> Minimally, you create a game by writing two functions:
    <ol>
      <li>initialize() is called once when the game originally
	starts. It is typically used to set up all the game logic in its
	initial state. Think, for instance, about setting up a chess board
	at the beginning of the game.</li>
      <li>gameLoop() is called once for each frame of the game. This is the
	function that you will write to update the game at each frame
	based on the player's input.</li>
    </ol>
    Here is a minimal game pre-written for you.
  </p>
  
  <div class="tabs">
    <div onclick="displayCode('Java1',this)">Java</div>
    <div onclick="displayCode('C++1',this)" >C++</div>
    <div onclick="displayCode('Python1',this)" >Python</div>
  </div>
  <div class="tabContents">
    <div id="Java1" w3-include-html="./Java_NonBlockingGame-GettingStarted.html"></div>
    <div id="C++1"  w3-include-html="./Cpp_NonBlockingGame-GettingStarted.html"></div>
    <div id="Python1"  w3-include-html="./Python_NonBlockingGame-GettingStarted.html"></div>
  </div>

  <p>Make sure that you can run the minimal game.</p>
  
  <p>If you follow the URL given to you when the application runs, it
  will get to to the Bridges webpage that show your game. To see it,
  you need to 1) be logged in your account, and, 2) click on the "Connect to
  Game" button.</p>

  <p>If you want to convince yourself that the game is actually
  running, you can print to the console a simple message when the
  GameLoop() function is called. You will see that the message will
  appear about 30 times per second.</p>
  
  <h2>2. What can be Displayed using NonBlockingGame?</h2>

  <p>The display of a NonBlockGame is based on a grid. The size of the
    grid can be as small as a single cell, and as big as 1024 cells in
    total. The biggest square game board is 32x32. However, the board
    does not need to square, it could be rectangular: for instance a
    16x64 board, or a 128x8 boards are possible. The size of the board
    can be controlled by the last two parameter to the constructor of
    NonBlockingGame.</p>

  <p>Each cell has a background color and can display an object
    painted with a particular color. These colors and symbols enable
    to compose a wide variety of displays.</p>

  <p>Only 256 colors can be used for either background color or
    symbols color. The list of colors is available as part of
    the <a href="http://bridgesuncc.github.io/doc/java-api/current/html/enumbridges_1_1base_1_1_named_color.html">NamedColor</a>
    are
    the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/SVG_Recognized_color_keyword_names.svg">SVG
    Version of X11 color</a>. One can set the background color of a
    cell using the setBGColor() function. The setBGColor() function
    takes the row and column of the cell, and the color to paint that
    cell.</p>

  <p>The usable symbols
    are <a href="http://bridgesuncc.github.io/doc/java-api/current/html/enumbridges_1_1base_1_1_named_symbol.html">NamedSymbol</a>
    and are graphically
    depicted <a href="http://bridges-games.herokuapp.com/img/symbols.png">here</a>. One
    can display an object on a cell and select a color for it using
    the drawObject() function.</p>

  <p>The following code paints the screen's background and writes
    "HELLO" with symbols.</p>

  <div class="tabs">
    <div onclick="displayCode('Java2',this)">Java</div>
    <div onclick="displayCode('C++2',this)" >C++</div>
    <div onclick="displayCode('Python2',this)" >Python</div>
  </div>
  <div class="tabContents">
    <div id="Java2" w3-include-html="./Java_NonBlockingGame-Display.html"></div>
    <div id="C++2"  w3-include-html="./Cpp_NonBlockingGame-Display.html"></div>
    <div id="Python2"  w3-include-html="./Python_NonBlockingGame-Display.html"></div>
  </div>

  <p>Note that the code has been written in the initialize()
  function. Indeed the gameLoop() function is not going to change the
  state of the board, so a one time set up is sufficient.</p>
  
  <h2>3. Capturing User Input.</h2>

  <p>At each frame of the game, the gameLoop() function is
    executed. The programmer can query the user input with functions
    which return booleans that indicate whether that particular key is
    pressed. The programmer can query the arrows with keyUp(),
    keyDown(), keyLeft(), keyRight(); four buttons with keyW(),
    keyA(), keyS(), keyD(); and two special button keySpace(), and
    keyQ().</p>

  <p>The following code demonsrates how the keys can be used to display
    the "HELLO" message only if the Up Arrow is pressed.</p>
  
  <div class="tabs">
    <div onclick="displayCode('Java3',this)">Java</div>
    <div onclick="displayCode('C++3',this)" >C++</div>
    <div onclick="displayCode('Python3',this)" >Python</div>
  </div>
  <div class="tabContents">
    <div id="Java3" w3-include-html="./Java_NonBlockingGame-Input.html"></div>
    <div id="C++3"  w3-include-html="./Cpp_NonBlockingGame-Input.html"></div>
    <div id="Python3"  w3-include-html="./Python_NonBlockingGame-Input.html"></div>
  </div>

  <p>Note that the code checking for the input has been written in the
    gameLoop() function while the code changing the background color
    has been written in initialize(). The code inside initialize()
    would not be able to capture user input since it is only executed
    once, so it has to be inside of gameLoop(). Because the game board
    is not reset at each frame, the board starts at the beginning of a
    frame in the same state it was at the end of the previous
    frame. Since the background color does not need changing, the code
    that sets the background can be left in initialize().</p>

  <p>However, the code that prints "HELLO" uses symbols to print the
    message. So the symbols are on the board at the beginning of the
    gameLoop() function if the up arrow was pressed at the frame
    before. Therefore, if the up arrow is no longer pressed, it is
    necessary to remove the symbols by setting them to 'none'.</p>
  
  <h2>Going Further</h2>

  <p>Despite the NonBLockingGame API is very simple, it is sufficient
    to make a wide variety of games. Really most games from the early
    games followed a similar
    pattern. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_(Atari_2600)">Adventure</a>,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)">Rogue</a>,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)">Snake</a>,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron_(video_game)">Tron's Light Cycles</a>,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)">2048</a>,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)">Minesweeper</a>,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_I:_The_First_Age_of_Darkness">Ultima</a>,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossfire_(1981_video_game)">Crossfire</a>,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris">Tetris</a>,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Wars">Advance Wars</a>,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban">Sokoban</a>,
    Chess all follow a similar pattern.</p>
  
  <p>Check Bridges assignment pages for games to make. The simpler
    ones to start are probably Bugstomp, 2048, and Snake.</p>

  <p>NonBlocking games can also be used not for games, but for
    cellular automata simulations. See for instance assignments
    Spreading Fire, and Falling Sand.</p>
