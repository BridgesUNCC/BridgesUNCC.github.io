<h3>Python Getting Started</h3>


<p>Assuming that your environment is already set to use Bridges, there
  is no additional setup steps to perform. (If not, look at
  the <a href="../bridges_setup.html">Getting Started page</a> for
  your environment, or contact your instructor.)</p>

<p>Your code should be pointing to the BRIDGES Python sources (the folder that contains the bridges subfolder).</p>

<h3>Create a MinimalGame.cpp file and copy the following code in.</h3>
