<h2> Example Details</h2>
<ul>
<li> This example illustrates construction of a tree structure with a variable
number of children (currently set to a maximum of 10).
<li> Children are added using the addChild() method, with ordering of children
from left to right and accessed by an integer index (begining at 0).
<li> In the example, a small tree is built, visual attributes assigned
and visualized.
</ul>
