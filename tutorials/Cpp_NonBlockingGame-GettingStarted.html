<h3>C++ Getting Started</h3>


<p>Assuming that your environment is already set to use Bridges, there
  is no additional setup steps to perform. (If not, look at
  the <a href="../bridges_setup.html">Getting Started page</a> for
  your environment, or contact your instructor.)</p>

<p>Basically, the code need to be linked against curl, pthreads, and libbridges.a. libbridges.a is provided in the package for your operating system.</p>

<p><strong>Note that the windows version of BRIDGES in C++ does not currently support games.</strong></p>

<h3>Create a MinimalGame.cpp file and copy the following code in.</h3>

<p>Check out the documentation of <a href="http://bridgesuncc.github.io/doc/cxx-api/current/html/classbridges_1_1game_1_1_non_blocking_game.html">NonBlockingGame</a> for more details.</p>
