<h2>Elements of a BRIDGES Program to access external datasets</h2>
<ul>
  <li> <b> Imports:</b>  This will usually include the BRIDGES and the data
    specific classes, and any needed utility classes.
  <li> <b> BRIDGES Initialization, Credentials:</b>  This is typically done
    <b>once</b> at the beginning of the application. Credentials include
    your user id and application authentication id (available via your
    BRIDGES login). Here this is required to access the DataSource object which controls
	all calls to external datasets.
  <li><b> Retrieving the data</b> This is a single call to a method in DataSource to
	return  object(s) of that data type, and may include parameters.
  <li><b> Printing an example record</b> The program will print an example record of this dataset,
	to illustrate its attributes.
</ul>
