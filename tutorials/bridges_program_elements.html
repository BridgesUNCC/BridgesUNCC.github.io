<h2>Elements of a BRIDGES Program</h2>
<ul>
  <li> <b> Imports:</b>  This will usually include the BRIDGES data structure
    specific header files, classes related to the example, and other
    utility classes.
  <li> <b> BRIDGES Initialization, Credentials:</b>  This is typically done
    <b>once</b> at the beginning of the application. Credentials include
    your user id and application authentication id (available via your
    BRIDGES login).
  <li> <b> Populating the Data Structure:</b> This involves building
    the data structure, as well as including application specific information
    (handled by generic variables that is part of each BRIDGES data
    structure).
  <li> <b> Adding Visual Attributes. </b> This is done through the
    <it>ElementVisualizer</it> (for nodes) and <it>LinkVisualizer</it>
    (for links) classes and supports attributes such size, shape,
    thickness, color and opacity.
  <li> <b> Specifying data structure to BRIDGES, visualization.</b>
    The calls bridges.setDataStructure() and bridges.visualize() specifies
    the data structure handle to BRIDGES for visualization. Multiple calls
    to visualize() will result in multiple visualizations (stacked one below
    the other). Multiple calls to setDataStructure() make sense when the
    the data structure is changing during an application and the user wants
    to visualize its state (for instance sorting application to see the
    state of the list after each insertion or exchange, stack pops/pushes,
    etc).
</ul>
