		<p> <i> BRIDGES works with both C++ and Java. Setting up BRIDGES is slightly
			different , so we provide help pages on building a simple BRIDGES program.
			Currently detailed help pages for using BRIDGES with Eclipse is provided.
			See the links below. However, there are many ways to run a BRIDGES program.
			These distinctions are detailed below:</i> <p>
	<div>
	<h4> BRIDGES(Java Version)</h4>
	<ul>
	<li> A Jar file is provided(see the links on the left) that contains all the needed
		classes to run a BRIDGES program(including on command line, so long as the JAR
		is part of your Java class path.
	<li> <b>Using BRIDGES Java with Eclipse <a href = "./bridges_setup_java_eclipse.html">
				[Detailed Instructions]</a></b>
	<li> <b>Using BRIDGES Java with BlueJ <a href = "./bridges_setup_java_bluej.html">
				[Detailed Instructions]</a></b>
	<li> <b>Using BRIDGES Java with IntelliJ <a href = "./bridges_setup_java_intellij.html">
				[Detailed Instructions]</a></b>
  <li> <b>Using BRIDGES Java with JGrasp <a href = "./bridges_setup_java_jgrasp.html">
				[Detailed Instructions]</a></b>

				[Detailed Instructions]</a></b>
	<li> Instructions for additional IDEs will be provided soon.
	</ul>
	</div>
	<div>
	<h4> BRIDGES(C++ Version)</h4>
	<ul>
	<li> The C++ version is provided with a set of templated classes, all housed in
		header files. Thus, so long as these header files can be accessed by the BRIDGES
		application, that is all that is needed. See the links left for C++ BRIDGES
		Zip archive.
	<li> The C++ version works with the <a href = "https://curl.haxx.se">CURL</a> library,
		for communicating with the web server and transmitting assignments for
		visualization.
	<li> <b>CURL Installation:</b> On Unix flavored platforms (OSX, Linux, Cloud 9), you
		can install Curl as follows (on <b>Windows platforms</b>, follow the instructions
		for MS Visual Studio below):
		<ul>
		<li> Download Curl sources from <a href = https://curl.haxx.se/download.html></a>
		<li> Explode the archive (using tar, unzip, bunzip2, etc.)
		<li> Change to the folder containing the CURL sources and run the following
			commands from a terminal.
		<ul>
			<li>  ./configure  --prefix=path-to-install-curl
			<li>  make
			<li>  sudo make install
		</ul>
		<li> 'path-to-install-curl' is replaced by the path where you want CURL to be
			installed.  For a full set of options, try <i>./configure --help </i> on your
			terminal.
		<li>By default (if install path is not provided with the configure command),
			CURL will be installed in  /usr/local
		<li> The last command should be done using super user permission. If you do not
			have that, then specify a path to a directory you have write access to.
		<li> The library will be installed under a <b>lib</b> folder in the specified path
			and the include files will be under the <b>include</b> folder
		</ul>
	<li> For expert users, or users who prefer command line or makefiles, BRIDGES
		programs can be compiled and linked with the curl library and executed, so long
		as the include(both the Bridges and Curl headers) and library options
		(Curl library) are specified based on their local installation.
