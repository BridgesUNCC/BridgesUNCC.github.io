	<h2> Exploring USGS Earthquake Data Using Binary Search Trees </h3> 
	<h4> <i>Kalpathi Subramanian, Dept of Computer Science, The University of North Carolina at Charlotte, krs@uncc.edu </i></h4>
	<h3> Introduction</h3>
	The <a href = "https://www.usgs.gov"> US Geological Survey (USGS)</a> releases 
	data on all 
	earthquakes that occur around the world. These can be viewed directly via 
	<a href = "http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/">maps</a> or as 
	<a href = "https://twitter.com/usgsearthquakes">Tweets </a>. For the past few
	years, our group has been working on developing an infrastructure called 
	<a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io/">BRIDGES</a>, a part of which provides
	easy to use interfaces to interesting and topical datasets for routine use 
	in freshman/sophomore level computer science courses. In addition, all the basic data 
	structures supported in BRIDGES can be visualized with the data that they store in 
	their structures. Examples of visualizations used in data structures and 
	algorithms courses can be see on the BRIDGES site. Thus, the twin goals of 
	BRIDGES system  is to make it easier 
	for sophomore level students to import interesting real-world datasets and view
	the data and the data structurs they have themselves constructed.
<h3> An example BRIDGES Program that creates and visualizes a  Binary Search Tree</h3>
<p>
The example below illustrates a simple BRIDGES program to build a 3 node binary search
tree. In a full application, a binary search tree ADT will be used to provide the basic
methods to build and manipulate the tree. To run this program, a BRIDGES Jar file
(available at the BRIDGES site) needs to be loaded (the C++ version requires the 
libCURL library and a set of BRIDGES include files).
The visualization will be sent to a weblink output by the program on the console.
See the full set of examples at <a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io/Hello_World_Tutorials/Overview.html">Bridges Tutorials.</a>

	root.setLeft(left);
	root.setRight(right);
			// color the root node
	root.getVisualizer().setColor("red");
			//pass first element of data structure
	bridges.setDataStructure(root);
			//visualize data structure
	bridges.visualize();

	<h3> Project Description </h3>
	The project will explore the use of binary search trees and their underlying 
	algorithms using the USGS earthquake dataset and the BRIDGES infrastructure.
	We have set up an asynchronous process to collect and parse the USGS earthquake
	tweets; the data gets stored in a MongoDB and is transparent to the user.  <i>Thus,
	each time a driver is run to extract the quake data, by default the latest set of
	quakes is extracted, enabling a user to see  the most recent quakes!</i> To
	access the data, the user issues the  following calls from his driver program (after
	creating the BRIDGES Object:
<pre>
	USGSaccount acct = new USGSaccount( "earthquake" ); 
	List<EarthquakeUSGS> eqlist = Bridges.getAssociations(acct, maxElements);
</pre>

	These calls retrieve maxElement(user specified) earthquake records from the DB 
	and are returned in a Java list of objects of type EarthquakeUSGS(which is part 
	of BRIDGES). At this point the user is free to use the data as part of his project. 
	One additional call is required to store the object as part of the BSTElement
	(which is subclassed from Element), for instance, 
<pre>
	root.setValue(eqlist[k]);
</pre>
<h4> Example Project Tasks</h4>
	I have used this data twice so far for students in data structures and 
	algorithms courses.  The project was broken up into 3 parts:
<ol type = "1"> 
	<li> Implement the binary search tree ADT using the text book's implementation
	(carried very little credit since it was already in the text book). 
	<li> Make the needed changes to use the BSTElement object for the nodes 
		and to visualize a set number of earthquakes (using the driver described above). 
		Earthquake magnitude was used as the search key for the tree. Label the 
		nodes to illustrate(mouseover operation illustrates the label) the 
		location, date, time  of the quake. 
		See the earthquake example posted on 
		the <a href="http://bridgesuncc.github.io"/>BRIDGES website </a>
	<li> The last part of the project included the following tasks:
	<ol type = 'a'> 
	<li> Find and highlight the largest earthquake
	<li> Find and highlight the smallest earthquake
<li> Find and highlight the quakes within a user specified range.
	<li> Find and highlight the quakes that satisfy a date (by month, by year, etc)
	<li> Find and highlight quakes by a specified location( for instance, Alaska).
	</ol>
</ol> 
<h4> Intended Students </h4>
The project will clearly be appropriate for  a course on data structures, but the above
tasks can be simplified for lower level students (CS1, CS2) by providing an 
implementation of the ADT and critical functions and engage the students with the 
visualization(CS0/CS1 - might just run the application with an implemented 
interface to just look at the current quakes, while focusing on performance/efficiency 
issues and the motivation behind search trees. More advanced students can use the 
AVL Tree Element object (subclassed from BSTElement) to build balanced binary search 
trees, perform tree rotations(this was the project in our algorithms course), etc. 
The visualizations help engage students and also serve as a more attractive way to 
check their work. Grading is also interactive, promoting more direct interaction with 
students.

<h4> Provided Materials/Documentation</h4>
<ol>
<li> The <a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io">BRIDGES website</a> has complete 
	documentation (C++ and Java implementations are supported); this is an 
	ongoing project so full support to instructors and students are provided 
	by the BRIDGES development team for issues relating to BRIDGES setup.
<li> Documentation on getting started with BRIDGES with various IDEs are provided(not 
	a complete list yet).
<li> All needed software(both C++ and Java versions) are on the BRIDGES website 
	and regularly monitored.
<li> BRIDGES is currently hosted by an external server(Heroku and soon on Amazon), thus
	reliability should be high in terms of server performance.
</ol>

			documented with live examples.
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>

			visualization component. Fully supported by the BRIDGES development team
			to ease the learning curve 
		</td>

		</td> 
	</tr>

		<td> An advanced version using AVL trees can be used for courses on Algorithms,
			by maintaining a balanced search tree, exploring tree rotations, extracting
