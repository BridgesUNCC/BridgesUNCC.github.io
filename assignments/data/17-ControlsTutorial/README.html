<h1>Bridges Games Controls Tutorial</h1>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>To teach students the functions that allow them to interact with their games.</p>
<ol>
<li>Understand the main variables used to run a bridges game.</li>
<li>Learn about the initialize() method.</li>
<li>Understand ways students can implement their own methods and how to traverse the grid using for loops.</li>
<li>Learn about the gameLoop() method and the 10 different controls available in non-Blocking games.</li>
<li>Prepare the main method and run a game.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Variables</h2>
<p>Sets the size of the students grid. Grids are limited to 1024 cells. The largest square grid available is 32 x 32.</p>
<ul>
<li>int gridColumns</li>
<li>int gridRows</li>
</ul>
<p>Variables that will change the color and symbols despalayed in the game.</p>
<ul>
<li>NamedColor myBackgroundColor</li>
<li>NamedColor mySymbolColor</li>
<li>NamedSymbol mySymbol</li>
</ul>
<h2>Functions</h2>
<p>initialize()</p>
<ul>
<li>A required bridges function. This runs before the game loop begins allowing the students an oppertunity to set the colors and symbols of their game before it starts.</li>
</ul>
<p>gameLoop()</p>
<ul>
<li>A required bridges function. A recursive method that will run until the game is over or is disconnected. Students can call their own methods here to make their games more complex.</li>
</ul>
<p>Boolean values that are true when a specific key is being pressed.
-keyUp()
-keyDown()
-keyLeft()
-keyRight()
-keyW()
-keyS()
-keyA()
-keyD()
-keyQ()
-keySpace()</p>
<h2>Main Method and Student Class Object</h2>
<p>Students must structure their class object to call &quot;super&quot; and pass the variables of their bridges account in order for the bridges server to visualize their game.
Within the Class object students can also set their games title and a short description of the game. They must ensure the start() function is called here.</p>
