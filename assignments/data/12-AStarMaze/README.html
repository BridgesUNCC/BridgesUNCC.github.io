<p>Goals</p>

<hr />

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to learn to
 1. Generate a random maze on a 2D Grid
 2. Write the AStar algorithm for traversing a grid 
 3. Display the algorithm at each step to the grid as it traverses the maze</p>

<h2>Programming</h2>

<h3>Tasks</h3>

<ul>
<li>Create a maze on a 2D grid. There are many maze algorithms </li>
<li>Write a pathfinder using the AStar algorithm to traverse the 2D grid</li>
<li>Choose two points on opposite sides of the grid and use the pathfinder get from point a to b. </li>
<li>During each step in the algorithm color in the pathfinder's current position</li>
<li>After the goal is reached pop back and display the full path.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Create the maze</h3>

<p>There are plenty of algorithms for generating a maze. Prims algorithms is a good place to start. Then create a grid to display the maze and keep track of the open positions and walls on the grid.</p>

<h3>Create the pathfinder</h3>

<p>Create a pathfinder that uses the AStar algorithm to traverse the grid towards a goal point.</p>
