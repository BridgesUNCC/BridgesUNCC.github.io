Assignment 12 - AStar Maze
===========================
 Goals
 -----
 The purpose of this assignment is to learn to
 1. Generate a random maze on a 2D Grid
 2. Write the AStar algorithm for traversing a grid 
 3. Display the algorithm at each step to the grid as it traverses the maze

Programming
-----------
### Tasks
- Create a maze on a 2D grid. There are many maze algorithms 
- Write a pathfinder using the AStar algorithm to traverse the 2D grid
- Choose two points on opposite sides of the grid and use the pathfinder get from point a to b. 
- During each step in the algorithm color in the pathfinder's current position
- After the goal is reached pop back and display the full path.
 
### Create the maze
There are plenty of algorithms for generating a maze. Prims algorithms is a good place to start. Then create a grid to display the maze and keep track of the open positions and walls on the grid.

### Create the pathfinder
Create a pathfinder that uses the AStar algorithm to traverse the grid towards a goal point.
