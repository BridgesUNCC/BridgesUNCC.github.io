Assignment 10 - Hurricane Tracker
===========================
 Goals
 -----
 The purpose of this assignment is to learn to
 1. Read and parse data from a csv file
 2. Manipulate a GraphAdjList object
 3. Display several points on a map

Programming
-----------
### Tasks
Read a csv file containing Hurricane position data such as the data given [here](https://www.wunderground.com/hurricane/atlantic/2017/hurricane-irma). Then map this data on a GridAdjList.
### Read the csv file
Parse the csv file data and create a class for storing this data
### Build a graph
Add the data points to the GraphAdjList, choosing points that are not too close together. Color the points from a range from green to red depending on the category at that point. Then go back and add edges between the points from start to end.
