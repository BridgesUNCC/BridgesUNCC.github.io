<h1>Processing 2D Images - 40</h1>
<h2>Example Images</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2>Goals</h2>
<ol>
<li>Working with 2D images.</li>
<li>Implementing simple operations on images, such as color manipulation,
filtering.</li>
<li>CS concepts: 2D array addressing, processing</li>
</ol>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Students are provided with sample images in a simple text format (eg., PPM)
that they read and display using the ColorGrid datatype (an abstraction for
images). Students are asked to perform a number of simple processing
operations on the provided input images, such as the one given above.</p>
<p>Students are provided with a skeleton of an Image class that they will use
to implement the required image processing operations listed below.</p>
<h3>Tasks</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Read Input Image.</strong> You will read images in PPM (text) format, with all
of the data in pure text form. This is a simple format with a header
containing 4 values: A magic number, width, height and maxVal,  maxVal
representing the maximum of the pixel values, which is useful for
scaling when the image values are in a larger range. This is followed
by a  sequence of RGB triplets. Each pixel is thus represented by 3
integer values. For instance, (255, 0, 0) is red at full  intensity.
Sample images are provided. See  Testing pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Display Image.</strong> You will use BRIDGES to display the image by storing it in
a ColorGrid object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Image Processing.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>toGrayScale.</strong> This method will convert the original RGB PPM image into a
<em>grayscale image.</em>  You can use the following conversion formula:</p>
<pre><code> grayVal  = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B
</code></pre>
<p>where R,G, B are the red, green and blue color components. To display
the grayscale image as a PPM image, use the gray value for all 3
components,  for example, (128, 128, 128) is gray value midway through
the range.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>flipHorizontal.</strong> This function will simply flip the pixels in each
row horizontally. In other words, pixel 0 on the row is exchanged
with pixel (n-1),  pixel 1 with pixel (n-2), and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>blend.</strong> This function will blend an incoming image's pixel colors
with the  existing image. As the images maybe of different sizes
(assume incoming image is smaller), you want to center the incoming
image and blend it with the parent image. To blend the image, a
blending factor in the range of 0-1.0 is passed to the function,
which is used to perform a weighted sum as follows:</p>
<pre><code>    pixel_color =  blend_factor*parentImageColor + (1. - blend_factor)*incomingImageColor
</code></pre>
<p>You will do this across each of the 3 components for each pixel.
Sample images/outputs is provided.  For instance, you will blend the
Lenna image  with  the Yosemite image.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>negateRed.</strong> This function will flip the red pixel values around 255
(the max value). For instance, if the red pixel value is 100,
then it becomes 255-100 = 155.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Extensions</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Image Representation:</strong> Images can be represented internally as a 1D array
or 2D array. Representing as a 1D array  allows students to practice
conversion of addresses, which can be useful and relates more to typical
pixel layouts and how images are stored in memory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Filtering</strong> More advanced image processing operations such as convolution
(low/high pass filtering), edge detection, Fourier transform can all be
implemented, depending on the student level and programming skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Personalization</strong> Students can bring their own images (pets, themselves)
and experiment with them, create pseudo colored images. Flexibility and
creativity of students are very powerful engagement indicators. Ensure
they are shared with the whole class.</p>
</li>
</ol>
