### Tasks
The goal of this assignment is to solve a puzzle by finding where pieces of a pin code fit into a background image. The background image is composed of random noise and each number image overlays onto the grid at exactly 1 place. The programmer must determine where this one place is on the background and draw the numbers in revealing the full pin code.
 
### Filling the image class
First the programmer must fill in the empty functions of the image class. These include reading a ppm image, overlaying one image onto another, and finding what position one image overlays onto another without overlap.
