<h1>Assignment 14 - Spreading Fire</h1>

<h2>Source</h2>

<p>This is a nifty assignment from 2007 proposed by Angela B. Shiflet.
<a href="http://nifty.stanford.edu/2007/shiflet-fire/">Source</a></p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to learn to 
 - Organize data in two-dimensional arrays
 - Use data from arrays to control conditional statements
 - Practice recursion
 - Practice simulation techniques
 - Implement probabilities in code</p>

<h2>Programming</h2>

<h4>Tasks</h4>

<ul>
<li>Use loops to populate and update a grid with values that represent trees, empty spaces, and fire.</li>
<li>Define the behavior of a grid cell that contains a fire, trees, or an empty space.</li>
<li>Update the color of the grid cell when the values change.</li>
<li>Continue updating the grid until all trees are burned out or the fire has gone out.</li>
<li>Try different probabilities to see the different behaviors of fire depending on the location of empty spaces, fire, and trees. For example, try making an X across the grid with empty spaces. Or make a grid with empty spaces around the edges.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Empty spaces</h4>

<p>Empty spaces are represented with a yellow color and will not catch fire.</p>

<h4>Trees</h4>

<p>Trees are represented with green and can catch fire if there is a fire in an adjacent cell. However, the condition for catching fire is not only touching fire. There should also be a probability test that determines if it will ignite.</p>

<h4>Fire</h4>

<p>After a certain amount of time, a fire should go out and become an empty cell.</p>
