Geological Survey
=================

Overview
--------

You are a geologist and you want to survey the location of recent
earthquake. Find a route through all the earthquake site to minimize
total distance travelled.


Variants
--------

### Brute Force

### Integer Linear Programming

### Branch and Bound

### Greedy Heuristic

### Christofides

A 2-approximation based on building spanning trees

#### 3/2 approximation

A refinement of Christofides based on spanning trees and matching

### Meta Heuristics

Programming
-----------

1. Get location of recent earthquake using Bridges API.

2. Find a solution using one of the variants described above.

3. Display the tour using Bridges API.
