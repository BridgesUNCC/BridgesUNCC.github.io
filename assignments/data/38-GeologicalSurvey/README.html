<h1>Geological Survey</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>You are a geologist and you want to survey the location of recent
earthquake. Find a route through all the earthquake site to minimize
total distance travelled.</p>
<h2>Greedy</h2>
<p>We will use a greedy algorithm to solve the problem. That is to say,
when we are at a location, we will go next to the closest location
that has not been visited so far. A greedy algorithm will not return
the best route through all the locations, but it provides a decent
solution to the problem quickly.</p>
<h2>Programming</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Get location of recent earthquake using Bridges API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use an array of boolean to record whether a location has been visited or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assume we start at earthquake 0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write a function that returns the earthquake that has not been
visited and which is the closest to a location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write the code to compute a tour using the greedy principle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Display the tour using Bridges API. You can use the graph data structure to display the tour.</p>
</li>
</ol>
