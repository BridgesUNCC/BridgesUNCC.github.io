## Learning Outcomes

1. File I/O
2. Data Visualization
3. Object Oriented Programming


## Goals

The purpose of this assignment is to learn to 
Understand how to read and parse real-world data from text files.
Visualize airports on a world map using BRIDGES API.
Apply randomization techniques to select and manipulate dataset entries.
CS concepts: Graph creation and manipulation, file handling, random number generation.



## Description

### Tasks
Graph Creation: You will create a graph where vertices represent airports. The graph will display 200 airports chosen randomly from a provided dataset.
Airport Data Parsing: You will read data from a file called airports.txt, which contains information about airports (including code, name, city, country, latitude, and longitude).
Random Airport Selection: The program will randomly select airports and add them to the graph. Each airport is represented by a vertex.
Vertex Customization: Each vertex will have a unique color, and its location will be mapped to the geographical coordinates of the airport.
Visualization: You will then visualize the graph, displaying the vertices on a world map passing a `WorldMap` object to the `setMap` function
