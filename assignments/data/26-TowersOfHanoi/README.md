## Learning Outcomes

1. Recursion
2. ArrayLists


## Goals

The purpose of the assignment is to learn to
1. Display Symbols using `SymbolCollection`.
2. Solve a problem using logical steps.
3. Display multiple visualizations to `Bridges`.


## Description

#### Tasks

- Draw 3 rectangles to the screen as pegs for the disks
- Create disk objects with a location and draw them to the first peg
- Move the disks while following the rules of the game
- Visualize to bridges after each move

#### Game Rules

1. Only move one disk at a time.
2. A move consists of taking the top disk and moving it to another peg.
3. Disks that are larger may not be placed on smaller disks.
