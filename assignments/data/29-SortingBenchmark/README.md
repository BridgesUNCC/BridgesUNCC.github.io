Sorting Benchmark
=================


Goal
----

Understand the performance of sorting algorithm by implementing and benchmarking them.

Task
----

We will be sorting arrays of integers

1. Implement two quadratic sorting algorithms.
2. Implement two efficient sortign algorithms.
3. Benchmark the four algorithms against the standard sorting algorithm provided in the standard library, at small scale and at medium scale.
