# Pong
Pong is a simple sports game that simulates table tennis. The game features two paddles and a ball, with the objective being to use the paddles to hit the ball back and forth. The players score points when the opponent fails to return the ball. The first player to reach ten points wins the game.

## Goals
1. Create games using `NonBlockingGame`
2. Work with NamedSymbol and NamedColor
3. Keep score between two players
4. Simulate the game of pong with paddles and a ball.

## Play
Player One: Use the 'W' key to move the paddle up and the 'S' key to move the paddle down.
