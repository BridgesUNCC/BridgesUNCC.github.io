<h1>Quadtree Construction and Search on US City Data</h1>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<ol>
<li>Plot the US city dataset  given their la/long positions Using the
BRIDGES SybolCollection class</li>
<li>Construct a quadtree to store the points for efficient search</li>
<li>Search for a set of cities using the quadtree</li>
</ol>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Spatial data structures such as quadtrees and octrees  are frequently
used in advanced graphics/robotics/games based  algorithms and
applications  for optimizing spatial operations such collision detection,
ray intersection with objects/ When the amount of input geometry is
large, spatial search structures are typically used. Here we will
demonstrate these aspects in a simplified 2D world.</p>
<h2>Reference/Tutorials:</h2>
<p>Going through the shape tutorials is a good idea to get familiar with
the SymbolCollection class hierarchy and its features</p>

<h2>Assignment Tasks:</h2>
<h3>Read the US City data</h3>
<p>Read the US city input data with its lat/long locations (for purposes
of this assignment you can use this as their 2D locations, although in
reality, a conversion to rectangular coordinates would needed). Find the
bounding rectangle of these positions and plot the cities.</p>
<h3>Build a Quadtree to represent the US city data</h3>
<p>Similar to binary search tree that searches for keys in 1D,
quadtrees are a search structure for points or objects defined in 2D.
They are an adaptive search structure, adapting to the distribution of
objects in the region, with more partitioning in denser regions so as
to optimize the search. The main difference is that we are working in
2D space and searching for geometrically defined entities (points, lines,
planar objects, etc). Here  we will use a set of randomly generated 2D points
to represent our &quot;objects&quot; and search for them in a manner similar to a
binary search tree.</p>
<p>Quadtrees partition regions into 4 equal sized quadrants at each step. The patitioning continues only if the new regions have sufficient number of objects,
else they become leaf nodes. See the figure below and note the increased
partitioning in the lower left quarter of the  rectangular region.</p>
<h3>Quadtree Search</h3>
<p>Select a subset of cities, get their position and search for them in the
quadtree you have built. Similar to a binary search tree, your traversal will
follow a path in the tree, but this time you are searching with 2 keys to
identify the branch of the quadtree to follow. Once you find the city (a
linear search at the leaf node is necessary as the node might contain
multiple points depending on the threshold used to stop the tree
construction), label it and plot the cities. See the figures below on what you should be expecting.</p>
<h2>Expected Output:</h2>
<p>The first figure shows all of the US cities plotted. The rectangle is much
larger, since cities in Alaska and Hawaii are included. The second figure shows a set of 100 cities searched for and labeled.  The large orange city is Charlotte, NC!</p>
