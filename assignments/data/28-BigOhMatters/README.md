Complexity Matters
==================

Goal
----

The purpose of this assignment is to understand why algorithms are
judged by their Big-Oh notations rather than a more precise model, or
runtime measurement

Task 1
------

Using Bridges LineChart object, plot the runtime of an algorithm for
problem size ranging from 1 to 10<sup>5</sup>. (Don't use all values
of n, take some values in the middle.)

1. 10<sup>4</sup> n instructions on a machine at 1 MHz
2. 5.10<sup>4</sup> n instructions on a machine at 1MHz
3. 10<sup>2</sup> n<sup>2</sup> instruction on a machine at 100MHz

Task 2
------

Using Bridges LineChart object, plot the runtime of an algorithm for
problem size ranging from 1 to 10<sup>4</sup>. (Don't use all values
of n, take some values in the middle.)

1. 10<sup>4</sup> n instructions on a machine at 1 MHz
2. 10<sup>2</sup> n<sup>2</sup> instructions on a machine at 100MHz
3. n<sup>4</sup> instructions on a machine at 10GHz

Task 3
------

Using Bridges LineChart object, plot the runtime of an algorithm for
problem size ranging from 1 to 10<sup>2</sup>. (Don't use all values
of n, take some values in the middle.)

1. 10<sup>4</sup> n instructions on a machine at 1 MHz
2. 10<sup>2</sup> n<sup>2</sup> instructions on a machine at 100MHz
3. n<sup>4</sup> instructions on a machine at 10GHz
4. 2<sup>n</sup> instruction on a machine at 1PHz

Conclude
--------

Does it really matter that you can get a slightly faster machine if you can get a lower BigOh complexity?

Does it really matter that you can gain a factor of 100 if you can get a lower BigOh complexity?
