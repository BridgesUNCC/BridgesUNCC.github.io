<h1>Complexity Matters</h1>

<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to understand why algorithms are
judged by their Big-Oh notations rather than a more precise model, or
runtime measurement</p>

<h2>Task 1</h2>

<p>Using Bridges LineChart object, plot the runtime of an algorithm for
problem size ranging from 1 to 10<sup>5</sup>. (Don't use all values
of n, take some values in the middle.)</p>

<ol>
<li>10<sup>4</sup> n instructions on a machine at 1 MHz</li>
<li>5.10<sup>4</sup> n instructions on a machine at 1MHz</li>
<li>10<sup>2</sup> n<sup>2</sup> instruction on a machine at 100MHz</li>
</ol>

<h2>Task 2</h2>

<p>Using Bridges LineChart object, plot the runtime of an algorithm for
problem size ranging from 1 to 10<sup>4</sup>. (Don't use all values
of n, take some values in the middle.)</p>

<ol>
<li>10<sup>4</sup> n instructions on a machine at 1 MHz</li>
<li>10<sup>2</sup> n<sup>2</sup> instructions on a machine at 100MHz</li>
<li>n<sup>4</sup> instructions on a machine at 10GHz</li>
</ol>

<h2>Task 3</h2>

<p>Using Bridges LineChart object, plot the runtime of an algorithm for
problem size ranging from 1 to 10<sup>2</sup>. (Don't use all values
of n, take some values in the middle.)</p>

<ol>
<li>10<sup>4</sup> n instructions on a machine at 1 MHz</li>
<li>10<sup>2</sup> n<sup>2</sup> instructions on a machine at 100MHz</li>
<li>n<sup>4</sup> instructions on a machine at 10GHz</li>
<li>2<sup>n</sup> instruction on a machine at 1PHz</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclude</h2>

<p>Does it really matter that you can get a slightly faster machine if you can get a lower BigOh complexity?</p>

<p>Does it really matter that you can gain a factor of 100 if you can get a lower BigOh complexity?</p>
