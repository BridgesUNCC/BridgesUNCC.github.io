	  <b>Step 1: Install PyCharm </b>
	  <ul> <li> If you do not have Pycharm
	      installed, 
	      <a href = "https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/"> download Pycharm </a>
	      and install it on your computer.
	  </ul>

	  <b>Step 2: Create Bridges Account</b>
	  <ul> <li> Visit the Bridges
	      <a href = "http://bridgesuncc.github.io">
		main page</a> and create yourself an account
	      by clicking the login button
	      on the top navigation bar. Then, click 'Sign Up!' at the bottom of the new window. <b>Please ensure that
		your user id is devoid of spaces, as it will be
		used as part of the web link for your projects.</b>
	      After creating your account, click on the profile tab
	      in the upper right corner to view your
	      account details. In this view, you will see your
	      API Key; you will need this API key later in the
	      tutorial(as well as in every BRIDGES program
	      you write).

				Then click on
			<i> Python Interpreter</i>.  You will see the

		<li> We will next import the BRIDGES packages; for this click on the <b>+</b>
				button and you will see another popup window with a <b>search bar</b> 
				at the 
				top; type <b>bridges</b>  (see adjacent window), and once  you click on that
				you can hit the <i>Install Package</i> at the bottom left to install
				the Bridges package. You will see the packages installed as in the 
				adjacent image.  Go back to the main  code window.
