  <h1>CS Materials Workshop</h1>

  <p>Would you like to know how your CS course materials (lecture
  slides, assignments, exams, quizzes, etc.) measure up against
  national curriculum guidelines? And would you like to know how your
  course compares to equivalent courses taught by your colleagues?
  And are you interested in what their materials look like or you
  might want to adapt them to your course, such as a more appealing
  lecture slide set, practice quizzes or more engaging
  assignments?</p>

  <p>At a SIGCSE workshop, there was a lot of discussion on how to
  meaningfully share class material and how to make them
  adoptable. How many times have you seen instructors try to share
  pedagogical material and reach only limited success? We believe CS
  Materials could be an important tool to address these issues.</p>

  <p>We are trying to organize a CS Materials workshop the Saturday
  before IPDPS. This workshop will show you how to input your material
  in the CS Materials system and how to use it to discover other
  materials that you could adopt. Be ready, at the workshop, to
  include the material from a class you teach in the system.</p>

  <p>Stipends are available for workshop attendees.</p>
  
  <p>Contact Erik Saule: esaule@uncc.edu for more information.</p>

<h4> Put a couple of radial graphs showing the classification below. Do  we need to briefly explain the system? </h4>
