  <h1>CS Materials Workshop</h1>

  <p>Would you like to know how your CS course materials (lecture
  slides, assignments, exams, quizzes, etc.) measure up against
  national curriculum guidelines? And would you like to know how your
  course compares to equivalent courses taught by your colleagues?
  And are you interested in what their materials look like or you
  might want to adapt them to your course, such as a more appealing
  lecture slide set, practice quizzes or more engaging
  assignments?</p>

  <p>At a SIGCSE workshop, there was a lot of discussion on how to
  meaningfully share class material and how to make them
  adoptable. How many times have you seen instructors try to share
    pedagogical material and reach only limited success?</p>

  <p>Also, integrating parallel and distributed computing topics in
  Early CS require us to understand what Early CS courses look like
  across the national. (This is also true for any integration of
  content in early computing courses.)</p>
  
  <p>We believe CS Materials could be an important tool to address
  these issues!</p>

  <p>We are trying to organize a CS Materials workshop the Saturday
  before IPDPS. This workshop will show you how to input your material
  in the CS Materials system and how to use it to discover other
  materials that you could adopt. Be ready, at the workshop, to
  include the material from a class you teach in the system.</p>

  <p>Since this workshop will be at IPDPS, we expect attendees to
  collectively bring in a mixture of parallel computing and systems
  courses, but also earlier CS courses possibly including some
  parallel computing topics integrating in these courses.</p>
  
  <p>Stipends are available for workshop attendees.</p>
  
  <p>Contact Erik Saule: esaule@uncc.edu for more information or to
    notify us that you are interested in such a workshop.</p>
