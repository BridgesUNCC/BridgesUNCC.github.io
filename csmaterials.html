  <h1>CS Materials Workshop</h1>
  <h3> <i>Would you like to know how your CS course materials (lecture slides, assignments, exams, quizzes, etc.) measure up against
	national curriculum guidelines? And would you like to know how your 
	course compares to equivalent courses taught by your colleagues?  
	And are interested in what their materials look like or  you 
	might want to adapt them to your course, such as a more appealing
	lecture slide set , practice quizzes or more engaging assignments? 
	</i> </h3> 

  <h4>We are trying to organize a CS Materials workshop the Saturday before
  IPDPS</h4>.</p>
