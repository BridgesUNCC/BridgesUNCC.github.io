\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This class can be used to create K-\/d Tree elements, derived from \hyperlink{classbridges_1_1base_1_1_b_s_t_element}{B\+S\+T\+Element}. K-\/D trees can be thought of as the spatial equivalent of binary search trees and operate on multiple dimensions (2D and 3D are most common). These trees serve as a representation of the underlying geometrically defined spaces. Specialized versions of these trees include quadtrees and octrees, which subdivide into equal sized quadrants and octants at each level, respectively. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
